 Now, to continue the case for the opposition, it brings me a great pleasure to invite onto the stage historian, historian Count Nikolai Toy Story. gentlemen, well, I don't know that I'm very well equipped to talk about celebrities because I don't recognize the names of any of the people who've been mentioned. A celebrity for me would be, well, it's a long time ago, I suppose, in the year of the coronation, Donald Pierce singing by a babbling brook. I could sing it, but I'm sure you couldn't, and you wouldn't want me to either. I think all this talk about celebrities is ephemeral like the celebrities you'll never hear of them again and they'll get old and ugly and have their lips puffed out and they're hardly worth talking about well I'm carried back to the days of my youth when I in the year of the coronation I went to do my first three-month service as a private soldier and like everyone at that age I was 18 I had fallen desperately in love with a French beautiful French film star Anne Vernon who I'd seen in a film with David Niven and I found a lovely coloured photo of her in Illustrated magazine so in my tin cupboard which we had behind our beds inside the door I'd posted Anne Vernon well round came the lieutenant who said anything and Corporal Martin who was very formidable got the military medal in Malaya and he said Tolstoy why is your cupboard shut open it so I opened it there he saw Anne Vernon she was very beautiful he said you know you're not in the British Army you're not allowed pin-ups take it down so I had to but then I went to see I was at Hyde Park Corner when I watched the coronation and there was our queen well she wasn't just our queen She was so beautiful that I forgot all about Anne Vernon and felt passionately and devotedly in love with the Queen. And of course it wasn't difficult to find a nice photo of her. So that went inside the door of my tin cupboard. Next day around came the young officer and Corporal Martin. Corporal Martin saw the door shut. Open that door, Tostov. And he looked. He saw the picture of his commander-in-chief. He looked to me and said, Tolstoy, you're bloody cunning. I wasn't cunning at all. I was just in love. And I honestly think that the whole talk about celebrity culture is so ephemeral. It's not worth even thinking about. It also seems to forget the fact that there have been celebrities before now. In fact, the very reason we don't know is because we've forgotten them. The Victorian Age had its celebrities. It wasn't Lord Roberts. It was the great McDermott or Lily Langtree and before that it was Nell Gwynne and so it goes all the way back through history celebrities come and go and frankly they don't matter one bit yes if we've forgotten them what having them well I remember them but everybody's forgotten them how is their documentation of all of them I'm sorry if everyone's forgotten them if celebrity if being a celebrity is simply something that disappears, how do we have documentation, how do we have people for info? Well, if we take the trouble, you can find out about them, of course. Or if like me you're interested in them, you will remember them. But most people won't, and they won't remember the awful people we have now. And the thought of having one of these celebrities, or anyone, except the hereditary monarch, as our head of state, is quite horrifying. Who, for example, here, unless they're a citizen of that country, has the fact that. faintest idea who is the president of Germany or the president of Italy or the president of Austria. They are entirely hopeless figures. They're not even celebrities, though they should be. I mean, what's the point of a president unless he represents the whole country and is known to do so? But if he's some shuffling chap in a gray suit who comes forward whenever there's an occasion and even the people being introduced to him don't know who he is, why not have a monarch who not only everyone know who. the Queen is because of her magnificent qualities which we've heard justly extolled and her history, but the history of the whole British monarchy. I don't know who the President of Germany is, I confess straight away and I don't want to know. I don't care of it at all. But I do know, I can't even picture him, nor can you, I fear. But I can picture King Charles II. I can picture Henry VIII. I can picture King Harold at Hastings. I even played his part in the reenactment of the battle. I'd like I didn't get an arrow through my eye. The monarchy represents the whole history of this country in a wonderful way because it's a magical way. Some people read a lot of history. Others have a rather peculiar idea of it from which they watch on television but all have some view of it. And our monarchy personifies the whole of that history. No celebrity could ever do that. Anyway, they won't be celebrities. You can't remember who Donald Pierce was. I barely remember. And we none of us know, I don't know who this, Duane is at all. I don't want to know what good can he ever do me. But the Queen does an enormous amount for all of us. And she represents this country, as was pointed out by our earlier speaker. The great thing, as Walter Badgert pointed out in the 1865, I think, is that it is the power that she, the monarchy, denies to the politicians, which is one of its greatest virtues. And we can see that with the succession of appalling prime ministers we've had. The last three a man in a backstair's laboratory wouldn't employ, yes. Do you not think there are a lot of people who actually carry a lot more without Wayne who care about... Sorry, I could quite catch that, who care about Wayne. A lot more about Foyne than the Green. Oh, well, good good. luck to them. I've very... I've frankly doubted. And I have a horrible feeling there are many people just as ignorant as me. No, everyone knows who the Queen knows. Everyone is honored to meet the Queen. The Queen lives. We don't want her to lead an arduous life. But in fact she does. normal people don't actually believe the press when it says that Prince Williams tours an utter disaster. It was in the sour grapes group. But from everything I read, it was perfectly clear that the majority of people like her and the people who wish to replace her are the sort of dubious characters who've coined in everything that gets you up to be at the top in society. And we don't like the idea. of the queen, but in the way this confirms what is so good about the monarchy that it keeps these awful people out of office and having to at least go through the motions of showing respect. Now I'm sure when Boris Johnson goes to see the queen, when he goes through all the long halls and soldiers and the yeomen of the guard and so on, he's quite overawed and humble too when he sees the queen. When he gets out he probably says something practically cheeky and daring to his obsequious aides, but nevertheless, had a powerful effect. He can't say that openly. He can't show any disrespect openly. And the monarchy does represent a very long, hugely long history in a book I'm just finishing at the moment is about how the monarchies of Britain were restored in the beginning of the 5th century after the collapse of the Roman Empire in the West. And it goes right back to all those days when monarchs were regarded as gods or semi-gods. And the divine right of kings, which is falsely taught to mean that the kings can do no wrong, it wasn't that at all, it was that they were answerable to God, and I believe the Queen thinks that too. The grand ceremony, that's why I'm strongly in favour of having a grandiose monarchy, which actually doesn't, in effect, doesn't cost us anything because, as was pointed out earlier, the huge, if one is concerned with pounds selling some pence, by tourism and other acquisitions in respect of the monarchy. But not only that, of course, we don't just think about how much it costs to have the monarchy. I don't even know. The point is that we have an army, we have a police force. We need these. They're expensive. But if the constitution, as run by the queen and a monarchy, is effective, and it's very effective, particularly in these very, particularly divisive times, when people, as rightly said, people don't have respect for authority, then all the more important it is, in fact, it's vital, because we know, as I know from my family history, you might guess that I'm Russian by blood, that what happens when this respect goes, and when people then suddenly all start, become woke, and everyone knows everything before being talked. about it. So I think I hope that you will reject the idea that we have forgotten the motion, but I think that we need show business people in charge. Well I think the further way they keep the better. The
