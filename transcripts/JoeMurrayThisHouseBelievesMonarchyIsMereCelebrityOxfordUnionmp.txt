 Now, it falls on me to introduce tonight's motion. The motion before the house is that this house believes that the monarchy is nothing but a mere celebrity. Open to tonight's debate, it gives me great pleasure to introduce the only guy who challenges me for my fashion sense. Law student from Prepar College, Joe Murray. Thank you, Mr. President, for the incredible opportunity to speak in our historic chamber in tonight's debate. It truly is an honour. Monarchism can only be sustained if it is deemed legitimate. European monarchs in the Middle Ages turned to theology to justify their divine right to rule. When this became ineffective, monarchs sought alternative justifications. The favourites of the early modern period was nationalism and militarism. Empress Catherine the Great greatly expanded the Russian Empire. Meanwhile Napoleon declared himself the Emperor of France and harnessed the momentum in the French Revolution to form his own nationalist monarchy. Yet the effects of monarch-sanctioned colonialism and subjugation were predictably unpopular. This inability to rebrand has left the world with 26 remaining monarchies. Monarchy's existence is dependent upon its legitimacy. Currently such legitimacy is appalled by celebrization. The removal of monarch's constitutional roles alongside the rise of democracy and social media has seen monarchs become mere celebrities. In support of the opposition tonight, I will argue three main points. Firstly, I will highlight how without the monarchies transformation into celebrity, it would have become invaluable. Secondly, I will argue that there is no fundamental differences other than purely theoretical historical archaisms to distinguish between a contemporary monarch and a celebrity. Thirdly, I will turn to the societal reality, whereby in the absence of absolutist monarchs and absolute as monarchs, monarchs and celebrities are equals. However, before I substantiate my arguments, it gives me the great pleasure to introduce the speakers in opposition. First to speak for the opposition is a great friend of mine, Hannah Edwards. She has came back from a debate and contest in Vienna, and I'm sure she will be a formidable speaker tonight. Yet I must say I am unsurprised to see Hannah on the opposition bench. Given that Hannah went to a school, named the King's School, in Canterbury, always surprised to see Hannah speaking in defence of King's. and country. Next you will hear from the renowned royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. Having worked for CNN, BBC, Sky and countless more broadcasters, I'm glad someone has found a market in profiting from the Monarchy's celebrity drama. Third speaking tonight is Count, and yes I did say Count Nicolai Tolstoy. As well as his work as a historian, he is the current Chancellor of the International Monarchus League and the head of the House of Tolstoy. In addition, Nicolai was a parliamentary candidate for the UK Independence Party. Hopefully, his speech will be more persuasive than UKIP's drivel. Next, you'll hear from journalist, author, and royal commentator Angela Levin. Her book titled Harry Conversations with the Prince is due to be released later this year. And given that Harry married a celebrity, I am eager to hear how she can support the opposition when writing the book on a prince who is the essence of monarchy being mere celebrity. Lastly, is Robert Hardinan, a journalist and documentarian with a focus on the royal family. Robert currently White writes for the Daily Mail, a newspaper not so renowned for its objectivity and having an open-minded and inclusive readership. This I sincerely hope for the members' sake that Robert's speech is nothing like an article in the mail. Mr. President, these are your guests and they are truly most welcome. I've already spoken a lot about legitimacy. This raises the question of why monarchy is so reliant upon it. The reality of monikism is that it is the epitome of inequality. A society's unthinking acquiescence to the status quo facilitates royal prosperity to the detriment of all beyond palace walls. History is littered with examples. Sir Nicholas II of Russia lived lavishly in the Winter Palace until the suppressed majority rose up in the February revolution. Similarly, the Shanghai Revolution in China saw the collapse of China's final imperial dynasty after years of discontent. Monarchy is not conducive to effect of governance. An inherited right to rule is one of the least effective tools to determine who ought to run a country. The sense of entitlement, which comes with a close connection to the monarchy, often manifests and being ill-suited to comprehensive policy creation. While Prince William was raised in Kensington Palace, most of Britain grappled with the 1980s hyperinflation and spiral and poverty rates. Wales may be able to sympathise with society's struggles, but they can never, ever truly understand them. monarchy is synonymous with isolationism and classism. The only change are to a pure necessity in order to retain their privilege over the rest of us. At its core, monarchy is an archaic means of organising society. It is the antithesis to meritocracy and economic equality. This inherent characteristic is why monarchs need to justify their continuing existence. A failure to do so will result in the collapse of monarchism. Precisely because of this structural impediment, if the monarchy are not in race celebrity life, there would be no monarchy at all. Now that I have conveyed why monarchy was forced to become me a celebrity, I will show why there are no fundamental differences, despite the theoretical relics of history, to distinguish between a contemporary monarch and a celebrity. To demonstrate this, I'm going to use a hypothetical story. A royal child is likely born into a palace. Meanwhile, a celebrity's child, probably born into a lavish house in Kensington, Chelsea or Manhattan. Both the royal and the celebrity children will go to elite and exclusive private schools, eaten in Britain or Agaulon College in Switzerland or top choices. From there they would be catapulted into elite academia, such as Oxford or the Ivy League, although, admittedly, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did not meet it either. They might as St Andrews, but like, at least it's not Durham. When the Wales and future celebrities socialised, they were already at the pinnacle of high society. Upon their graduation, the world truly is their oyster. The effect of celebrities' generational wealth can now challenge the wealth of monarchy, offering their next generations and parallels opportunities. Paul McCartney is worth an estimated 1.2 billion US dollars, no pre-wainpriced and even greater 3.5 billion rejected. In contrast, Forbes estimates the Queen's personal net worth at around Â£380 million. Of course, this does not portray the true reality of the British monarchy's finances. Nevertheless, it does show that monarchies and celebrities are existing in a similar cycle, whereby their entrenched privilege facilitates the same socio-economic results and influence amounts. Yes, Paul McCartney cannot partake in the state opening of Parliament like the British Monarch. He could potentially watch the ceremony following reports he's being considered for a peerage. Neither could a celebrity invite this leader of the victorious party in the general election to form a government in their name or grant royal assent to turn the bill into an act of Parliament. However, the reality is these are only functions carried out because of reluctance to diverge from tradition. Convention has it that the British Monaco obeys the will of Parliament and the Prime Minister. So when the depiction of meaningful royal power is fundamentally spurious. Compare this to the incredible campaign that by Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford to raise awareness of child food hunger. The royals are more like celebrities than policy makers when it comes to their day-to-de-operations. For example, 26% of the British Royal's public engagements in 2019 were charities which they were patrons of. Yet even a recent analysis has shown that having a charity with royal patronage has no identifiable benefit would it be reputational or financially. When removing the redundant historical relics from a monarchs portfolio, you are left with roles, primarily charity-related, that any celebrity could fulfil. In fact, the rejected, when there is no striking distinction in the roles occupied by a celebrity and a monarch, it is difficult to refute the notion that monarchy is mere celebrity. My last point will focus on how society perceives monarchy and celebrity. A you-gove survey in the first quarter of this year from the most popular person in was Sir David Attenborough, with the popularity rate of 84%. The Queen, despite being one of the most diligent and industrious monarchs the world has ever seen, and I'm sure the librarian is glad to hear me say that, was the 12th most popular, with a rate of 75%. When changing the Generation Survey to Millennials, the Queen is the 69th most popular, with Benedict Cumberbatch, ranking 9th. When the Queen is being compared among fellow celebrities, it surely shows the blurring the boundaries between a celebrity and a monarch. When the British royal family have an Instagram following of 10.7 million and the monarchy's drama can be seen alongside Kim Kardashian on the front pages of the sun and perhaps the Daily Mail, it surely illustrates that the monarchy is seen as celebrity. But the danger of such a blaring is that it conveys monarchy as socially achievable, when monarchy is premised upon social exclusionism. The sadness over the death of Princess Diana, the People's Princess, illustrates the heartfelt connection that the public have developed towards some royals. The public have responded to a celebrity's tragedy in exactly the same way a countless number of times. Ultimately, both for celebrities and royals, any notion of emotional proximity is fallacious. They exist as the haves and the rest of us are nots who exist beneath them. We live in an age devoid of deference. Few living under a monarchy today would say they believe a monarchy is superior. Neither would they say a celebrity is better than them. Well, that's because neither of them are. The only difference between a monarch and a celebrity today is that monochism must continue to justify its existence. Worlds have deemed celebrity the most favourable means to do so. Only time will tell whether they are correct. One thing is for certain though. Monarchy is not what it used to be. Monarchy is Mia celebrity. Thank you. Thank you.
