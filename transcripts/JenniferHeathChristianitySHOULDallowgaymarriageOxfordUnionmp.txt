 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to start with a quote, and now faith, hope, and love abide. These three, and the greatest of these, is love. The church stands at a crossroads, and the choice before them is stark. Today, the church has the option to choose love, to choose faith, and to choose hope, to choose to follow the precedent set by Jesus of loving and treating your neighbour as you would like to be treated. Or the church can choose to continue down a path of oppression based on outdated cultural norms that reject the fundamental message of Christianity. Love. Love is what will redeem us. Love is the reason Jesus died for us. Love is the very foundation of the church. Today, I urge you to vote to open up the church to same-sex couples whose love, humanity and rights can no longer be rejected. I will make three main arguments to you today. The first about faith. The Bible is a key component of Christian faith, and yet we so often ignore the cultural nuances of the time in which the Bible was written in favour of a simply black and white interpretation. The second, about hope. Practical hope that the church will be able to continue its work in spreading Christian values. If the church wants to attract new members and continue in its function as a moral leader of society, the church must be open to modernisation within the Christian faith. And my final argument is about love, love from God, which is neither biased nor discriminating. within marriage, which is not restricted to our patriarchal and historic ideas, and how the church can best express this love to its followers. But first, Mr. President, it falls upon me to introduce the opposition. First up, we have Chloe Davis, who is making up for attending an all-school's school by now dating somebody with the surname Dick. Then we have Ian Paul, who has come a long way from Southampton to Oxford, and I'm sure his maths degree will serve him very well this evening. Next, we have Calvin Robinson, who I'm surprised to see somewhere as prestigious as the Oxford Union, considering he's usually searching for relevance on G.B. News. And finally, Joe, Joe. Finnberg, known for spending his vac days talking rather than working, who is looking forward to having a captive audience. These are your speakers, Mr. President, and they are most welcome. Before I begin my speech, I would like to start by telling you that I am not a theologian. I am not an expert in Bible studies or Christianity. In fact, like the majority of the English I'm not even sure if I am a Christian. There are those speaking after me who are far more qualified to talk about the intricacies of Scripture than I am. But I am here to talk to you from the heart as a sometime congregation member who can see the church from an outsider's perspective and who is not blinded by the limitations of the past. I am here to argue for pragmatism, practicality, and equality within the church. So, beginning with faith. The original tenet of Christian faith is the Bible, a book written over 2,000 years ago, during a time in which slavery was commonplace. Women were seen as inferior, and nobody had chat GPT to write their essays for them. For Christians, the Bible is the word of God, but this has necessarily been interpreted through the eyes of the men of the time. men who were products of their time, just as we are products of ours. Although they did not understand the need for equality within the church, that does not mean that we must be limited in the same way. In Genesis, it is stated that the world and universe were made by God in seven days, and according to the Bible, the earth is only 6,000 years old. Most of us here today would argue that this is patently untrue. Science has shown that the earth is around 4.5 billion years old, that life evolved over millions of years to create the which and wonderful world that we see around us. Many Christians accept the truth of science, and yet this does not alter their faith in God. The metaphor of Genesis is the role of God as an all-powerful creator, not a literal account of seven days of creation. The science has been disproved, but the faith remains. remains. Let us apply this same thinking to the Christian notion of marriage. The sacrament of marriage is supposed to follow Christ's relationship to the church, a love that is selfless, devoted, lifelong. Many same-sex couples experience this love. Can we not see that the cultural norms that dictate marriage within the Bible are just as much a reflection of their time as the science of Genesis. Just as the underlying message of Genesis is that God is our creator, surely the underlying message of teachings on marriage is that marriage should be lifelong, marriage should be loving and devoted. Why can same-sex couples not follow this teaching of marriage in the exact same way that heterosexual couples do? Marriage is ordained to help us support one another in faith, not to oppress us. Marriage has been used in the past to uphold a patriarchal system, but this is simply a product of the time in which the Bible was written. Nobody here would argue that we should still follow the practices of stoning those who do not follow the Sabbath, or say that it is allowable to sell your daughter into slavery, and yet both of these are allowed within the Bible. Faith dictates that we can understand the meaning of the Bible without the need to cling to literal interpretations. We can see beyond the fallacies of the time in which the Bible was written to its true message, a message of faith and love, not blind adhesion to values too long use to oppress others. Secondly, on hope, practical hope for the future of our church as a centre for community, for guidance and for love. too often in the past the church has used its power to harm rather than to help to have any hope for a future the church must move beyond the limitations of its past to promote Christian values for the 21st century, not for the 16th the role of the church must be to promote the Christian values of kindness and charity rather than the continuation of oppression the church can still will be a leading light to encourage widespread acceptance of equality in England, and they must take this opportunity now. Since its formation, the Church of England has modernised many times. The progression of the role of women within the church, from their ordination as priests in 1994, to their ordination as bishops from 2015. The ordination of women priests led to an increase in female. church attendance at the time, something which the church ought to think about in times when attendance is currently falling. Nobody is arguing, or nobody should be arguing, that the ordination of women should be reversed, that women should once again be relegated to an inferior role. Fewer people attend the church each year, and yet the church refuses to modernise in a way that might encourage membership, particularly from young people, whose views are liberal and who are unlikely to currently attend church. The opposition might tell you that intolerant churches are those where membership is rising the most. The way for the Church of England to combat this is not to follow them into promoting oppression, but to promote Christian value for the 21st century. New members have not been attracted to the Church of England, as opposed to intolerant churches, because the Church of England has not yet committed to supporting equality. Over half of Anglicans believe that same-sex marriage should be allowed. If the Church wants to retain these members, the church must move in the direction of modernisation that has helped it so many times before. And now to argue for love. Why do people want to marry in the first place? To celebrate their love, and specifically to celebrate their love in the eyes of God and affirm their joint commitment to the church. The overwhelming message of the Bible and the overwhelming message from Jesus is one of love. John says that love comes from God and who are we to argue? that love is not holy in all its forms and incarnations. Love declares that we must treat our neighbour as we would like to be treated. If heterosexual couples have the right of marriage, surely it is our duty to extend this right to same-sex couples. We should celebrate love in all its forms, and the church must extend love to those couples who have too long been ostracized in the name of religion. Faith, hope and love, the central values of Christian. but values that we can all share in, with or without religion. We have faith, but we no longer need to rely on the cultural norms from biblical times to assert this faith. We have hope, hope that the church can move to a new era of acceptance, where everyone is brought closer to God. And we have love, love for all same-sex couples who have been excluded by the church, and yet know that God's love for them has never wavered. and the greatest of these is love and so it is with love that I urge you to vote proposition tonight and move towards a more equal and a more loving church. Thank you.
