 Good evening. It's such a pleasure to be here at the Oxford Union. Thank you so much for having me tonight. And I would like to thank especially to Charlie, the vice president, that is hosting me. is hosting me thank you Charlie and thank you everyone for coming I was posted to be ambassador here in the UK two years ago and I would like to share with you something very surprising everyone is curious what will be his first diplomatic experience is it going to be the meeting with the Queen or is it going to be a meeting with some colleague ambassadors like the American ambassadors I was thinking to my what will be my first diplomatic experience when I came to London. And I will surprise you all when I will say that my first diplomatic meeting was not with a European ambassador, not with a Far East ambassador, it was actually with my Arab colleagues. The topic of my lecture is New Middle East. And one of the things I want to share with you is how much the Middle East has changed since my predecessor was studying here and speaking with the same students, maybe different students, maybe new students, about the challenges of the Middle East. So when my predecessor was standing here, he said historically Israel signed two peace agreements, one with Egypt and one with Jordan. But since that, on September 2020, another historic step happened between us, the Israelis and our world. And this step is called the Abraham Accords. I would like to share with you a very funny moment that I had. I was hosting for dinner the Bahrainian ambassador. So the Abraham Accords, just to fill you with the details, was a historic peace agreement, was initiated by both the leaders of our countries and supported by the US administration. And basically, from me, from me as Israeli for many years I couldn't travel to Dubai and just last year on Expa Dubai 300,000 Israelis came to visit think about this gap for all my life I couldn't travel there and now suddenly many Israelis are going there and they're being accepted in such a big worm people are so happy to see them so this is not just a political agreement we are talking here about people to people shift in mindset shifting the hearts and minds of people and when we are talking about the Middle East it's very important to understand that we are now in a time in history where more than ever more and more countries want to build this amazing peace coalition with Israel and the biggest question is of course what made it happen and I want I want just to go backwards for us for many years we wanted to reach out to peace with all our neighbors all our leaders starting from our first prime minister David Ben Gurion through the first prime minister that actually signed the peace agreement Menach and Beguin everyone wanted to reach the same goal everyone wanted peace and in the last years peace became reality and how was this reality coming into the world? After so many years we've been trying and trying and suddenly it happened. And the truth is, and the reality is, that the Middle East has changed in a way that more and more countries realized that we, without having serious cooperation with Israel, the challenges in the region can be addressed properly. And what we feel today more than ever, that Israel today, is standing in one of its best point with the Arab world. So we have more friends in the Arab world than ever. Today we can go and travel in the Arab world. It's part of the Israeli way of looking at the region, as some place that is open to us. And I think even more important. I think today more than ever, Arab people in all those countries know that Israel is a friend, that they can have business with Israel, they can have research and development fund like we just had with the UAE. Business is thriving and all this thing is happening because also on the people-to-people level something dramatic happened. But of course there is still the Palestinian issue and I don't want to avoid that because sometimes when you're thinking about Israel the first thing that you're thinking is the country that is having this conflict. And I would like to say that since I was a young girl, all Israeli prime ministers usually had one goal to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And the biggest question is what is the difference? Why it worked out with Egypt, with Jordan, with the UAE, with Bahrain, with Morocco, so many other countries find it easy to come and have peace agreement with Israel, but it didn't happen with the Palestinians. And I would like to share with you some of my thoughts, and I'll be very, very open to your questions after I'll finish my brief. So one of the reasons that there is no peace between Israelis and Palestinians is because of the words that is being chanted outside. Let's think about the demonstration outside. People are saying, and sometimes I think people don't listen to the words because it's okay to demonstrate. Free country, just like Israel. UK and Israel are democracies. But what are they saying? Listen to the words. They're saying, listen to that, because it's coming all the way through this room. Between the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. Have you seen the map of the Middle East? Does it leave any space to Israel to exist? Does it leave any space to Israel to exist? probably not and between the river to the sea the meaning of this thing they're chanting out there is Israel shouldn't exist this is a very radical thing to say think about all the countries in the world most of the countries are not even democracies think about almost 200 countries that can vote in the UN some of them don't respect human rights some of them do really bad things to other people. But can you imagine other ambassador walking into Oxford Union and people outside are not shouting in screaming something against him or against his country. They're basically shouting that his country shouldn't exist. This is a very radical thing to say. No other country in the world gets even the concept and the idea that they shouldn't exist. And just learning the Jewish history, unfortunately we know, that sometimes those radical ideas bring also some radical actions. And you don't want to be part of a group that says some people don't have the right to exist. It's very, very radical. So if the people that were sitting there were just opening the map of the Middle East, they would have realized they're not promoting peace. They're actually distancing peace. And one of the problem again is that the people that are advocating today, the conflict and the issues around the conflict, basically are saying Israel shouldn't exist. And you can't start negotiation when people are denying the right of the Jewish people to have a Jewish homeland. And I think that it's, again, the duty of the people sitting in this room that care, that want to listen, that want to speak up, to speak for peace, because this is our duty. We need to think about the next generations. And in order to achieve peace, you can't say, from the river to the sea, Palestine is free. And I think that this is one barrier that we all need to face, and we shouldn't take this slogan as a slogan that promotes peace. It actually promotes the elimination of Israel, which is something that I believe that no one in this room and many people in this country don't want to happen. The second barrier, when it comes to the Palestinian issue, and again, six different Israeli prime ministers tried to solve the problem, many negotiation was going on, many international summits, many leaders from all around the world that try to create valid solution, they missed something that happened in 2006. In 2006, the... there was a dramatic election held among the Palestinians in Gaza Strip. And this election had a result. The result was Hamas was elected to be the former leader of the Gaza Strip. And the alternative, the PLO leaders, basically, and it was really horrific to see that, the leaders were being thrown from high buildings all around, and the result was a terror regime. controlling half of the Palestinians that are living in Gaza. And Hamas is recognized in this country as a terror organization, also in USA, also in the EU. Think about it for a second. There is a recognized terror organization that is the representative of 50% of the Palestinians. And more than that, the leader of this terror organization is calling to brutally kill Jews in the streets of Israel using axes, something that unfortunately we've seen that happened in the last month. 19 Israelis were killed brutally by a Palestinian terrorist that were incited with those kind of things. I know many Israeli leaders have different approach to how peace should look like. I think none of Israeli leaders think that peace starts when people take axes and killing other people in the streets. And I think this is the case. gap. This is the gap that it can't be bridged just by saying sit and negotiate or just by throwing formulas. The truth is, and if you're asking me where it starts, it starts with education. It starts with the basic idea that when I meet someone that is coming from the Palestinian world, he wants to see peace for our children. And I'm a mother of three young daughters. Every mother, when a child is born in Israel, is a believing and hoping we don't need ever in the future to use force because we believe in peace and and I think that this is where the international community throughout the years missed an opportunity to invest in the real thing which is educating the young generation in order to achieve peace you always need two ingredients brave leaders but also people-to-people motivation and this is the thing we missed in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. And I think till today many people still believe in some myths about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of the myths is the Israeli settlements. Some people saying Jews cannot live in certain places in Israel. Obviously when we look back in history the Israeli-Palestinian conflict didn't start it when settlements started to be built. In 1967 on the 6th, they were when Israelis started to go back to their homeland in Judean, Sumeria, after being attacked from the Arab world. This is when the Jewish community started to be built. But the conflict is 100 years old. The PLO, the PLO was established in 1964, no connection to settlements. And then if we move forward in 2005, Israel made a dramatic political step. It was called the disengagement. Israel uprooted all its settlements in the Gaza Strip and we were hoping for better future. Unfortunately, even when Israel withdrew to the international border, it didn't help. And here comes the real tragedy. When Gaza was holded by Hamas in 2006, massive international support started to get into Gaza. We're speaking about billions of dollars and euros that were given by the international community. And they call it reconstruction of Gaza, building of Gaza. Some people believe that Gaza is going to be a new Singapore. What was the real thing that happened with this money? So unfortunately, some of this money was misused. And instead of building hotels, restaurants, nice places for people to enjoy themselves and enjoy their life. Underneath city was built with tunnels that had just one goal to attack Israeli civilians, to attack innocent Israeli children in their schools, in their kindergartens, and the whole industry started to happen that was firing rockets on our cities and communities. I think in order to have a better future, we also need to speak about that, how the international money is being used by the Palestinian leadership, and how we can get to the point where every single support is being used to the right cause and not for terrorism. The third thing I want to share with you, and I'm sure you have many questions and more to ask, is about UK-Israel relations. As an ambassador, I'm very proud that some massive part of my work is the great cooperation I have with my Arab colleagues. But the majority of my work is to build better future to Israel and the UK. And Israel and the UK are in one of really its best points in history. One of the things that is happening at the moment between our two governments and our really two communities, maybe I should say, is the health cooperation. COVID got us to understand and realize that we can't solve health problems without addressing a global cooperation. And I think that what started as a challenge, that was a global challenge like the pandemic, created massive cooperation between our best people, our scientists and our doctors. And today we are building a program about the future hospitals. How people want to get their medical assistance in the future? What are the challenges? We both our countries, we have public service of the best doctors in the world. And I'm really, really proud that the Israeli health system, together with the amazing, amazing British health system, the NHS, does lots of cooperation that is saving life. Another aspect of saving life is a security cooperation. Israel and the UK are closed and intimate allies when it comes to security. Our both intelligent units are doing amazing work in saving lives by sharing intelligence. And I think it's almost on a monthly basis that we host security delegation, that do the best work between our security agencies coming from the Israeli army, the Israeli forces, and also coming from the Israeli intelligence services, together with the British ones. The third issue, which I think everyone can celebrate, is a new trade deal between Israel and the UK. We just launched the process and started it, but I think in the future, every country wants to be, connected to countries that innovate and with the technological abilities that Israel is bringing to the table together with the leading power of British economy we're going to have a new trade deal very soon I hope so this is my work and I'm happy to share it with you and I'm very very optimistic about the future of our region and I hope that the Abraham Accords will inspire all our neighbors to come and be part of the Peace Circle thank you very much Thank you. up to the floor. We'll start, as you started, talking about the Abraham Records Accords and how, as you said, they mark a meaningful change for Middle Eastern diplomacy. Given that there's been a differing response from various Arab states to Abraham Records and to the normalization of relations with Israel, do you think the Abraham Accords mark an end to pan-Arabism? Obviously this was my speech. I think yes. I think in a way I think we're speaking today about totally different challenges than we had when Israel was established. And it's quite obvious to me that the Arab world today is divided into the moderate Arab countries that want to cooperate, want to have strong coalition with countries like Israel, and to build a better future to our region and to move forward. especially on the aspects of technology and all the climate issues that we have in our region. And as opposed to countries like Iran, and I'm sure you're going to ask me about it, that are spreading radicalization and want to take us back to the medieval ages. So where does Saudi Arabia fall on that spectrum? Where is Israel currently looking at normalizing relations to Saudi Arabia? Can we expect it in the coming years or months? Many people are asking me that. So I think that Saudi Arabia was again one of the close circle when we started to have more deep security relations with the Arab world. It's not yet ready to be normalized like we had with the Abraham, of course, countries. But I do believe in the future, we do call all our Arab friends in the world, in the Arab world, to be part of this amazing momentum of peace. So I can't tell you it's something that can happen in the coming. year, but it's definitely the way to go. We call everyone to join the peace circle. Is part of the desire to normalize relations with Arab states and Gulf states to act as a counterweight to Iran within the Middle East? I think Iran is just one ingredient of that. It's not the whole story. And this is why I was telling you about the people to people aspect, the R&D aspect, the trade aspect, because eventually relationship between countries is not based on one pillar. And I think Iran is a major threat to the future of the Middle East, but not just for the Middle East. When I speak to all the British officials, they all say the same. They all say that Iran is a huge threat to the Western world, not just to Israel, not just, I mean, just to speak maybe a little bit if you open the Iranian issue, I said it's very radical to say that certain kinds, that Israel shouldn't be. exist but this is a country that is not just saying that Israel shouldn't exist, it's actually working that Israel won't exist and it's working by its proxies. Hizbalah, again recognized terror organization that is sitting in our northern border, Hamas recognized terror organizations that is sitting in our southern border, the hutis in Yemen, all those are Iranian proxies. So Iran after the Islamic Revolution is a very radical force, doesn't believe in democracy doesn't believe in human rights and definitely doesn't want Israel to exist because their leadership are declaring on it day and night so this is the reality and this very very dangerous regime wants to have nuclear power so Israel today is fighting with its new friends together with our old friends like like the UK we are fighting this very dangerous regime we'll move on to Iran properly in a second but a couple more questions on the the Abraham Accords first. You said repeatedly how Israel and her new friends were playing more of a role together research and development and trade. Do you think that as Israel becomes less isolated that Israel will play a larger role in the region in terms of influencing and spreading democracy, women's rights, LGBT plus rights? That's actually a very, very serious challenge because democracy is not a thing that is building one day. I think that you need to have a process and basically as a democracy we believe that every country should adopt the vision of equality and the very basic values of democracy is something that we truly believe in but having knowing from history and from many attempts of many Western countries to change the way the Arab world is working it's not a thing that you can impose so basically of course when we speak about partnership and friendships we do want to have share values as well but this is the thing I do here in the UK when we have our shared values so you think that in the long-term Israel will work to promote values of democracy and we do that all the time but we again we're not imposing it because this is not something that is possible you also mentioned the climate problems facing the region and part of the Abraham Accords deal with Jordan I believe was that you have Israel will build certain renewable energy sources in Jordanian territory and they will build desalination plants in Israeli territory. What are the major climate problems facing the Middle East and is Israel worried about them? Yes, climate is a serious issue I think globally and we participated in COP 26 here in Glasgow and we had a I think we had maybe the second largest delegation. We came with our energy minister, I mean of course our Prime Minister came and one of the things we deal with is desert mead-de-bool what's the proper way to say like mid-de-bole desert desert desertification so one of the things we have as a serious problem since Israel was born is the fact that we live in desert areas two-third of Israel is a desert and in order to in order to find solutions to that Israel has become one of the top countries that have water solutions And this is a thing we can definitely share with our friends all around the world. Israel today, some of the Israeli companies are basically making miracles. I was hosting just a few weeks ago, actually it's a very interesting story. Israeli company called WaterGen. So they were hosted by Prince Charles in Buckingham Palace in a beautiful event that the idea was to find all the companies around the world that are dealing with climate problems. And there were many Israeli people. many Israeli businesses were elected to participate in this beautiful dinner. And they came to report about the experience and they said, we are offering something that almost doesn't have a competition because they also do things that are available to buy in like a minimum rate. And this is the thing that is appealing to many countries that can afford expensive solutions. So one of the things we do is we supply water solutions to us. Africa, to Brazil, to many countries around the world that they're dealing with water issues. And this is a thing that Israel, again, is a leading country in technology. So water is a serious issue. And when it comes to agriculture solutions, again, we do lots of work together. And I think the third issue, which is something we all face because of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, is the issue of energy. the world is having today a major energy crisis. And one of the things that is happening at the moment, it's just freshen new from yesterday, we just now made an incredible cooperation together with our partners, with the Egyptians, and we are going to export natural gas to the EU because of the problems that Europe is facing because of the war. So I think all together it's a real revolution that combines again the two pillars that I mentioned in my speech, the peace and the new coalitions that are being created in the Middle East together with the fact that Israel is a leading technological country. Moving on then to Iran as promised. This last year has seen concerted efforts to resurrect the JCPOA Iran nuclear deal. There's a very concentrated period of negotiations in Vienna and Munich earlier this year and both Iran and the United States have claimed that a new deal is very close. Does Israel feel betrayed by this process? First of all, at the moment, it looks like a deal is not even in the options of both the Americans made it very clear that the IRGC is going to be to remain recognized as a terror organization and the Iranians at the moment and the Americans are very far away from any kind of solution to that. So we definitely don't feel betrayed because of one reason. We always say that our security is being handled with our security power and our forces. So we never rely on other people to solve security problems that we need to deal with. This is the basic idea of having an independent state. But when it comes to cooperation with countries like the UK, I mean, this is where I find the energy of my work. I find the similarities in the way we think about the Iranian issue. issue. We both agree Iran shouldn't have nuclear power. We both agree how dangerous the regime is. We both agree that this is the major power that creates destabilization of the Middle East. And all together, maybe we have a little bit of differences between, you know, the tactics in the way to get there. But I think when you summarize it, I think our allies know exactly what's the problem. And I think we work together very hard in order to make sure Iran won't reach the nuclear weapon. Both President Netanyahu have been very publicly opposed to any form of deal with Iran. Surely a bad deal is better than no deal? First of all, at the moment, let's just expect, I think many people don't really understand what's a bad deal, what's a good deal, what exactly this whole JCPOA is all about. So we are speaking after the first JCPOA was signed. And the major problem is, and today I'm speaking not on behalf the State of Israel, but on behalf the official organ that is supposed to say where Iran stands with its nuclear abilities, and it's the IAEA. We have just seen in the last few weeks where the IAEA saying very clearly that Iran is enriching uranium in the way that brings it very close to nuclear abilities that are very, very dangerous for the point of view of America, at the point of view of the UK and the point of view of Israel, the Gulf countries, basically whoever wants a better future both to our region and to our civilization. So when it comes to the results of the JCPOA, obviously it didn't stop Iran, both from creating more and more abilities in order to get to where it wants to get with the nuclear abilities. So for us, it's very clear that the JCPOA has failed. So we're not talking just from, you know, from hindsight point of view. We said that to begin with. And it definitely wasn't effective in stopping the Iranian regime. And we know at the moment the international community, at least our allies in the UK and our American friends, know that at the moment it looks like we're far away from a new deal. And in a way, a new strategy about Iran should be planned. And this is where we stand at the moment. Speaking of nuclear weapons, it is often said that Israel's nuclear arsenal is the worst kept secret in the world. I'm sure you can't comment on this. But if the Iranian government thinks that Israel has a nuclear arsenal, do you not understand why they would wish to develop one of their own? I want to say something very clear. When we are dealing with a dangerous regime that couldn't care less about human rights, that basically is saying, I want to eliminate another country in the world. We're not speaking about the UK having nuclear weapon. We're not speaking about France having nuclear weapon. We are speaking about a very dangerous country that has radical plans of what to do with this power. So with all the respect, this is not a thing that we can even start, you know, discussing because the British government is clear. This is a dangerous regime. wants to use the most radical and the most powerful weapon in the world against other country in order to eliminate it. So I think it's quite clear that we shouldn't encourage the process. I think it's good enough because, again, we are dealing not with France or the UK. We're dealing with Iran. On Sunday, an Iranian colonel was gunned down outside his house by motorcyclists, and Iran has heavily suggested that they think Israeli security forces were behind the attack. How do you respond to these accusations? I don't respond to those. Fair enough. Do you think this is a political ploy from Iran? Or? I said loud and clear, we have at the moment mutual enemy to the West, to the Gulf countries and to Israel. And we all are addressing this issue, and we all fighting it together. We're sharing intelligence with the UK officials. We're sharing intelligence for our American friends. We are doing everything in order to prevent from Iran to have nuclear weapon. I think it's clear enough. There has been a shift in sort of the attitude towards both Iran and Israel from the current US administration. Does Israel feel slightly let down by the Biden administration's approach to Middle Eastern diplomacy? First of all, our friendship with the Americans. We always have, friends always have things that they don't agree on. This is part of a healthy friendship, I believe. But the values we believe in, the fact that America doesn't have a better ally than Israel. And here in the UK, definitely the alliance is stronger than ever. I think we're never disappointed from countries that think different. And again, the most important thing I think in diplomacy is we have an open dialogue with our friends. So they know where we stand. information, we share our perspective about certain things. And on this thing that is our top national security issue, we definitely have an intimate dialogue both with our American friends and with our British friends. So I don't see here a matter of disappointment. When you were referencing the chance from the members and non-members outside, you claimed that the narrative that is often spun is that Israel should not exist. But you see that you see that. You said recently in your answer that Israel is not in the place it was 50 years ago. Israel's defense it looks after by itself. And it is true Israel is not where it was in 1967 or before. If you do not believe there is a serious threat of Israel being wiped off the map, why is such a hostile approach maintained to Iran and as we'll move on to now Palestine? It's totally two different things. Between us and the Palestinian, there is a national conflict going on for 100 years. Between us and the Iranian people, there is no conflict at all. For many years, Israel had very strong ties with the Iranian people. There was a thriving Jewish community in Iran. It's a totally different story. This regime is very radical. So we always make a very clear difference. The regime is the problem. And the regime at the moment wants to have all the power in order to eliminate it. Israel and it says that out loud. So I think that as much as we want to think about ourselves as a strong country, when you have a serious enemy that wants to have the most dangerous weapon in the world, you need to address the problem. So this is the Iranian issue and as I said it's the top priority in our national security issues. When it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we're speaking about there are our neighbors, we want to see a better future, we're making tremendous efforts in order to work on peace from bottom to the top because we're trying to be able to people to people cooperation the future of the economies is definitely on a joint you know work let me give you just one simple example maybe from my experience one of the things I love to do was to go into factories that have Palestinian workers that work together with Israelis and it's such a such a beautiful thing to see that The economy in our region is based on both people's labor and work. And I think one of the tragedies that many people that think that are trying to promote peace, they are trying to segregate between Israel's and Arabs. Something that is totally impossible. Think about it, 20% of Israel's population is Arab Israelis. We live together and the concept of segregation is something that is, I think, is the wrong concept. You've said on several occasions whilst you sat in the Knesset that you think that Palestine has no claim to the Palestinian territories. Do you still believe this? When I speak here, I'm speaking as the ambassador as you know, so you can't ask me political questions, but I can tell you what the Israeli government point of view is. We believe that we need to promote peace and in order to do that, the biggest question is how we cooperate and how we create better opportunities to have peace in the future. As I said, the biggest problem at the moment is the fact that there is Hamas mindset that is being part of, you know, the very basic idea of what people are saying about the future. And part of this Hamas attitude is the fact that many people are not speaking anymore about territories. They're speaking about Jerusalem as the place that they want to put in flames. We've seen just in the last month that they are trying to destabilize Jerusalem. That is the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. So I think, I think again, the issue is how to promote peace, and this is what the Israeli government is trying to do. And again, I'm very proud to be part of a country that knows that we should always work hard in order to achieve peace. If the issue is Hamas, then surely Israeli relations with the government in the West Bank could be more favorable than the attitude towards the Gaza Strip. But there is no at the moment a leadership that wants to negotiate peace. Peace in the past was always accomplished through a direct negotiation. The last time we were holding negotiation, it was during the Barack Obama administration. I think we had maybe the most energetic and the most full of motivation, foreign secretary there and he was trying to. do everything that he could in order to put the two sides to speak. But then almost any time in history that the conversation between the Israeli side and the Palestinian side fell, this was because the Palestinians left the table. And I'm afraid that was the case. So the PLO leadership time after time left the negotiation table. In a way, they don't believe in a direct negotiation, which is the only way to reach peace. And I think that maybe this is where, it's a weakness in their ability to be able to even speak about it. Whilst it is true that in lots of the peace processes, it has been the Palestinian side who have left the negotiation table over the past few decades, and particularly in the last 20 years, the areas of the West Bank that Israel has been prepared to discuss sovereignty over has shrunk dramatically. In the 1990s and the 2000s, Israel was willing to discuss a return to 1967 borders, And then in the early 2000s discussing the borders as defined by the Oslo Accords, and that has sort of been seen in the last few years to no longer be acceptable to the state of Israel. Why is Israel hardened its stance on the territory it's willing to assert a claim on? Let's go back maybe to the very basic question about what is the conflict all about. Is it about territory? So as you know, historically, the Palestinian were offered so many times to have Arab state next to a Jewish state. It started from a very famous historic idea that was born here in this country in 1937 and then moved on to 1947. Every time in the past, they never agreed to have an independent state. And I think part of it is because the conflict was never really about territory. The conflict, and this is the thing that I claim here, and if you check the Palestinian leader, the Palestinian leaders and the way they speak. This is unfortunately the tragedy of why it's not about negotiating territory. It's because they refuse to recognize the right of the Jews to have their own state. And I think the part of the misunderstanding of the conflict is when people are trying to say, wait a second, you can do this and you can do that, but they're not listening to the Palestinian side that is saying, This is not about territory because in 2000, Israeli Prime Minister called Eud Barak offered basically the whole deal. He offered to divide Jerusalem. He offered to giving almost all the territories in Judea and Samaria. The answer was always the same. The answer was no. And then a Palestinian leadership was changing between Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas. Still, when it came to the same point with Netanyahu, The answer was, and with Eud Olmert, the answer was, of course, Omer was offering a different deal than Netanyahu. But with Omer, it was probably the most generous offer the Palestinians ever got. He left the negotiation table. Why has the offer changed, though? It changed for the good for the Palestinians throughout the years. Why is Netanyahu, why is the current state of Israel not willing to offer what Barrett office? With Netanyahu, they weren't willing really to negotiate. It didn't get even to the point where. they were willing to speak. So would, if the Palestinians were happy to come to the table? I'm giving you the answer. So the answer is because the conflict is not about territory. The conflict is really whether Israel should exist. And many of the people that were dealing with negotiation with the Palestinians, they had the sad conclusion that the issue is really not about where is the territory for the Palestinians. The question and the issue is whether Israel will exist. So there's no one. world in which now the State of Israel would return to negotiation table and offer what Barack offered in 2000? I think at the moment there is no Palestinian leader that is willing to have direct negotiation. So I think in a way the biggest question is how you start. And we believe that by the time that the leadership of the Palestinians will realize we need to have a better future together and think about more creative formulas to have better future to our region, we see that we see that the leadership to our region, we see that we We still need to work on the bottom-up piece, which is, again, as I said, economy, just to work about education, I think, which is the most important thing. One more question from me before we open up to the floor, which is, do you think that that hardening of opinion about what's willing to be offered to Palestine or willing to be considered in a theoretical negotiating table has coincided with the levels of mass migration, often supported by the Israeli government into the West Bank, and the migration of over 500,000 Israeli citizens into the West Bank over the last few decades. So again, now I'm speaking on behalf of the Israeli government. The Israeli government sees Judean Samaria as integral part of Israel. It means that for many years, we always thought that the Jewish people have deep connection to this piece of land. And the truth is, the Jewish communities there are 3% of the land. So it's not, it's not. It's not really the territory that it takes. This is the right of a Jew to live everywhere in London. And if some neighborhoods in London, Jews are not allowed to live in, or some places in the UK, Jews will be not allowed to live in, you'll be shocked. You probably will call the police and will say, this is a cruel anti-Semitism. And it's definitely the same when it comes to the Jewish homeland. Jews can live everywhere in their homeland, and we always believe that there is no such a place that in the Jewish homeland that should be not allowed to Jews to live. And we think that the same with Arabs. I mean, you have Arabs living in Jerusalem, you have Arabs living in Haifa, you have Arabs living in Lod and Ramle. So many cities in Israel are mixed cities and we are proud in our coexistence. Is there not a difference between being able to live somewhere and being financially supported by the state to move and live somewhere? I wish. I wish the state of many people that we have a massive housing crisis in Israel. So I'm sure many people would have said, I wish we would have got a support in living some places in Israel. We do try to encourage people to live in the north side of Israel and in the south because this is the Israeli periphery, but I can't say the same about Judean Samaria. I mean, the biggest support that Israel is giving at the moment is the people want to live in the north and in the south. But basically, again, some of the places in Judea, Samaria, extremely expensive. All I can tell you is, again, this is part of the Jewish homeland, and we see the Jewish communities were never a barrier to peace. And the last American administration, it was during the Trump administration, said very clearly, settlements are not obstacle to peace, which was, I think, refreshing to hear, because, as I said, in 2005, when we removed our settlements, the answer we got for that was firing thousands of rockets, on cities in the south side of Israel. So apparently settlements were not the issue. Anyway, we'll now turn to questions from the audience. Please raise your hand on your membership card. I will call on you. Please stand up when a microphone gets to you and ask your question. I ask you all to be politely and abide by the forms of the house. There is no right to reply because I want to get as many questions as possible. So once Her Excellency has given her answer, please sit down and enjoy listening to the next question. So please raise your hand on membership card if you'd like to ask a question. Can you please just tell the... students to say what fields they're studying here in Oxford. Yes, so please sign up to your college annual subject. Let's talk to the member in the yellow shamper. Thank you very much. Thank you very much Mr. Speaker. I will try and keep it brief because I know that other people have lots of questions. My name is Hamza. I go to university college, I speak chemistry. Salamu alaikum, that means peace with you. I want to talk Madam Ambassador about about the government that you represent, your government. To this day, and since its inception, the Israeli government has forcibly and violently displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and denied them their right to return. Palestinians living in Israel are routinely and systematically denied their basic human rights of self-determination, food, water, a right to a lawyer, children are held without charge and kept for long periods of times in military courts and separated from their parents. In Gaza, your government, has created some of the worst living conditions on this earth. It's called an open air prison by the UN. And Israeli arms companies regularly shoot into Gaza to test their weapons and market them as battle ready. In Jerusalem, the IDF Occupation Force targets Muslim worshippers brutalizes them at the Al-Aqsa compound. In Hebron, they separate bus lanes, buses and streets so that Palestinians could walk on one side and Israelis on another. Your government does not consider Palestinians to be full citizens or even human beings worthy of the same rights as an Israeli Jew. So my question to you is about Hamas, which you mentioned several times during your speech, do you not believe, what is the difference to you between a terrorist organization and a government? Because you mentioned that Hamas routinely kills Israeli civilians, so does Israel. You mentioned that Hamas routinely calls for the denial of the existence of the other side, so does Israel. Israel fires into Gaza very regularly. So what do you think, Madame Abasta? Your name is Hamza. I, first of all, the part that I agree in the question of Hamza is the Salamal-a-le-le-com. I really think that the opening was really, really nice about the things you described. So some of the things, unfortunately, and I don't know where you get this information from, but this is my duty to share with you to clear some of the things that are being mentioned as claims toward Israeli policy. policy. Let's start maybe with the easiest question. What's the difference between Hamas as a terror organization and acts of Israeli army when we're defending ourselves? It's very simple and it has international definition. Terrorism is when you use your force in order to intimidate innocent people. Israel never targets civilians and this is the truth and whoever wants to say different will have to deal with, I would say, people that are professional in how Israel is using force. It's very clear that Israel is using force in the way that we will attack only terror targets as opposed to Hamas. Hamas was firing just in the last Gaza conflict rocket to kindergarten. Obviously, kindergartens are not a legitimate target, to international law. So they're firing to schools, to kindergarten, to sometimes, unfortunately, they even hurt our citizens. So what I think is that it's very clear, according to international definition, when you use your force in order to hurt civilians, innocent people, this is when you use terror, and when you're using your army in order to defend your civilians, and you're not targeting civilians, you're targeting civilians, You're targeting just terror targets. This is where we're doing what any other army in the world is doing when it's defending its people. So I think the first thing is very, very clear. And we know terrorists here from this country, this country experience many years of terror attacks. I was just walking the other day in London Street and I asked some people, did you know this London doesn't have, beans. I mean, I just wanted to throw something and one of my security, one of my security guards said, yes, historically is because the IRA used to put bombs in beans and we got rid of them, so people won't be under danger. So this country has massive history with attacks, with civilians being attacked, with terrorism in your streets. You know the difference. And this is my answer. We never target innocent people. We never target civilians. The second question is about Gaza is a big prison. Well, Gaza is being leaded by elected terror organization, and it has an address of who should be blamed for the circumstances of the people of Gaza. Israel doesn't control Gaza, Israel doesn't have settlements in Gaza. Israel made a clear withdrawal in 2005 to the international border. And by the way, one of the questions many people should ask themselves, do we want to duplicate the Gaza? case to other areas in our region. The answer of both Jordan and Egypt will be probably no. We don't want to have a second Gaza. If the results of having election and choosing Hamas as the legitimate leadership of the Palestinians of Gaza, this is unfortunately a horrible tragedy, I think. But you need to blame Hamas for causing all this pain to the people of Gaza. By the way, Jews are being hurt. as well on the other side from thousands of rockets being fired time after time to our cities and as I said to kindergarten and to schools so again you asked me about certain things and you don't ask yourself where is the Palestinian responsibility one of the things you were asking is about why Palestinian refugees are not being let in so I will answer for that there is no country in the world. I can give you thousands of examples that after a war and people are settling in a new country, they're not calling their children and their grandchildren refugees. When people are immigrating to a country, whether they're refugees or not, their children are legitimate citizens of another country. When you go to Lebanon, when you go to some places in Jordan, you see refugee camps of people that are fourth generation, fourth generation after a war and they still call themselves refugees. My husband is a grandson of a refugee. His grandfather was a Holocaust survivor. His grandmother was living in a beautiful house in Austria. Do you see my husband looking for the house of his grandmother in Austria in order to get back his property and everything after what the Germans did to the Jews? It doesn't make sense, isn't it? And the reason it doesn't makes sense is because every any other country and civilization in the world is making sure that the people will have a new life many of the people that came to Israel unfortunately were refugees some of them from our countries some of them from Europe and they build a new life no resources Israel was a very poor country when it started but they build a new life why the Arab leadership keeps on I mean, no other, I'm saying again, this is something that the UN is very famous. When the UN is giving money and budgets to refugees, it never looks at grandchildren and grand grandchildren as refugees. There is only one generation that can be a refugee after a war. The Palestinians are exceptional. And I think this is the point where we need to ask the questions. Why so many generations after a war, they still see them. as refugees. It doesn't make sense, never happen in any other place in the world, and the international community is not recognizing refugees from other places in the world as refugees 70 years, it's already 74, after war happens. So I think those are the questions we need to ask. We'll go to the gentleman in the tie. Hi there, thanks so much for coming and thank you for all the work that you do. Recently, Finally, Israel actually signed a document in the UN Human Rights Council condemning China's current genocide of the Uighur people. So what exactly motivated Israel to move to actually do that action and what are the future policy initiatives that Israel will support to stop the horrific genocide taking place in Xinjiang province and the People's Republic of China? Well, I think on this we work on a larger coalition. It's not like it's Israel's, you know, we're not standing in. alone on this and I think this large coalition again is coming from like minded countries freedom-loving countries like the foreign secretary in this country loves to say and again Israel is a very small country obviously China is a huge country and it needs to be I mean this is one of the biggest powers in the world maybe very soon the strongest economic power of the world and it needs to be addressed in coalitions so as as you said we we do what we do as part of the bigger group of the people that care about human rights all around the world. I think we have time for one more question. I would like to have ladies asking as well if it's okay. No, but of course you can ask a question and just give another lady to ask you. We'll do a team all then. Okay. Gentlemen, Alicia, bye. Madam Ambassador, thank you for taking the time to be here with us. I understand being a worker of an apartheid genocidal state, you might not have that much time so I do really thank you for being here you speak of human rights where were human rights when journalists Shaheen Abwakla was killed by an Israeli bullet and then her body her body wasn't even allowed to be buried peacefully Israeli death squad was there rocking that casket back and forth images that were plastered everywhere where were human rights that day that you speak and hold so dearly to yourself thank you thank you so I was I was expecting to get a question about the tragedy of the loss of life of Shirina Buakla. I want to start with a big sympathy to a journalist that was killed in a crossfire. But we need to understand why Israeli forces was there to begin with. And also, we need to understand that at the moment, as we speak, no one knows what's the bullet and where it came from that killed Shirin Abuakla. And the reason I'm saying we don't know is because, Just after Shirin was killed, our foreign minister called his Palestinian colleague and he said, we want to go for a joint investigation. Just to understand, the investigation is very simple. The Palestinians and Israelis are using totally different weapons. It's very, very easy to understand who shot the bullet. The Palestinians refused. There was a Palestinian doctor, an official Palestinian that was interviewed at the same day of the occasion. And he said, we don't know who shot Shirin Abu Akla. So the first thing that I want all of us to sit in this room after really feeling the sympathy to her family and to understanding this is a horrible human tragedy is to say we can't blame the Israelis as an automatic thing because we don't know. And sometimes it's okay to say we don't know, but we need to ask the question why the Palestinians refuse to have joint investigation. We didn't ask it to be Israeli investigation. We said a joint investigation. So I think, again, unfortunately, journalists get caught in Crossfire as part of their professional duties, and we feel bad for any loss of human life. But to blame the Israelis is definitely not the way to go. And we need to understand again why IDF was acting in Janine, the place where it happened. IDF was going to a massive, net that was in Janine that created 19 Israelis being brutally murdered in our streets just last month. And sometimes the story is not being told. 19 Israeli people have names, have children, have parents, and this is a horrible human tragedy. And they weren't killed in crossfire or in some mistake. They were brutally murdered deliberately as innocent people in the streets of Nebrac, Haderah, Bersheva, Tel Aviv, in a pub while they were having fun with their friends. I think this is the big tragedy that we tell only one side of the story. Israelis always take responsibility and we are always open to investigate. We're not saying we're perfect. But we definitely don't target either journalist or innocent people. But 19 Israelis were killed and no one really paid attention. It wasn't getting headlines, not in the Times, not in the BBC. It wasn't getting a big, you know, a big response of how come people in 2022 can be brutally murdered in the streets of their homeland using axes and knives. And this is, I think, part of the reality we live in. We need to understand the context, the big story, and still after and having said that, we don't know what bullet killed Chirina Buakla, but we feel that we are doing everything we can in order to prevent the loss of human life, whether they're journalists or enough. Thank you, I'll have one more question then. If there's any few members of the audience would like to ask a question to your excellency. No, but I can't. I mean, if there are any, so. Yeah, we're going to get to the blue shop. It's okay. Thank you. Thank you for the talk as well. I'm Sam. I go to St. Hughes and I do archaeology and anthropology. I wonder what you thought of, you know, in British Jewry, especially amongst young people, there's often a move to criticise settlement building and activity in the settlements. And that seems to be, you know, British Jews who love the state, who love Israel, who are Zionists, they kind of focus attention on the settlements. And whilst they want to have, you know, they want to have a constructive approach to the conflict, you know, settlements is often focused on. And I wondered what you would say to them. repeat the question. Can you just repeat the opposite of the question? Yeah, basically what would you say to like young British Jews who are quite liberal in attitude and kind of focus on the settlement building and the issues with settlements as an obstruction to peace? But is the question is about settlements? How would you speak to British students whose biggest concern is about the State of Israeli settlement building? So, okay, so you basically are asking me what to say when the settlement issue is being raised. Yeah, but specifically to young British Jews who see that as the main issue that's an obstruction of peace. Okay, that's a very fair question because, again, it's one of the biggest questions people being asking me. So the most important thing to understand is, first of all, that the conflict has nothing to do to settlements because the conflict that started 100 years ago. So before we can speak about what happened in 1967, the conflict didn't start in 1960s. So we must start from this point. Because many people, I mean, it's not like people care whether people build houses here or there. I always say like kindergartens don't create a massive war attack. Like it's ridiculous almost to say that certain houses can create a clash between people. Basically if you go and walk there and travel there, you can see how much space there is. I mean, it's not like someone is taking someone's house. So I think the basic and fundamental idea behind the, the question about settlements is the concept thinking and the myth that if there wouldn't have been settlements and things would have been okay. So two answers for that. First, the conflict has been going on for 100 years, so it has nothing to do to 1967 settlements being built after 1967. And the second thing, which I think is even stronger, in 2005, Israel committed the first experiment of how the world looks without settlements when it comes to some kind of, you know, better future between us and the Palestinians. In 2005, Israel uprooted 7,000 Jews with their houses. Personally, for me as a young person, it was the first time that I've seen Jews being uprooted from their houses by Israeli government. It was a big drama in Israel. And the result, unfortunately, was worse. People on the other side didn't feel like settlements are solving the problem. Actually, they saw like they can access now the real settlement. which is, you know, Jaffa, Tel Aviv. They see the whole Israeli communities basically as settlements. And I think this is the biggest problem. When it comes to Jewish communities and the international law, which is another issue, it is important to know that according to international, and this was the Israeli case for many years, we have a total legitimacy to build communities there because the Jews have 3,000 years of connection to those places. We are not occupying our own land as we like to. to say. And one of the things that is also important to understand, when Israel was getting the territories in 1967 in a defense war, a totally legitimate war according to the international law because we were under attack. The occupier was the Jordanians. The illegal occupier was the Jordanians. It was never like a Palestinian state there. It's not like we occupied it from Palestine. No, it was the Jordanians that were holding it illegally. And basically, basically there was not a legal sovereign to the land. So Israel and all Israeli, you know, legal experts will always say Israel has a legitimate claim on Judea and Samaria because of long Jewish history and also according to international law. I'm afraid that's all we have time for, ladies and gentlemen. But thank you very much. I would like to thank you all for coming. Thank you very much. Thank you.
