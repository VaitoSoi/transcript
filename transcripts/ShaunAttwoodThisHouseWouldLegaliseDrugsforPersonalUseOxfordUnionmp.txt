 I had a video on my YouTube channel that got over a million hits, but we had to take it down. It was the guard screen in the jail I was housed in in Phoenix, Arizona, run by Sheriff Joe Appiah. Prides himself on being the toughest sheriff, tough on crime and drugs. It's a video of an Errian brother, neo-Nazi gang member, murdering another inmate who refused to beat someone up for the gang. method he used to kill him he says it's smashing this guy's head over and over and over into the concrete 10 minutes in the guard still hadn't noticed and you can see him just stomping on the back of the guy's head and blood just going everywhere 20 minutes in guys well dead by now guard still haven't responded he picks the body up brings it out right in front of the security camera like he's trying to show it off throws it off a balcony it gets stuck in the railing and he starts kicking it over and over again. Only then did the guards notice and put this guy down. This is how much control the gangs have got of the prisons versus the guards. Why am I telling you this story? Because the guy who got murdered was a low-level drug user. The war on drugs has been a war on people who consume the most prolific drug in the world, weed. If you look at the peak of the war on drugs, over half a million arrests a year in America for weed possession, not dealers, weed possession, young people, mostly. And the private prisons got $60,000 per year per person. That's why they went after the lowest hanging through young people with weed. Where did they end up? Let's go back to the jail again. So the jail is run by drug gangs in the UK. The jails and prisons, it's by area. You may have heard of the postcode wars. One postcode of London, fighting another postcode of London over control of the drug. drugs business. In America it's racial gangs. So as I walk in, the neo-Nazzerian brother skinhead guys come up to me, hey, we want a word with you getting that cell over there. And you can't say, no else they're just going to smash your head into the wall. So walk in the cell, they come in behind me, what's your charges? What's your charges? My charges are a little printout. It's all legal terminology. I'm not sure what it means. So I say, I don't know what my charges mean. This is not a good answer. Now they've got me against the wall about to attack me. What do you mean? You don't know what your charges mean. Are you a chomo? you're a chomo? I didn't even know what a chomo was at this point, but choma was child molester. Some charges are K-O-S by the gang, kill on site, such as peterfalf stuff. Other charges are S-O-S, smash on site, drive-by shootings, because women and kids sometimes get hit. Anyone coming in with a sex offense or a crime against the woman, right away the gang is going to try and murder them, or at the very least they're going to attack them. That's called convict justice. In the end, I pulled out my charge sheet. They saw I was in for drugs. Nearly everyone is in prison for drugs. these days, that's acceptable. Then they explain all the rules you must follow, or the whole gang will attack you. If someone calls you a punk, a bitch, or hits you, you must fight them on the spot, or else the whole gang will attack you. You cannot talk to the guards, they'll attack you for snitching, can't say the tales of the races, they'll attack you for them. And on and on and on it goes. Now, the more violence they commit, the higher-up in the gang hierarchy are the tattoos that they earn. To be a full member of any of these drug gangs that run the prisons all over the world, you have to murder someone for them in the jail. So the whole purpose of prisons and the police has been subverted by this insane war on drugs. On our podcast, we've interviewed so many ex-cops. These are people who are on the front line, and they quickly learn that they're putting their lives on the line for nothing, because it doesn't stop the drugs what they're doing. And so many of them are losing their lives. So the drug laws came from a guy called Harry Anslinger. This is the federal. drug laws for weed in America. The jail I was housed in was run by Sheriff Joe Appiah. He was a pro-sagee of Harry Anslinger. And Harry Anslinger was put in charge because the competitor industries didn't want the mass production of hemp to compete against what they were doing. You had fledgling farmer back then. You had William Randolph Hurst with his forests. You had petrochemicals. All these different industries. Henry Ford, he'd made a car out of hemp fiber that was stronger than metal. So they put Harry Anslinger in charge to get rid of hemp and the competition. So he harnessed the racism of the time. This was when black people were being lynched. And he changed the name of cannabis to marijuana, so it sounded Mexican. And he was saying things like, the main reason to make marijuana illegal is its effect on the degenerate races. I'm going to paraphrase now because what he said was so racist and sick and horrendous. He basically said, black people will think they're as important as white people and want to sleep with white women. This guy was one of the first drug czars for decades. Through the United Nations, he told the rest of the world, if you don't sign on for this, America's not going to trade for you, and you're not going to get any aid from us. So that's why the whole world signed on for this, and we're in this mess we're in right now. So I've written five books about Pablo Escobar. Escobar could source a kilo of coca paste. from Peru or Bolivia in the 70s when he was getting started for $60. Because of drug laws creating an inflated black market price, how much do you guys think he could sell a kilo of cocaine for in the 1970s in America? Anyone want to guess? $60,000. Yeah. So drug laws has made worthless plants more valuable than gold. It has been the biggest profit opportunity in the history of the world for organized crime to flood the entire world with drugs and it gets worse every single year. We know from alcohol prohibition it doesn't work. Drug prohibition? We've got stronger drugs than ever, more prolific. I interviewed a psychiatrist out of Canada recently and he said, I wish we could go back to the good old days of heroin. because of fentanyl. So, why does not the government address this issue? Because they learn to profit from it. It's not just the private prisons getting the $60,000 a year of taxpayers' money. Those contracts alone right now are under tens of billions of dollars a year, and they kick down millions to each political party to keep these laws in place. So the purpose of prisons, the police, Take person A out of society that harms person B. Crime for millennia has been defined as murder, robbery, rape. Person A, harms person B. If you're arresting over half a million young people a year for weed possession, if you arrest one person for weed possession, who's that person harming? Themselves at the most. And they're going to throw them in a jail where I was housed, where I saw firsthand these kids getting tattoos and turned into neo-Nazis and becoming heroin users and getting hepatitis C, 90% of the prisoners were injecting drugs. Almost two-thirds of hepatitis C, which slowly kills you by eating your liver up. So this is why I am totally against the continuation of this insane war on drugs. Thank you for listening. Cheers. Thank you.
