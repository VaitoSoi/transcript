 Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote for this motion. The arguments have been made, well, they haven't been made yet, we've had a lot of bluster, no actual arguments yet, the facts they'll come. The time is right, natural justice demands it. Vote for this motion. Actually, before you do vote for this motion, perhaps we ought to think about what you're calling for if you do. You'll be voting for a church which detaches itself from the clear and the consistent teaching of Jesus. When challenged about divorce, Jesus refused to answer the question, but instead goes back not just to the creation of marriage in Genesis 2, but the creation of humanity in Genesis 1. his central affirmation is that humanity is created male and female and this is the basis of marriage and sexual intimacy all other sexual relations he describes as paunae and calls those who follow him to repent off him this is not small print this is central to biblical anthropology and the vision of what it means to be made human bodily and sexed in the image of god it's not an outdated cultural norm It's the consistent view of scripture and of the church. So vote for this motion. Do if you're happy to demand that the church separates itself from the teaching of Jesus. Not only Jesus, but that the church detaches itself from the teaching of the church down the ages. Mennonite scholar Darren Belusa comments, the creational covenant pattern of marriage is a consensus doctrine of the church Catholic. whatever other social arrangements have been involved, until the present generation, all Christians everywhere, have believed, and every branch of the Christian tradition has taught that marriage is a man, woman, monogamy. So not only, if you vote for this, are you demanding we detach from the teaching of Jesus and the church Catholic, you'll also be buying into a long tradition of anti-Semitic readings of the Bible. You know the ones I know. Nasty Jewish law, loving inclusive Jesus. Thank goodness we've got the second and not the first. Entirely contrary to the views of the early church, who radically adopted this Jewish ethic, and that was key to the liberation of women and the protection of children. You just have to look at the numbers. Leading biblical scholar of a previous generation, E.P. Sanders notes, homosexual activity was a subject on which there was a severe clash, not just today, but between Greek or Roman and Jewish views. Christianity which accepted many aspects of Greek or Roman culture, in this case accepted the Jewish view totally. Paul 2 in Romans 1 articulates a standard Jewish critique of pagan approaches to sex. Bill Loder, an expert on this, and someone who'd vote for your motion notes, if Paul knew of homosexual orientation like other Jews, he would have rejected them out of hand under the influence of the Jewish creation tradition, which declares human beings, and female. And you're asking to separate us not just from Jesus, not just from Judaism, not just from the Church Catholic, but from Christianity today worldwide. Justin Bardi, primate of South Sudan, who leads, represents 75% of the Anglican Communion, says this. What's being proposed is in clear contravention of God's word. It will lead to fragmentation of the Anglican communion. Perhaps he's wrong. Perhaps it's time for a new colonialism, where we enlightened ones in the West with our gender identity politics should tell African and Asian Christians what to believe. Why not? We've done it before. But what is the Church of England in the first place? It's not something there to keep up with society, according to canon law. The church is one whose doctrine and teaching is grounded in the Holy Scriptures and in the ancient teachings of the ancient fathers and the councils, in the 39 articles of religion, the Book of Common Prayer, and the ordinal. All these things affirm marriage as between one man and one woman. So vote for this motion and you're going to have to scrap the lot. As Luke Timothy Johnson, Catholic liberal scholar says, the task demands some intellectual honesty. It's important to state that we do clearly reject the straightforward commands of scripture and appeal, appeal instead to another authority. So, ladies and gentlemen, do vote for this motion. Do vote for this motion. If you're happy to detach the church in this land from the church Catholic, from its Jewish roots, from the church worldwide, and from its own historic identity. Not only that, you'll also be voting for a church that will divide and decline and quickly disappear. Every Western denomination that has supported this motion has seen decline accelerate. Just look at the Methodists. Look around the world at Western Anglican churches. And you'll be voting for a church which does not engage with young people. 19 of the largest Anglican churches attracting young people, 19 out of the top 20 actually hold the historic view of marriage. More than 70% of young people who attend churches across the Church of England, attend churches who hold on to this historic view. In my city, there are a number of large growing churches, attracting students and young people. The leadership of every single one of those would oppose this motion, and I think the same is true in this city as well. And in voting for this, if you vote for this motion, you are as a non-religious group assuming that secular authority can determine religious belief. You won't be alone in that. It was true in Nazi Germany. It was true in the Soviet Union. And it's true today in China and Iran and North Korea. So vote for this motion. Perhaps it is time to dismantle the Church of England as it has existed since the 16th century. Perhaps it is time to tell Christians in African Asia to get with the program. Perhaps it is time to detach the church from its own history from the views of the Church Catholic and worldwide. Perhaps our view of natural justice, demands that we separate ourselves from the teaching of Jesus and Paul and all the scriptures, and declare historic Jewish belief oppressive. Perhaps it's the time to say this to other religions too. Anyone want to go and talk to the Muslims about this? If you believe, if, so if you want the state to tell religious people what they can believe, please, vote for this motion. If you believe it's time for all these things, by all means do, but please do it with your eyes open, knowing exactly what it involves. Thank you.
