 Well, I think I'll stay standing if it's okay with you guys. It's okay with the cameraman. I was just saying, I gather that last Monday you had Anthony Joshua here. So that's got to be the tallest two consecutive speakers you've ever had at Beauforts over six foot six. He might just be in better shape than me. I met him at Sheffield at a gym in 2013 and normally me being me. As you see I've got quite a good pair of shoulders on me. I try and outlift anyone I can, I took one look at what he was shifting and went, you win. Anyway, it's lovely to see you all here. I'm a bit in awe of being invited here. in 1983 I came up to do mathematics at Exeter College in 1986 I got my third which keep quiet about I did spend rather time on the sports pitch and I'm working out that the only time I've been here was in 1985 where I played snooker upstairs against my good friend dermot Russell which shows something I couldn't remember how to find my way here but once I was here I knew the snooker table was straight up there So perhaps that sums up the kind of memory I've got. And I've slightly had a lost what to do. And often I get an open thing of just speak whatever you will. But I almost don't know what to say here because if you'd have put money on the class of 83 from Exeter College Oxford, who's the one who's going to be arguing the most famous in 2022, you wouldn't have bet on me. We won a BAFTA yesterday. I didn't even know what a BAFTA was. All these actors and theatrical people, it's their life work. They were like crying with joy at winning. And they handed me and I go, yeah, that's nice. It's nice and heavy. Clearly, lead would have a bit of gold painted. Oh, thanks very much, cheers. But I guess we're just wired up differently. On the other hand, my team were lucky enough to win only Connect in 2009. And we won it when it was quite early. So it was a bit like winning the Olympics in the, early days where it was a lot easy to do but it doesn't matter we won and I'm far prouder of that and I'm in this slightly weird position because on one hand I got measured by ITV I've got an IQ of 151 so I just scrape into the genius category but the three categories I was well into the the top percentile on and you can tell how bad a mathematician on I still can't work out with the top percentiles the 90s the 99th percentile, or the 100 percent are. Perhaps someone who's a statistician can tell. Either way, I'm in the top percent, and I'm in the top 1 percent, the top 1 percent in three areas. One is mental calculations. Yay! Kind of mistake I made. I did maths because I was really good with numbers, which I should have realized when I came here. We don't do numbers here at Oxford. The second one was neural processing speed, which again was so useful for the chase. Literally, I've got the brains of a fighter pilot. I just haven't got the body of one. I mean, it's great because I still can, things like the sports pitch, you're able to react and your brain can do make up for what your body can't do, so I can work out what I should do, I just haven't got skills to do it. And the third one that's also the top centre was memory, which was until 2009, virtually worthless. And then who knew how many people can say that the job they were born to do, try again sorry it's the teacher in me if I pick on you it's nothing person which is force of habit if I start treating you like it you're year 11 class in a wet Wednesday afternoon I'm afraid years of training anyway so memory's my thing and who knew that the job I was born to do that literally you couldn't have created a job that fitted my personality and skills at me it didn't exist to 2009 until I was 43 years old And you think of all the thing now for the undergrad, quite a few of you are planning what you're going to do with your life. Some of you lucky people know it may know exactly what you're going to do. Others you may not have a clue. And the slightly scary thing about life is how it changes without you knowing it. There's some lucky people you know, I'm going to be a doctor, I'm going to be a lawyer, I'm going to be a computer scientist. You know exactly you're going to do, you focus on. Others are going, still don't quite know where I want to wind up. That's why perhaps so many people end up in a job like HR. I'm not sure anybody plans to be in HR. They just end up in them. We'd know, I'd be disrespectful to them. And I have a little theory that having spent a very bit time in education, I think slightly backwards to most people. I don't think that education opens doors. What I think is that a lack of education shuts them. So take a case in point. I'm not a doctor. but I could have been if I wanted to. I did train as a lawyer, found it quite easy. Sorry, lawyers. I wasn't doing it at Oxford, I was doing it another place and soon realised that, I'm sorry, those people who claim all university the same are talking out of their backsides. Because it was so damn easy. But I thought it wasn't the right personality for me, but it was doable. There's so many other jobs I could have done if I had the interest or inclination. Whereas, you know, it's the hardest thing as a teacher when you're speaking to a kid in the sick form and they're trying to do their maths and they want to be a doctor or dentist and the problem is you're going sorry you just can't do it you don't want to be negative but maths is a subject that's talent based and unfortunately while I reckon you can train just about anyone up to a certain level that at the moment I would have said with maths for a level and beyond if you can't do algebra it's going to be tough so what do in that situation with someone desperately wants to be in that subject or that area but can't do it. I mean, the only thing I wish I told us to have at 18 is, Mark, you may be built like an England rugby international, but you are not blessed with anything like fast twitch muscles. You're bulletproof, but you're never going to be fast enough. So forget about the sport, just concentrate on your brain because that's a quite good bit. Anyway, that's my little speech. I'll whitter on forever because this is the problem being an ex-teacher. We can whitter on on anything. You know, if they ever let me on, what was it, just a minute, I win every time. I'm sorry, Paul Sitter, you may be a champion that your ass is mine if you face me. So I'll go straight to the QA as well. I'll sit down now and try and be nice thing. I've only got one question I won't answer, and that's how much I'm on, because I'll tell you the answer is that what you should give in this scenario, none of your damn business. Thank you very much for that address. I thought it was very interesting and amusing. I suppose we'll start at the beginning. I mean, as you said, most people don't wake up as a seven-year-old and think, I'm going to be a professional quizzer. Were you interested in general knowledge in quizzes as a child? And if not, when did it sort of start to hit you? This was something you could make money from and then do more seriously? The answer is yes. So from an early age, again, it's a difference in background. My boy's five years old and he lives on his tablet, watching YouTube kids. and stuff like that. So the idea of waiting for a television show is anathema to him. He just dials it up and watches what he wants to do. I grew up in the 70s where we had free channels and you got what you were given. And they weren't even on that long. I think it was something like 4pm till 12pm and occasionally during the school holiday they had for kids. So you got what you've given. But from an early age, I liked watching Mastermind and University challenge and hey I'm seven eight years old I'm not going to get many right but I got the odd ones right and I have this theory that in any area of human activity it divides into free sort of competences the is it Malcolm Sitwell sit well is 10,000 hours of experience apologies I misquoted you may notice my memory sort of works it's fuzzy I don't short my colleague Sean remembers exact dates he'll go oh it's uh Roger Banner to 6th of May 1954. I mean I've run there enough on the track when I was here but I'm going, I knew it was May 1954 but I didn't know the exact date. So that's what, but I'm lucky to have what I call a sticky memory and it's that ability to sort of remember lots of things. So as I'm walking up here I'm going, oh hang on there's the theatre, hang on, I was working in 1986 cameo were a band there because I remember walking past it. I've seen my good friend James Haskell, the ex-Walsp, the Flaguerre, he's doing the good, the bad and the rugby next week. So you clock these little things and you find, and I'm going 22nd of May 2022 because that's the way my mind works. I've got flaws. The exact opposite. We've just been upstairs in the, was it McMillan room? No. The Gladstone room. I could tell you where the schematics were, where the table were, wherever. You asked me what the colour scheme is. I couldn't tell you. I'm not colour blind. It just doesn't register. Poor colour perception. So it's just as well I didn't want to be an interior decorator. Would have been the world's worst. But this sticky memory means I am that annoying person who didn't do revision for A-levels because I didn't need to. I remembered it the first time round. I wasn't great, but it's a lot easier when you don't have to bother revising something. And it's a gift that I guess I've trained over the years. So when I'm in London, going on the tubes and whatever, I'm always looking around at what the new films are of theatrical productions. And almost without trying, I remember, oh, someone so's in that film and whatever. And so you better drag it back. The one thing I've got disturbingly good for a straight man is on ladies' fashion. Because my lovely wife does like the high-end brands. And when we've been to like Fifth Avenue in New York or whatever, and she's heading around, I'm starting going, uh-oh. now know to dread the sight of a Louis Vuitton site thing or whatever. I'm still in shock from a few years ago. I, you know, as you love your wife, you buy her a nice pair of Christian Lebutons and apparently they're being seen in not for walking. I'm a bloke. For me, shoes you wear to walk, you know. But we went to a nice showbiz party and at the end of it, she's absolutely crippled. So she's sort of taking them off as we're walking back in the hotel and she turns around and whispers to me the words that still fill me with dread. Don't worry, darling, my next pair will have a shorter heel. I'm still a teacher. I still think, how much? So, yeah, it's, but that, the slight discouraging, but that's why that kind of ability to just drag stuff. Of all the professional quizzes, I'm the glorious amateur, the gentleman player. I'm lucky. It comes naturally. It's not even training. My colleagues like Paul Sinner works so hard. Other people in the egg gets like CD. The hours they put in and it works. They get brilliant. And then I just come along like, oh yeah, I remember reading that. So it's a gift. It was a worthless gift that suddenly thanked, Praise BITV became valuable. Was there a moment then when you sort of started doing quiz competitions in the early noughties, like he was being a millionaire, that it started from going, okay, this is quite a fun way to earn a bit of extra cash to, I want to... Actually, it was here. In about 85-86, I took Parker in the internal Oxford one. We made the semi-final where we got frashed by Lady Margaret Hall, I believe. And Stephen Pearson was their team captain, who's now like the Sir Alex Ferguson, the challenge. He's the librarian at Manchester University. and he's the one who trains their team every year and they make the semi-final wrap for every year. And amongst their team and amongst people I judge, we rate him possibly the best non-quizzer we've ever seen, a young Michael Gove. I'm not going to comment about his politics, but the guy is a natural quizer. And if I ever saw him on a quiz show, I'd be going, brace yourselves, guys, this guy, what he is interested in, he will know it. He's like me, a sticky memory. It's a gift. And one of the reason I said it was 86 was, tribal pursuit started coming around then. Now, I've got my third, so I'm not the brightest cookie. I know everyone says Oxford, they're the dumbest, but in my group of eight, yeah, I was eight out of eight for the extreme mathematicians. To be fair, five was a millionaires now, so I'm judging myself with a good company. But I noticed, they've all that, yeah, yeah, you're not very bright, but when it came to a tribal pursuit, they'd only play me three or four-hand, didn't I? Oh, hang on, I've clearly got some skills here. Then after I left Oxford, I went to Butlins, and there was a, you know these old quiz machines, there was an old one called Give Us a Break, which guaranteed £10 from a 20-piece steak if you've got 18 questions, right. With my kind of memory, and plus the ability to look up the wrong answers, soon was getting 18 out of 18 every time. They were my personal piggy bank, paid for every car up until recently. So who knew? But it was a bit of fun. So, yeah, I was lucky. I found what I was born to do. Some people are unlucky enough not to do it. But you never know where it's going to be, what it is that you do, which either gives you tremendous satisfaction or make a living out of it. Do you still find time to quiz for fun outside of your job? Well, I gather you're dragging me into one tonight, and I love quizzes, to be fair. The biggest problem now is I still love quizzes, but I'm, you know, I've got to get a kid. kid and suddenly your free time drops a little bit so now it's like you know I've been arranged this and going back tomorrow Wednesday and Thursday night I'm looking after him because it's the wife's turn to go out with her friends so I love doing it but you just haven't got the free time you used to but so love the good news I thought people would never let me into a quiz more like the other way around they invite you in and when they get one right that I don't know and it will happen boy do they live out on it you just go I I was said as me as a pro quiz a though, it's different to most people. Most people try to be really good and get a load of questions right. As a pro, I try and avoid getting them wrong, so it's all about working on weaknesses. So if we get a round of quizzes, I try and get eight out of ten or nine out of ten on every round. I don't try and give away a soft question, so I hopefully, for example, quiz literature. Every person is probably read more books than me, but I know the facts that get asked about quiz literature. So the largest part Hamlet, the largest part by a non-titled character, Iago, you know, Dickens' last work, The Mystery of Edwin Drew, all that kind of stuff. I think right, is that right? Yeah. So I know the kind of questions that come up time after time after time, and hopefully I get them right. Sometimes I don't, but it's all about trying not to give the soft questions away. I'll tell you now, we've had two pro quizzes on British telly they both coming up to 2,000 episodes, Us and Eggheads. By any standards, that's amazing longevity for a style of TV. I could just about guarantee there will be other such things in the future. I don't know when, I don't know where. My guess is Channel 4, because it's got a hefty youth component, will want younger professional quizzes. So they will be looking. We as ITV, I know they've looked over a thousand people at various points to see could you be a future chaser? The biggest problems they meet so many people who are great on mastermind, great on university challenge but they have little weaknesses and you go well that's the problem it's going to cost us money or unfortunately the it's fair to say the top one under quiz in the country there's definitely a heavy number of them on the spectrum I mean I don't think I'm on the spectrum but I'm really close to it and the be honest that's what get honesty is a surprise factor in TV and politics you know that that is that ability to focus on one specific thing to be you're more interested in facts and people because I used to sum up my life when I was single man is I could tell you that the capital of Estonia was telling but what's it mean when that girl's giving me that funny little smile and I'd be going know what you're going don't know what you're not of. Well, the reason to say that is there will be opportunities. And TV has a big problem in the world of quiz. The vast number of applicants to just about every quiz shows are white middle-aged straight men. So by definition, TV has a duty to be representative. So the further you are away from that demographic, the better chance you've got going on. Simple fact, six out of seven applicants to every quiz show are male. So if you want a 50, 50, male-female split, you do the math. You're six times more likely to get on if you're female. So, if you're young, female, visibly ethnic minority or alternative sexual orientation, you've got a much better chance of getting on because TV is wonderful in that regard. I don't know if it's the most gay-friendly industry out there, but it must be pretty close. You just don't ask, but that's the joy of TV. So the reason I mention it here is, it's more like pro wrestling than perhaps I should care to admit in that it's not just about it's not about we ever throw us up damn never ever but any professional wrestler will say they see people who've got all the technical skills and they say yeah but have you got personality can you get the crowd to love you and ideally a pro quizer needs both that they can answer questions and there's something about and make people want to watch them or want to throw things at them but it doesn't just as good Doesn't look if I'm going on any quiz shows any time soon then. Do you have any particular weaknesses other than the ability to read that strange smile from a woman that you could share with us? Oh yeah, I've got certain areas that I've not, I've mentioned literature, it's not my strength. It's ironic as my literature has got better. Areas of real strength, like sport and science have actually got a bit worse because they don't work on them anymore, I don't need to. I've got a secret strength, which when I was playing as a, as a, as a bit worse, I've got a bit worse. playing as an amateur, it's not obvious from my CV and background being a maths teacher and a sports as PE teacher. I'm actually really into history. So I did cheat when I asked me on quiz shows, what are you weak on? I'd always say history. A number of times it came up. I'm not daft. Yeah, the one thing I'm definitely, and I deliberately leave it as a weakness, is so popperous. And arrogant statement number 57 of the evening. Superman. needs kryptonite. Bradley loves it when there's a question come up about soap operas because he knows I don't know it. The audience don't know I don't know it. All the celebrities know I don't know it so they're just waiting there. But actually my wife watches East Enders a bit so I have it on in the background what so I kind of again that sticky memory you sort of absorb it when you're not looking and also if my job depended on it I'd close that weakness in a couple of weeks but there I'm quite deliberately giving him something almost like you're deliberately giving them dare I say I'm obviously older than you the what was it the death star with the the weakness if it had been me as grandmoth Tarkin I'd go yeah leave that in there but we're sickly building a metal grill behind it there so there was the time they go it's a trap um you sort of briefly touched on this when you're talking about only connect earlier but what is your quizzing highlights of your career so far it be winning only connect? Yeah, that was great as a team one. I almost didn't get the gig as a chaser because I hadn't won big TV shows. But it was very hard to get on TV quiz shows because producers want fair matches, which is understandable. And if you show what you can do, they're then going, we're not letting him on. He'll murder the opposition. Because I actually had with the first producer, Sue Allison, they're saying, well, we're not sure you've never won anything. And I said, well, she presented about, I produced about a dozen shows. I said, would you have ever let me on those shows? And she went, oh, no, you're far too good. Tadda! So, yeah, TV, I mean, well, when I got 26 in a row right on the chase, obviously that was because no one's ever done it before since I don't have been able. Well, I'm good, I'm very good. But actually, the biggest one is actually the big wins in America because probably any American or non-British people who will realize how much, pop culture changes without you realising it when you go, well. So having to do really well in America, the best compliment I got paid was at the end of the first series was the host, Brooke Burns, brilliant host. She turned around and asked me, so Mark, how many times have you been to America? And I went, this was my first time. And they were like, because that was the question I was dreading all through the interviews where, yeah, I could do this stuff in America, but I've never actually been here before. And you imagine trying to study for a different country when you're not there. So any time I won in America, it was great fun. One of the questions I have down here actually is sort of related to that. What differences do you notice in quiz competitions across the world? So you obviously do chase Australia now as well. Are there discernible differences across the world in the approach to quizzing and the sort of structure of the... Yes. Britain is the Everyman Show. We're very proud of the fact we've had 18-year-olds I think we've had a 90-year-old and we've certainly been in the 80s. And it's great because you make assumptions about people and every once in a while, you're surprised when you've got the 21-year-old nurse who actually has got the gift and no, obviously, serious quiz, I think one time we had the lady who was about mid-70s and she hammered out, like we're going, where did that come from? So it's really nice we see someone, we make judgments, everybody does. And most time it's right. Every once in a while you get it wrong. I go, hello. So we're the Everyman Show. Australia is pretty similar, but because they don't pay expenses, if we're filming in Melbourne, it tends to be people in Melbourne and surrounding area, if we're in Sydney, so it's got a slightly more smaller base. So it's, America at the exact opposite, they've got a bit of a Logan's run attitude. They don't let too many people on much above in the 40, well in the 40, certainly. So they're younger, we get so many people of Jeopardy champions, which one end is great because you're thinking, these guys have got a bit of a rep, you know, they're quite good, they study. At the same time, I'm going, okay, bring it on. This is why I'm the best person I ever played on the GSM version of the chase was a guy called James Holzhauer, who turned out, they'd warned me before, and this is the highest rated candidate we ever had, and he walloped me, no argument. But I loved it because they also gave him two equally good teammates, and it took about an overdose, it was like going, Okay, normally there's one good player and two people who are there for the experience. All three were really good. They beat me 269 and I'm smiling as I walk off and they went, how can you be like that? And I said, because you've just asset stripped free teams and put all their star players together. The next two teams will be rubbish, and they were. But the Americans put them on. And funny, this guy James Haltai mentioned, I put a tweet after, I would say, without doubt the best contestant I've ever faced anywhere. And then a couple of years ago, he was the guy who won 32 straight games, won several million dollars and has set so many records on Jeopardy. And was one of my colleagues on the Chase ABC and a brilliant young man. Is there a game show anywhere in the world that you most want to do that you haven't been able to? Tipping point. Done tipping point, won that. But it's probably the strange ones. I'd have loved to have done, well, it's quite annoying. You know, Mastermind, the one thing I will say is very controversial. I don't believe they get away with what they do because the producers effectively decide which contestants get which questions and you're on their honor that they'll try their best to make it as level as possible. And you think about Mastermind, other shows you can disrupt or interfere with the contestants and get points off the thing. Mastermind, effectively, it's four people. people each doing a VEBA exam, you know, oral exam. So if they're the ones getting the easy questions, there's nothing you can do about it. It's the one thing I am a bit bitter about. I was asked by the Animal Health Trust to go on it, and they said the fees £4,000, but we give it direct to the charity. And I thought, great, no, happy to do that. Dear old BBC said, no, you're not allowed on, and I'm going, fair enough, but I'm going, you just cost my charity four grand, thanks for that. The one I'd love to go on and Channel 4 invited me then uninvited me. I don't know why it was Crystal Mays. Just it looks so much fun. Do you have a favourite comedic moment from any of the shows, any sort of wrong answers or? Well, it's more like cringing when you, it sounds silly but when you're going at top speed, your mouth is disengaged from your brain sometimes and you're not stopping to check, you're just firing out the first dance. it comes in the head. So I've even got a maths question wrong because I didn't listen to it. By far the most common mistake I made, and I as a teacher, I'm always saying, RTFQ, read the full question. Well, I didn't learn it as full at school. Yeah. I'm well trained now. I know I could get away with swearing, but every time I see a camera, I thought, I've already been told my agent said there are certain words you can't use it and you can't use the F word, the MF word and definitely not the C word. But, then where's going to I've lost my frame to the funniest moment Oh, funniest moment Yeah, so you So things like, How many Teletub is like, Five, what the You know, as I'm saying it, I'm going, It's almost like there's an alien You had your brain going. And the one, the first time we ever did Minus Offers and one of the best shows I've ever been with and the first one to get three million viewers. They scored 25. I'm absolutely charging. So I've got about 10 right in a row in 30 odd seconds. flying with about two seconds ago and he won to win. How many legs does her? And at which point I'm just going four as I hear Bradley go flee. So I go no six note. Beep. Unfortunately they edited it out. So my FUCK got beautifully starbursted out. Good work with the editors there. But it was great fun. I've never seen anything like because they took a negative offer and the team, the seat four and the other three turned on him. They were on my side. It's brilliant. Do you watch back your performances on game shows? Again, I haven't got time. I used to what time because partly eager, but also see what did I do, which I think worked and what didn't do. And I'm genuinely, well, being the most experienced chasing in the world, I've been obviously America and Australia, I'm all saying to the new guys and stuff and girls, if you can stand it, look at what you did and think, do I like that or are you cringing when you see it? Because if you're cringing, either make it part of your act or dump it fast. It's a TV forgive will forgive just about anything except being boring. And it sounds a terrible statement to make, but it is, so many people are, and they say, I'm a better question than you when I go, I know you are. So it says, how come you've got the gig? And they haven't. And it's like trying to explain the colour blue. I'm sort of going, one of them is like a world champion. But even his tone of voice is a flat monotone all the time. You try and listen to him for 30 seconds and you can't and you go, you just see he's never going to understand it. So the good news is if any of you have got characterization, personality, you're a natural performer and you can make yourself into a half-decent quizer, there's going to be a job out there. We've got a simple test for a finger chaser and it's 20 questions right in two minutes. If you get 20 questions right in two minutes, you're probably not going to cost too much money, so welcome aboard. One of my colleagues is occasionally when they're having a bad run is down at 18, and then the money starts piling up. We had a lady who she's on telly a bit. I won't give real name. She's very bright, but when we test out, she was averaging about 16 or 17. And we wanted her desperately beyond the show, but the producers just went, she'll cost us too much money. I will say this, and it's a simple statement of fact. I've been asked on both Britain, or all of Britain, American Australia, can I find a female quizer who can play like Anne or Jenny and looks like she could be on Love Island? I call that Project Unicorn. I'm not saying there aren't out there, but what I'm saying is guys, in the Americans, they've been running quizzes for 60 years. I said, are you telling me if you found someone like that you wouldn't have signed her up before she's left the studios? Just say it's TV, it's a very visual medium. I'm lucky, I'll stand up to make the point. Normally, I got thrown off shows because when your host is being like, like most actors about five foot seven or eight, and would a bit of a complex about their height. I stand next to them, we're not having him on here. Suddenly though, for being a chaser, when I went along to the audition, I've wearing my big Soviet army-style great coat. I come ducking in under the door, it's flailing behind me like Superman's cape. The first producer, the one who hired me, Sue Allison, said, I didn't know what the chaser was gonna look like, and then you walked in. So, other people turned up wearing suits all their best knitwear and personality in Mac and then wonder well he didn't get a job. Well, I say Pat Gibson, who's now an egg-goat, world champion. He turned round after the interview, said, well, I got everything right. I don't know what more I could have done. And I'm going, you just don't get it, mate. You don't put any personality out. He's a lovely guy, but he's a natural introverts. Well, no, I'll tell you now, if you want to go on any quiz show, any quiz show, and I include University Challenge, Mastermind, all the serious ones, it's more important to have a funny story about yourself than you'll score. It doesn't have to be true. We put it the thing, it's a, I mean I always love it when the people tell little fibs to get on the show. There was a guy once he got, he's a very good player, Mastermind Semi-Finalist, his team won and he told everyone, oh if I win I'm donating my share to the youth rugby section of my club. And so he's a very good. and then the um the our handlers are looking after the researchers said oh i bet you rugby clubs really pleased about a quarter of 40 000 pounds so that's 10 000 i think you're doing the mess and he just went uh no i've just left the wife and i need it to shack up with the girlfriend and they and you could see they they were fury that how dare we lie to us and i'm going you muppets you're not under oath he told the story to go on it's they call it auditions with a good reason. It's all about presenting yourself. Some people do it really well. If you're lucky to be attractive of either sex, use it. Dress well, have a funny story. It is an audition. You need to stand out. It's far more important. When they record you, two to three minutes, can they remember you? Do they stand out? They often don't care about your score. They only care about your score when it comes to putting the team together. This is why people sometimes know, How come there's nearly always that, well, later in seek for the chase, at least half the time, the running order goes, the quiet but decent one, the strong one, the pretty one of either sex, and the nutter. And it's quite deliberate. They want the person who thinks got the biggest personality to be in the game the longest, and the one who's going to have the most flexibility of options in seat four. Seat free, look more times than not, and you will see it someone in the 20s or 30s who the sun or the star are going to drool over when they do their clickbait fees. You might think that's incredibly cynical and sexism. It's both sexes. It's TV. They do anything to get the headlines. Just a couple of questions from me before we open up to the audience. You may notice I do like talking. I'll do a couple of... I'm here until you guys get bored. A couple of the more casual questions then. If you're a comment, I'm a couple of the more casual questions then. If you're a testant on the chase, which one of your colleagues would you most want to face, and least want to face? Unfortunately, that's working, other way. Sean or Darrow, I'm privileged to know what our internal testing is like, and there's a clear pecking order, and it's, Paul is brilliant, very closely behind him is me who occasionally beat, it depends, the older the questions, the better I do, then it's Jenny and then it's Anne but we're all really close together Jenny is the best of us being the youngest at the up-to-date stuff and if time wasn't a factor she'd be number one or two because she's brilliant she's miserable time let's just say there's a tail off after that and leave it at that it's a I wouldn't well my colleague Sean I'll make the point of thing he's got an IQ of 96 and yet he's a barrister he's hoping to get silk Can you imagine what it must have been like trying to become a barrister as a black man in the 1980s and 90s? I don't even want to know how much trouble, how much discrimination he base. Unbelievable drive and commitment. If I'd have had his drive and commitment, I'd have been a headmaster by 35. So he's such a hard worker. But, and he's still the best quiz, well, the best quiz in the world on the 20th century. The problem is the 21st century has passed him by. He doesn't own a computer, we think, and the rest of us are all studying all the time. And unfortunately, if any of you are neurobiologists or whatever, I was told there's two different types of long-term memory. Crystal and fluid. Crystal is your hard facts, which starts going in your mid-60s. So who was president, he's still as good as anyone at. But the fluid one, which is comparing, contrasting and calculating, you may notice anything that involves him having. to calculate something or compare he's in trouble because he's a 61 year old man and unfortunately hey I'm 56 I can feel my brain slowed down it's just merely very good rather than Newman and so people sometimes think how can he not get this and plus he doesn't watch tellies so when they ask what color are most of the characters in the Simpsons their skins he doesn't have a clue and everyone's going oh come on but he'll watch TV he'll watch football but he doesn't So we've all got strengths and weaknesses. I wouldn't like to face the ladies because their strengths are not mine. Whereas Paul, plus the thing I know about Paul is Paul is brilliant, and I'd play the man, not the ball, I'd wind him up. That's the value of lifetime of sport. You could just sort, you know, the little bit of, as the Australians would call it, it's not sledging, it's the fine art of mental destruction. So you start, oh, how's the tremor coming here, Paul or whatever? It might sound cruel, but I'll take any, you may notice I'd do it with a contestant, a little bit. The fine line between abuse and just trying to put them off a little bit. So, you know, the evil laugh is designed to say, you know I know this, and I know you don't. I'm glad I've been spared of that. And sometimes I bluff just to really throw them. Have you ever been asked, and this is perhaps a gap in my research for this, but to represent Exeter College in the Celebrity University Challenge? No, and I wish they would. Do you that be fair? Yes. But it's BBC. It's... Well, sometimes, like I said, Michael Goevers is brilliant. They, you know, they invite all kinds of the great and eminent and the good. And sometimes I feel like going, well, I'm just eminent in a particular field. To be fair, I'm an all-rounder. I'm probably going to get beaten by most of these guys on their specialist subjects. But I know a little bit about everything. I'd love to be invited. But somehow, I don't think they are. Is it not organised by the colleges then? Is it organised by the BBC? I have no idea. A final question from me. I promise I'd ask one of our security staff that I'd ask. Yeah, security people like me. I think I'm one of them. I've done my share of doorwork. Do penguins have knees? Ooh, you evil so-and-so. Let's think. My instinct is to say yes. I know the weird one, as you've learned strange one, that elephants are the only mammals with four knees, even the other big creatures, their front limbs are still elbows rather than knees by devine. Whereas elephants, because of the extra, they are actual knee, that's what I was told. I'm willing to, that's the problem, you learn stuff and then afterwards, is that really true or not? But I guess yes. I don't know what the correct answer is. Because logically otherwise, well, logically, otherwise, legs are pretty damn useless if you can't bend and get any spring out of them. Anyway, that would be my... but I'm willing to be corrected. I don't see penguins springing anywhere. Well, they fly and they swim and they've got a little spring. Might not be much flex, but you'd don't think you've only got to bend your knee a little bit to get a surprising amount of power. I suppose, I suppose. No, right now it's time for audience questions. So if you have a question, please raise your hand or your membership card. I will point to you and then one of our SECIs will bring you a microphone. Please don't start speaking until the microphone gets to you. So any member wish to ask a question, please raise your hand, the member in the front row. Right, quickly, We're going to make this guy run. Hello. Hi there. What does your revision look like? How do you prepare? If there's a producer listening, it's 70 hours a week of hard work. If they're not listening, it's about 10. But before anyone says it, let me put in perspective. Recently just watched the Marvel Cinematic Universe and some of those spin-offs again. That's work. That's revision. Downton Avenue, Abbey, that's definitely reasoning. We've been told quite clearly that the big Netflix shows we're going to get asked on. So I haven't got around a squid game yet. The Queen's Gambit I have, I've done the Umbrella Academy. That's all work. When I've got my feet up on a Saturday watching the sport, it's work. When I'm, by definitely, I've always, I roughly speaking, very roughly grade knowledge into five categories. one, two, three, four, five. With one being, it's embarrassing, but don't get that right. So the capital of France is Paris, that sort of thing. Like I said, got five, or I hope by eight or nine, he's got them right. Level two, you'd expect most teams to get that right. Maybe the odd person doesn't know it, but it's a fairly standard one. Level three is starting to get to half the teams might not get this. So something like a 19th century, or 20th century, US Prime Minister, sorry UK Prime Minister who isn't Margaret Fatcher or Winston Churchill. Level four. Got five of them here. Yeah, I know. I've got to mention it there. Yeah, that's one of the questions. Just saying, was it the seven of them? Have we been there? Six of them so far, thank you. I was a contemporary of both Boris and David. I didn't move in their circles for some reason. The one thing I'm fairly confident is I think I've aged better than Boris have. But then he's had more kids than me, so that's it. So level four, you start to feel quite smug that you get it right and other people. And if they get it right, you're going, okay, it's a literal question, I know that's their strange. And level five is that are you kidding me question? What's that doing in a general knowledge question? And if you get it right, you're thinking, I got it right, but I'd never expect to be asked it. So my aim is almost like Grayne going, always when you're level one, two. So I mentioned some of those TV shows, the big shows in the last few years, Love Island, I hate to say know a little bit about them. So the hosts, maybe one or two of the winners, and generally the amount of tan they use, but that's about it. I've actually seen the Love Islanders being auditioned, and you're going, and they're in their outfit, and you're going, okay, I don't think there's a general knowledge element to their audition. Just a quick follow up for me, you mentioned your son then. Is he being trained to be a quiz at for a young age? I'll let him enjoy. life because who knows what he's bright. Obviously I've got my maths background. He's well ahead of his contemporaries. But I don't want to be that guy who hot heads, you know, hot houses their kid. At the same time, I keep winding up the producers to say is my plans to hang on until he's about 21, 22 and then retire so baby beast can take over. Well, he'll be my height. Genetics, it's a wonderful thing. Any of the members wishing to ask a question? The member in the green jumper. One sprint. What specific memorization techniques would you use to maximize the amount of information you take in? This is the problem because I'm the natural, I don't really do it. I just absorb it. I've seen the people who are Tony Bazan and their memory palaces. They clearly work and they're great, but I always wonder if it's a little bit like they work for people who don't have natural ability. Is it going to get in the way? I'll let you into a secret. I'm not great at memorising lines for Panto. I guess my brain's a bit like random access memory. I store things all over the place. Whereas obviously a script, you've got to have a precise flow and all. And if you're working with someone, you can't just leave them to hanging out to dry. You've got to hit exactly the right order to give them a chance. It's interesting, Kevin Ashman, the Egghead, who's by a lot of people's consent. as the greatest quiz player he's ever lived. The great quote about him is he's never met a museum he didn't like. It's phenomenal work rate. But it's interesting, a subject like horse racing, he's got no interest at all in it, and he says, so it just doesn't go in. And I'd agree with that. I'm lucky I'm interested in a lot of things, and if they are, I learn it. One observation, when I was a teacher, one of my pupils in special needs, and he was statemented for it, for it, statemented for extremely poor memory. He'd even been given a sort of tablet laptop to do his stuff on. And yet if I told him the date, he could tell me what the number one was that date, and he was right. There's nothing wrong with his memory. He just didn't care about the rest of school. So, you know, there's so many people out there, they say, I don't know anything. Then you get them on the subject they are interested, and they could bore for Britain on it. So everyone's got a phenomenal interest. I guess the key thing is have an interest, but that's easy said then. I've got to say Lowe's memory, they really do work. Just personally, I'm too lazy to do them. Other people will learn, for example, films. They don't bother learning the plot or the actors, but they always learn the directors because it's very quizzable. Whereas I'm the idiot who actually watches the film. As I say, I said, I'm probably the greatest expert on crap films in Britain because I'll actually watch all those one-star-rated sports movies, etc. these, et cetera, I said, because I like him. It's like, I know what I like. And they say, why aren't you watching? Everyone says this is an epic. And I'm just going, I'm still a peasant at art. Any of the questions? The member in the leather jacket on the front row. Hi, I actually have two questions. I hope that's OK. First one, we've heard a bit about some of the comedic moments on your time on the chase. Do you have an absolute. standout favourite moment overall and my second question is have you been asked to go on any like reality TV shows I'll answer the second one first I couldn't possibly comment that in no way shape or form am I gonna refer to a certain well-known ITV show that my best friend and the godmother to my son was on a few years ago to great success I am absolutely not making any comment whether I've been interviewed or invited on it other than the say my father was a master butcher and I'd make a damn good cannibal if they let me in there. So that's the second one. TV, they always say, don't tell anyone, don't tell anyone and go. And then the problem is I walk down the street and they go, people spot me, duh. And then the first one, absolutely, I was there when it happened. The back story was our main question writer, Luke Kelly, had found out for about a couple years of existence of a German skis. called Fanny Smeller. He tried for two years to get the producer to put the question in, and she said, we are not that kind of show. We don't do it. She relented. Last show of series three or four, and Anne was doing it, and I was there in the background thing, and when it did, and I know they've edited it, or maybe my memory slightly playing tricks, because when they read it, you could see almost like this ripple effect went round the crew or whatever as we started to get it and then Bradley got it and then Ang got and the Aussie guy who was on it didn't get it for quite a while and we for about it felt like for about 10 minutes Bradley did a masterclass of losing it but not quite and then sort of getting it back and then he started and then he went again and it was like and it's just a priceless thing of sheer mirth I fell off my chair with joy because I was in in Chaser's Corner, which if you're looking at Anne, in cricketing parlance, I was in about gully or third slip, so behind her into a right, but also, and you know you've got something funny when the crew can't stop laughing, which is one of the thing I've tried, if I get a, if I get a line in, especially in a, and the crew laugh, I think, yeah, it's a good one, you know, they're cynical professionals. So it's a, you feel you've done your job there or whatever. And it, it, it made half a million difference to our viewing figures and we went from a it did we went from a solid hit to a phenomenal and this is the best thing when we wind up i tv so remind us again how much advertising you've given the chase over the years and it's about 50p but we're the every day now we're the third or fourth biggest show on telly that night and we're normally behind emmerdale or corrie we're beating east enders every day of the week And considering we're run on about one-fifth of the budget, that's a bit embarrassing. And the lovely Richard Osmond once come up with a great line. And why more people don't take this seriously? He claimed one time it was true. Pointless celebrities had the same viewing figures as the X factor. It did help the point this was on just before strictly, but it still got the the same viewing figures and he made the point that said we did an entire series of 24 point of celebrities for the same money as one episode of X Factor and as Richard's a brilliant producer I can believe in on that I always say what's the big secret of the chase and the ads are simple we're cheap and don't knock it TV is broadcast TV if you study the viewing figures they're going down and down and down because your age group know there's alternatives to just sitting down and watching telly at the prescribed time. We're really lucky the chase so many pubs it's on between five and six. I know because I keep going in and there and I go, please let me not be on, please let me not, you know, sometimes they've noticed me, sometimes they don't. It says how much I go in the pubs, but it's nearly always for meals at five o'clock. And effectively the commercial television and the BBC thing, It's dying out. I was told that the median age of a BBC one viewer is 62. And that was a few years ago. Now it's probably more. So there's an obvious thing to say, what's going to happen in 10, 20 years, where the median age in the 70s? And plus, they're the ones who've been conditioned to pay the license fee year in year out, whatever. You might be the generation who go, not unreasonably, why the heap am I paying it? And before I'm having to go at BBC's expense, look at ITV's viewing. figures even 10, 15 years ago. The fact that we at five o'clock are getting three and half million viewers and we're one of the biggest shows on telly. In 2000, anything less than eight million, you'd have been cancelled from prime time telly. It's a problem all of mainstream broadcasting's got because you've got this YouTube, wonderful, I'll probably get 100,000 viewers from it or whatever. By the end, maybe even a million people like it or whatever. So I'm careful not saying anything too outrageous, like, yeah, I'm the best Jason of carrying all those bums. Oops, to be like. Well, if you're, the show you're alluding to in your first answer is what I thought it was. We had Roman Kemp come on Friday and I believe he placed third in that so you can ask him for some some tips. Oh, yeah, second generation it kind of helped. I met both. They're lovely. Any more questions? The member in the front row. What would you say is your most niche subject interest? Neat subject... Okay, this is not the ones, because obviously they know I like my sports, so I know my Aussie rules football, my sumo and stuff, because Channel 4 used to cover them both in the 80s and stuff. But the one weird thing is, and I loved history, and for some strange reason, I've got a pretty good knowledge of Japanese history. There used to be a role-playing game called Boshida in the early 80s when geek I was actually did. So I actually know probably way more than I should do about it. So they're always asking, sometimes they want to catch us out. And they ask us like, what was the name of the masterless warriors in feudal Japan? And they're shocked when I go, Ronin. And they're like, you're not expected to get that. And I go, well, for starters, have you never seen 47 Roanin? You know, on the... But the best one is that if you watch the show, you may not. notice, we get one right than Bradley's not expecting us to, his eyebrows go back. And that's always a good thing. When he goes, he was better. And I still remember the best one was because I, yeah, I know. And they asked me, what was it? Who had a, which Dutch DJ had a clubb it in the 2000s would? Was it, you don't know me or whatever if you, and I'm going, and I go, hang on, that's Armand Van Heldon, isn't it? And Bradley almost had a burst of blood. Don't ask me how, but I knew it. Well, the answer is I listened to things and it's played so much on a Friday, Saturday night, even I picked it up now. I am that idiot. When I go to all the nightclubs like Attic and stuff, I'm actually paying attention to a lot of the music going, perhaps I should know this if you guys are all, you know, getting down. So it's like now I'm going, now I know that Stacey's mum is by the Fountains of Wayne. And Stacey's mum has got it going on. So it's going to happen. And I'm waiting for one day that's going to come up and Bradley's going to go. how there. So this means surprise knowledge. So the ones they don't expect you to get. They always say that's why I'm the hardest one to set to because they know what Anne's. They say they don't but it's fairly obvious. Whenever Anne's in trouble, she tends to get nice, hard history questions. Paul gets 80s tennis and pop music. Sean is football and boxing. And me it's the weird one because they just don't know what I know. And like I said, it froze. because they expect you get it wrong and when you get it right it's like well that was damn I will cheerfully admit this because it's an open secret the celebs aren't quite as good as they think they are we give every celeb a pro form a piece of a four and it's more or less say tell us what you know and it's only fair because we've got to make a show where they've got a chance of winning it's a handicap if we beat them by minute every time it's a terrible show when it gets cancelled And we'd rather them get asked questions on what they know. What you don't see is the number of times they'll make a comment like, I've just been there, that's my favourite band. Oh, I know that author and you just go, and they still get it wrong, which is great. And the other thing they do to help the celebs are they pick the right chaser. So let me give an example. Jonathan Ross, very bright man, an acknowledged expert in certain cult areas of TV and film. He really likes his cult TV. He's very big into anime and manga. So they'll ask questions on that. So we'll get questions on The Walking Dead, which he follows, all the kind of shows we know he knows. He'll get asked him and he'll get him right. But the second bit is they then just make sure who he plays against. Now, they don't put Jonathan Ross up against Jenny who watches that stuff or me who watch that stuff, and it'll also get it right. They put him up against Sean, who doesn't watch television. Hey, our face are so popular stars and I'm going, I'm in trouble here, or someone who's a fashionista and I'm going. You could, it's interesting, Jenny, when she first started, did a bit of homework on the four contestants and just from their Wikipedia page, this is brilliant research, she found out, she did about 100 questions and five of them came up. So we can be sneaky as well as them. And it's a handicap show. The one thing I will happily boast about it. And as a good mathematician, I can prove this. I get tougher teams than everybody else. So if you have occasionally me doing the Mario Ballotelli and going, why me? And they openly say, Mark, you want to be the best? You've got to be the best. And there are times going, yeah, but can't I have the cannon fodder that some other people do? It's nice to win occasionally. I don't have time for one, maybe two more questions. I think I'm also going to the pub afterwards and I'm not drinking so I'd be like this all evening. The member in the salmon trousers. I'll try to do these next ones very quickly. On a related note, what would your special subject be? Clint Eastwood films or the Olympics, not the Simpsons it used to be. Or if I'm being sensible, a TV show that hasn't been many episodes off. So you can just black add is a brilliant. I've got the box set, watch them all the day. And I'll very quickly do this way if you want there. I've noticed a couple of times on Beat the Chasers when there's like two seconds left on your clock. You'll just buzz in and say cheese. Why is it always cheese? If you analyse over several thousand shows, what do you think is the most likely the answers to come up? And there are things like cheese, USA, pasta, four, you know, it's a country or a number or a food stuff. And once and what, sometimes it's going to be, it actually happens. a few years ago and I feel guilty afterwards but it was an example of perfect technique. I got two seconds ago so you've got no time. I heard one word longines or longines it's pronounced. I just went to Switzerland. It was the correct answer. I've utterly robbed them for the same time I'm thinking it was brilliant technique. When you're down to that level it's word association, word association you don't stop to to think because any answer is better than none and one day it will be right and you'll see them going this isn't fair but it's brilliant this is why vary so i now do four or pastor or USA but they've started to do it you've got three seconds ago you haven't got time to hear the old quote you've just got the first answer and sometimes it works finally i'll ask you one last question which we ask all of our speakers before we finish the event yeah um if you could in in two sentences give some advice to our members here and online, what would it be? Enjoy your life. Some of you know exactly where you're going to go. A lot of you won't and it's the little things the world has changed so much in the 34 years. We had no tallies, no computers. You're the generation it could be a nightmare or you could have fusion power, gene technology, stem and gel therapies and you're all living 100 plus. You don't know. Flexibility is everything. Ladies and please join me in thanking Mr. Mark Labatt.
