 Thank you. Thank you very much for that very warm welcome. Good evening. I'm very delighted to be here. Early in his brilliant study of the Russian Revolution a people's tragedy, The historian Orlando Fiji sets out an exchange of letters between Queen Victoria and her granddaughter, Princess Alexandra. The 22-year-old Alexandra had moved to Russia and was married to Sir Nicholas II. News reached Queen Victoria that the new Serena Alexandra was unpopular in the Russian court in St. Petersburg and had gained a reputation for coldness and Oter. Queen Victoria wrote to her grandchild with some advice. Quote, There is no harder craft than our craft of ruling. I have ruled for more than 50 years in my own country, which I have known since my childhood, and nevertheless, every day I think about what I need to do to retain and strengthen the love of my subjects. How much harder is your situation? You find yourself in a foreign country, a country which you do not know at all, where the customs and ways of thinking and the people themselves are completely alien to you, and nevertheless, it is your first duty to win their love and respect. Alexandra replied with an arrogance, which suggested that her reputation was well deserved. You are mistaken, my dear grandmamma, Russia is not England. Here we do not need to earn the love of the people. The Russian people revere their Tsars as divine beings, from whom all charity and fortune derive. As far as St. Petersburg society is concerned, that is something one may wholly disregard. The opinions of those who make up this society and their mocking have no significance whatsoever. Well, there can be no doubt which of them was proved right by later events. One of them has many lakes, waterfalls, railway and coach stations, parks and pubs both real and in TV soap operas, named after her, and one of them doesn't. This exchange of letters between Victoria and Alexandra has stayed with me as I've climbed the judicial ladder. Queen Victoria and her 50 years on the throne had learnt an important truth. Even if your position does not depend on being elected to office every few years, it may still be important as a public figure to earn and retain, if not the love, then at least the respect and accept of the general population. I and my fellow members of the judiciary are not elected to office. So how far does the acceptance of our role depend, how far should it depend, on our taking care to stay in tune with the thoughts and opinions of the general population? The thesis that I hope to develop in this talk is that the answer to this question can be considered on two levels. A theoretical level arising from the person arising from the position of the judges in our constitution and the importance of the separation of powers in a democratic country, but also at a practical level. Societies need judges that they can trust because people will always get into disputes about things. And when people do disagree, it's better for society that they have courts and judges to resolve those disputes peacefully. Otherwise, they are forced to take the law into their own hands. And when we talk about people taking the law into their own hands, what we really mean is that there is no law at all, other than that the strong and the powerful will prevail over the weak and the vulnerable. Let me look first at an area of a judge's workload where the judges are most closely involved in putting into effect the social morays of the times. That is when they are enforcing and implementing those mores, as expressed through the enactment of legislation that's been debated in Parliament. Legislation covers almost every aspect of our daily lives in both our work and our recreation. Some statutes deal with the most sensitive, moral and ethical issues that a society has to grapple with, such as the death penalty, human fertility and embryology, the balance between citizens' human rights and the rights of the community to be protected against violent attack. It's through changes in the law that you can chart the development of the ideology of a society. The gradual abolition of slavery in the early 19th century, the introduction of anti-discrimination laws in the later part of the 20th century, the availability of information from public bodies and the protection of personal data. A large part of the judicial caseload is devoted to determining and declaring the correct meaning of this legislation. legislation and since the 1970s the average number of pages per act passed by Parliament has written risen fourfold and the average number of clauses has more than doubled even with the highly skilled cadre of lawyers who work full-time in drafting the clauses that go into every bill situations arise in real life that were not foreseen and where it is not clear how the legislation is supposed to apply when judges are called upon to interpret an ambiguous section in an act of Parliament, they often describe what they are doing as trying to discern the will or intention of Parliament. This means that if one of the possible interpretations put forward by one of the parties in the case, if it leads to a result that appears to go against the purpose for which the legislation was enacted, the judges will reject that interpretation on the basis that it could not have been what Parliament intended. The court's task, therefore, within the permissible bounds of interpretation, is to give effect to Parliament's purpose. One way in which judges have sought to do this is in a greater readiness to step in to prevent people from taking advantage of the fact that there has been an obvious mistake in the drafting. The House of Lords held over 20 years ago that if the drafter of the legislation has inadvertently failed to give effect to the purpose, of a particular section in the statute, the courts can step in provided it's clear what Parliament would have said if they had said what they meant. Judges have also found a way of updating old legislation if it's clear that the words used then should now encompass a new situation that did not exist when the legislation was enacted. This is called the always speaking doctrine. It means that terms used in legislation are not frozen to the meaning at the date when the legislation was enacted, but can change as society and technology changes. For example, in 1880, the word telegraph, in the Telegraph Act 1869, was held by the court to include a telephone, even though the telephone had not been invented when the act was passed. Another example is a line of cases applying provisions in the Rent Acts that give rights to, quote, a member of the tenants' family. The decisions of judges as to who counts as a member of a tenant's family for this purpose have changed over the years to reflect changes in social attitudes. In 1950, the Court of Appeal held that, where a man and woman had lived together for many years without marrying, the tenant's partner was not a member of the tenant's family for this purpose. 25 years later, the Court of Appeal on similar facts reached a different view. Another 25 years on, the House of Lords held that a tenant's homosexual partner was a member of his family within the meaning of the equivalent provisions of the Rents Act 1997. As Lord Bingham put it in a well-known case, if Parliament however long ago passed an act applicable to dogs, it could not be properly interpreted to apply to cats, but it could properly be held to apply to animals which were not regarded as dogs when the act was passed, but are so regarded now. As Lord Bingham suggests, the always speaking doctrine can only go so far, however. Last year in a case, the Court of Appeal was asked to consider whether digital online editions of the Times and the Sunday Times fell within the term newspapers, so that they should, like paper newspapers, be zero rated for VAT. We decided that digital news, newspapers raised different issues that made them distinct from physical print newspapers, and the always speaking doctrine did not allow the court to extend the term newspapers to cover this new digital product. This issue was discussed by the great American jurist and US Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo in his lectures delivered in 1921 and published under the title The Nature of the Judicial Process. In his third lecture, he quotes a fellow jurist as saying this, it is the function of our courts to keep legal doctrines up to date with the morays of the public by continual restatement and by giving them continually new content. It is the necessity and duty of such legislation that gives to judicial office its highest honour, and no brave and honest judge shirks the duty or fears the peril. Judge Cardozo noted that there can be no assurance that judges will interpret the Morays of their day more wisely and truly than other men. But that, he said, was beside the point. The point is, rather, that this task of interpretation must be lodged somewhere, and the custom of the Constitution has lodged it in the judges. If they are to fulfill their function as judges, it can hardly be lodged elsewhere. If they act, he says, with conscience and intelligence, they ought to attain in their conclusions a fair average of truth and wisdom. To which I would say, yes, but, judges have always recognized that some matters are best left to Parliament. Two cases show where the Supreme Court has recently drawn this line. The first case concerned the very difficult subject of the prohibition of assisted dying. In Nick Linson in 2014, the majority of the nine justices sitting concluded that Parliament was inherently better qualified than the court to assess whether the law should be changed. Parliament should they decide to be given the opportunity to consider the position. By contrast in Steinfeld and Keiden in 2018, the Supreme Court did make a rare declaration of incompatibility under the Human Rights Act in respect of the law which provides that only same-sex couples can enter into a third. civil partnership as an alternative to marriage. The court granted the declaration even though the government had held an inconclusive consultation, had rejected the immediate extension of civil partnerships to different sex couples and was still actively considering what to do. Judicial restraint is a hallmark of the recognition of the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers. The classical formulation of that doctrine was provided by the French Enlightenment philosopher Montesquieu. In 1748, his book, the spirit of laws, conceptualized a tripartite system of government, composed of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary as independent but interdependent organs of the state. He proclaimed, perhaps rather dramatically, that there would be the end of everything, where the same man or the the same body to exercise those three powers, that of enacting laws, that of executing the public's resolutions, and that of trying the causes of individuals. But respecting the separation of powers between the judiciary, the legislature, and the executive goes both ways. Just as some matters are regarded as the province of the democratically elected parliament, others are regarded as within the purview exclusively of the judges. Four foremost amongst those are criminal sentencing and procedure, and this is the context in which senior judges have been most explicit about the role of the judges in our society. Take, for example, the Privy Council case on an appeal from the Supreme Court of Mauritius in 2006. This concerned the validity of an amendment to the constitution of Mauritius when the legislative assembly there purported to remove the power of the courts to grant bail to someone if the person had been arrested for an offense of terrorism or on a serious drugs charge. The provision denying the chance of being granted bail had been passed by a vote of three quarters of all the members of the democratically elected assembly. When a defendant challenged the constitutional validity of the ban, the state of Mauritius argued, well, how can it be unconstitutional if the ban on bail was contained in the constitution itself? The Supreme Court of Mauritius nevertheless held that the ban was unconstitutional because it was an interference by the legislature into functions which are intrinsically within the domain of the judiciary. The appeal from that judgment came before the Privy Council, which is the board where justices like me of the Supreme Court here appear from a number of former Commonwealth and other countries. The Privy Council agreed with the Supreme Court of Mauritius. The Board held that the Constitution entrenched the principle of the separation of powers between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. As Lord Roger said, democracy does not only mean that the people must decide who governs them. It means also that fundamental rights should be protected by an impartial and independent judiciary. It is that independence in impartiality which enables and indeed requires judges to date decisions which may be unpopular with the public and also sometimes with the government or parliament. But this has been an important part of the judicial function for centuries, protecting the rights, even of the most unpopular members of society against excessive action on the part of the state. I remember in one of my first constitutional law lectures at university being taught about the great case of Entic and Carrington. In November 1764, four men broke into the premises of the writer John Entic and ransacked his cupboards looking for seditious pamphlets that they suspected he had written. John Entic sued them for trespass for coming onto his land without his permission. Their defense was that they had been authorized to carry out the search by the Secretary of State, Lord Halifax. But did the Secretary of State have the power to authorize someone to go onto Entic's land without his consent? The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Camden, held that Lord Halifax did not have that power. Only Parliament or the common law could provide a justification for their actions, not an individual member of the government. More recently, this was explained by Lord Hope, in a case where the House of Lords held that the regime then in place for imposing control orders on suspected terrorists was unlawful, because the orders had been made, taking into account evidence heard by the judge in a closed hearing, when the nature of that evidence was not disclosed to the appellants. The nine strong bench of law lords held that the appellants had not had a fair trial, and the control orders could not stand. Lord Hope articulated the balance between majority interests and minority rights, which the courts must strike when he stated that, it is the first responsibility of government in a democratic society to protect and safeguard the lives of its citizens. That is where the public interest lies. It is essential to the preservation of democracy, and it is the duty of the court to do all it can to rest. and uphold that principle. But the court has another duty too. It is to protect and safeguard the rights of the individual. In this case, the right in issue is the right to a fair trial. That is a right that belongs to everyone, even those who are alleged to be the most capable of doing us harm by terrorism. This echoes an earlier comment he had made about the lawfulness of indefinite detention of foreign suspected terrorists in Belmarsh prison. Marsh Prison. Lord Hope commented that the case was dealing with actions taken on behalf of society as a whole which affect the rights and freedoms of the individual. This is where courts may legitimately intervene to ensure that the actions taken are proportionate. He said it is an essential safeguard if individual rights and freedoms are to be protected in a democratic society which respects the principles that minorities, however unpopular, have the same rights as the majority. This question is also addressed by Al B. Sachs, the great South African jurist and judge. In his fascinating book, The Strange Alchemy of Life and Law, he recounts his experience as a justice on the South African Constitutional Court. He says that just about every case they heard require the justices to make value judgments on issues of major social and moral importance. But how does that square with the respective roles of Parliament and the courts? It is, he said, the judicial responsibility for being the ultimate protector of human dignity that sometimes compels judges to enter into what might be difficult terrain. It is in precisely situations where political leaders may have difficulty with standing popular pressure and where human dignity is most at risk that it becomes an advantage, he said, that judges are not accountable to the electorate. It is at these moments that the judicial function expresses itself in its purest form. Judges, able to rely on the independence guaranteed to them by the Constitution, ensure that justice is done to all without fear, favor, or prejudice. But all of the this poses the question of how far judges are entitled to rely on their own views as to right and wrong, even though they know that those views may not accord with the views of majority of society. Returning to Justice Cardozo, he gives a more light-hearted example than the rather serious cases I've been referring to so far. Let us suppose, he says, a judge who looks upon theatre-going as a sin. It would not be right for him to give effect to that view if it was relevant in deciding a particular case if the judge knows that his view conflicts with the dominant standard of right conduct in society. Judge Cardozo concludes that the judge is under a duty to conform to expected standards of the community, of the morays of the time. But how then does a judge decide what are the accepted standards of the community? The answer, says Cardoza, is that the judge must get his knowledge just as the legislature gets it, from experience and study and reflection. In brief, he says, the answer as to how a judge decides what are the accepted standards of the community is from life itself. Of course, there are a number of assumptions underlying that answer that it's useful to unpack and perhaps to challenge. Humane and thoughtful, though they undoubtedly are, Justice Cardozo's comments are expressed in terms that would not be used to do. today in that they assume that judges are and are likely to remain all men. He was writing in 1921. It took another 60 years before Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was appointed to the US Supreme Court, and another 23 years after that before Baroness Hale was appointed to our own ultimate Court of Appeal, then the House of Lords. Judicial diversity is of course an important topic and the subject of many different lectures, some of them given by me. But the importance of diversity is more than simply ensuring that the judiciary is a better reflection of the society it serves. It is a recognition that the line between the subjective views of the judges on questions of morality and social issues and the objective assessment of what is the right answer is perhaps much less clear-cut than either Justice Cardoza or Justice Albi Sachs may suggest. A judge may be expected to share the notions of right and wrong prevalent in the society in which he or she lives. But those notions are no longer regarded as homogeneous. They probably never were homogeneous. But for centuries, there was only one such set of notions that really counted for anything, that of the dominant cadre of white male middle class judges. When people speak about diversity, they often talk about the need for the perspective and life experience of women, of members of ethnic minority communities and other underrepresented groups to be brought to bear on judicial decision-making. But there's also increasingly a recognition that actually male judges are not completely neutral in their own views and the experience that they bring to the office. So when women are appointed, it doesn't mark the first occasion on which a subjective life experience is brought to bear on the daily work of a judge. It's been happening forever. Let me now turn to a more practical answer to the question of why judges are entrusted by society with the task that we undertake day in, day out, of deciding disputes between parties. Let me give two very different examples. When lockdown was imposed in response to the pandemic, millions of shops and businesses had to close their doors. of them looked at their insurance policies and saw that they were covered for business interruption resulting from infectious diseases. Thousands of claims were brought under such policies by businesses suffering heavy financial loss. But many of the insurers said that the wording of the particular clause in the particular policy did not cover this situation and they refused to pay out. For example, some of the clauses in the insurance policies said that losses from business interruption are covered only if the loss results from the occurrence of a disease like COVID within, say, 25 miles of the premises. But, said the insurers, even if the business owner could show that someone within 25 miles of the shop did have COVID, you couldn't say that it was that person's illness that caused the lockdown and hence the closure of his business. The insurers said that the loss was only covered if the business, if the business could show that it was because of that illness within the 25-mile radius of the shop, that business was interrupted. So the policyholders and the insurers reached an impasse. How do you resolve this? The answer was that the financial conduct authority which regulates the insurance industry and a number of the major insurance companies gathered together a sample of differently worded clauses, each of which is found in many thousands of policies and they asked the court to decide which of them cover lockdown losses and which of them don't. The Supreme Court was able to expedite the hearing and provide a resolution quickly which gave both businesses and insurers alike the clarity that they needed. The Supreme Court held that yes there did have to be somebody with COVID within 25 mile radius of the shop in order for the insurer to pay out but they held it was enough that the that the public lockdown measures were taken in response to all of the cases of COVID in the country as a whole. It was therefore sufficient for the policyholder to show at the time of lockdown that there was at least one case of COVID-19 within the geographical area covered by the cause. They didn't have to show that the lockdown was a result of that person being ill. So the point I'm making is that we need law in order for our society to function smoothly, and because the law is very complicated, because human beings want to do a wide variety of things. In some cases, what's important is not so much the actual answer, but there is someone to give an answer that everyone involved, even the person who loses the argument will accept. So once my colleagues in the Supreme Court handed down their judgment, we accept that everyone will realize that that's the answer. Insurers who had refused to pay out will now pay out, and businesses who had made claims that were held to be untenable will accept that they have no claim. They will be disappointed, but at least they now have an answer, and that was a practical answer that solved a problem of great anxiety for business owners and indeed insurers. My second example is a very different one provided by the High Court 2017 decision in Oldham Metropolitan. Borough Council against Robin Makin. The case concerned the disposal of the body of Ian Brady, the notorious Moore's murderer, who died in May 2017 at Ashworth High Security Psychiatric Hospital. Brady was one of the most reviled criminals of the 20th century, described in another judgment about him in 2001 as uniquely evil. No one wanted to be involved in dealing with his remains. and no local authority wanted any of his ashes to be scattered in their area, particularly not on the Moors where he had committed his terrible crimes and where it was thought that the remains of some of his victims might still be buried. Brady had left a will appointing a solicitor to be his executor and specifying, for example, what music should be played at his funeral. Public feeling was running high and there was a risk of public disorder. order. What to do? By the time the case came before the Chancellor of the High Court, Brady's body had been lying in a mortuary freezer for five months, whilst arguments raged. The Chancellor gave precise directions about what should happen. As to cremation, he directed that there be no music and no ceremony, no flowers and no photography. He named the three people who could attend and ordered that the ashes be disposed of at sea within seven days. And that presumably is exactly what happened, because a judge had ordered that that was what should happen. So I would say that in a practical sense, judges do an important job that needs to be done for everybody to be able to rub along together in society in a reasonably harmonious way. And I like to think that the public accept that we do it reasonably well. And even if they don't always agree with what we decide, They recognize the value in having us there to make those decisions. I started with a quote from Queen Victoria, so let me finish with a quote from our present Queen Elizabeth. She said once, it's all to do with the training. You can do a lot if you are properly trained. In the course of a career as a lawyer, and particularly in a judicial career, you undergo a lot of training about the law. But just as important, you also get to learn a law. lot about human nature and how and why people behave well and how and why they behave badly. That is true whether you specialize in presiding over criminal trials or commercial disputes. To my mind it is the glory of our legal system, particularly the development of the common law, that it is rooted in and grows out of the lived experience of ordinary people. Judges for centuries past and all over the world have been able to play their part in that development and I hope it will be my privilege to be part of continuing that work into the future thank you thank you thank you so much for that opening remarks Lady Rose, you ended with highlighting your privilege and your honour to continue that future. I thought it might be appropriate for us to sort of like, oh, back in time. You're the first lawyer in your family and I just thought maybe all just members would like to know what first led you into pursuing law. I'm not entirely sure, but I did decide I wanted to be a lawyer, a barrister particularly quite early on when I was about about 1415. I'm not sure what it was that first put me in mind to do that. There was one thing I can say which is that my parents were very keen on listening to the ceremony of nine lessons and carols every Christmas Eve and the first lesson is always the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, which I'm sure you can all bring to mind instantly. And what happens is that once they've eaten the apple, God challenges Adam, why did you eat of the apple when I told you not to? And he says, the woman beguiled me. And then he says to Eve, why did you give him the apple? And she says, the serpent beguiled me. And then God turns to the serpent and says, because you did this, curse to you among creatures and on your belly shall you go. And I remember quite young asking my mother, why doesn't God ask the serpent? why he gave the apple to Eve. God asks Adam and Eve to explain themselves but just sentences the serpent without giving him a chance and my mother said something like well God knows that he was guilty and even then I realized that wasn't actually a complete answer to my question and it's something that still bugs me when I listen to that and so maybe I had I mean I can't say from that moment I decided I was going to be a lawyer and defend serpents the world over. But I think that maybe shows that I had a turn of mind that was asking that sort of question. But it's the only thing I've really wanted to do. Wow, that's amazing. You're also like the first women to be taken on what is now called a Muckton Chambers. And in that time, I understand you were sort of like the first. Yes, I was the first female tenant to get in. How was that? I think we were all on a learning curve really. At that time, most men in the professions had not really come across women either at their school or at university or in the workplace. And I think we were all a little bit feeling our way as to how we would behave to each other. I mean, they were always very charming and polite. I went, I found it quite an anxious time. I think that was more to do with me than to do with them. I worried a lot about whether when I said things, I would ask myself, would I have said that if I was a man? Would they have said that to me if I was a man? But then eventually I thought, you can't just go through life constantly editing what you're saying before you say it or deconstructing it after you said it you just have to to be yourself and I think everybody got used to the idea and I was very I was very lucky that some of the men in chambers were very supportive and made it their business to bring me in as a junior barrister into their cases and that's really what got my career started. But some of them were very, didn't know how to speak to me at all about work or about anything. Wow, I think this is incredible that you talk to yourself and you're able to sort of like reaffirm who you are and not change, regards to the environment. I wonder whether you think the environment over time has changed and with regards to how women today are in, in the legal profession? Yes, I think it has changed beyond all recognition, and it is in the process of changing as well. When I started out in the early 1980s, it was already the case though that it was almost equal numbers of men and women qualifying into the professions. And everybody thought then, well, it'll just be another, wait 10 years, 15 years, it'll be equal numbers of men and women as QC's. and then wait 20 years, it'll be equal number of men and women as judges. But of course, that hasn't happened. It's starting to happen now. I think when I was appointed to the High Court bench in 2013, if you looked at the list of seniority of the judges, that was the point at which suddenly a lot more women were starting to be appointed to the senior judiciary. There's been better gender balance and better diversity in other areas of the judicial family, but that has stayed quite resistant to change. But it is now being transformed, yes. That's amazing. I remember in your opening remarks, you highlighted the importance of unelected officials to sort of and the respect and love from the population, I think. I wonder what you would say to reconcile the fact that you highlighted that there's an equality of men and women in qualifying to end that. But despite the changes over the years, you're still, right now at least, presently the only women sitting in the people of justice. What is it? From the perspective of the population, how can they sort of process that? Well, I think it is very important. I think diversity is very important both for people to be able to see that judiciary represents them and for the reason that I discussed in my remarks that it's important that a breadth of life experience is brought to the role. I don't think that any one gender or any one group has a monopoly on empathy or compassion. But I think that the atmosphere within the judiciary and within the court has changed. I think to reflect society changes about what is acceptable. So when I was starting out and in an earlier time still there were some judges who were known to be terrible bullies and people were terrified of appearing in front of them and they would be rude and shout and be very impatient. And that kind of thing is now, and people would just sort of shrug their shoulders and say, well, that's just how they are. But I think that there's a greater recognition that although you do have to be very clever to be a judge, being very clever is not the only quality that you need, that behaviour is there are behaviours which are unacceptable in the workplace, even if the workplace is a high court or a staff room or a factory floor. So I think that there has been a changing attitude, a change in atmosphere, even in courts where all the judges are still men, they behave in a very different way from what used to be accepted. Amazing. Just one final question on sort of at the bar today. I haven't spoken about issues on possible improvements in diversity. What challenges would you say it's most important that the bar is facing today according to you? I think the bar, there is a bit of a difference between criminal barters and the private law commercial. barristers. I think criminal barristers, I know that they are, they are struggling sometimes to make a living on the legal aid rates that they are paid and the backlogs in the criminal justice system, which have been exacerbated by COVID. I think, so I think that that is a, that's an area which is creating difficulties. I think the, but I think the, but I think the, but I think the, bar, lots of aspects of the bar, are thriving and it continues to be a career that attracts a lot of very able people. I mean, my own career was more varied. I was a barrister for 10 years, but then I left and I worked in the government legal service for a number of years before becoming a judge. And I think that there is a, I hope there is amongst students and young lawyers qualified, a greater recognition than there was in my day of the range of opportunities there are to be a lawyer rather than the sort of rather narrow aspiration of being a barrister appearing in court all the time or being a member of one of the big firms in the city there are so many other ways to use your legal skills and so I think that also one of the challenges of the bar is getting that message across that there are a lot of ways in which you can be a lawyer, use your skills, use what you learn when you study, to have an interesting career and to benefit society. Your UK Supreme Court Justice, I can't begin to imagine on what your day-to-day routine is like. Could you give us an insight as to what part of your day you most look forward to? I do really like being in court. I find the hearings very interesting and challenging. We have a tradition in this country that the hearings are quite long and there's a lot of two backwards and forwards between the bench and the the barristers and in fact some barristers say they find it very off-putting if the judge just sit there completely quietly. And that's very interesting. You get to challenge them, well, yes, you say that, but what about this situation, or how would that work here, or what do you say in answer to this? And the best barristers are very good at coming back with a useful answer. So the daily job is preparing for cases. So yesterday, today, I've been preparing for cases that I'm doing next week, and I also heard a case. last week and heard case earlier this week as well and and then you're after the case we decide who's going to write the judgment and then you have to draft the judgment and then you have to give comments to your colleagues drafts so I like all the aspects of it but I think I'm glad that I'm a lawyer and a judge in a jurisdiction which has that focus on the oral hearing and is not just reading the papers. Do you think, as we've spoken about sort of like coming to your drafts and opinions, do you think that the courts might be at risk of politicisation today? And do you think, what do you think we can do to perhaps combat that if that is an issue? I think that, I don't think the courts are politicised because they have to, we don't, We don't necessarily get to decide which cases come to us. We can't generate cases and if a case comes it needs to be decided, then we have to decide it. We can't say, oh no, sorry, I would rather not go there. And so the cases come up. Which cases are regarded as political is I've always found rather difficult. There are some cases which affect the lives of many ways many millions of people which don't get any press attention. And there are other cases which have important but specific legal effect which get a lot of air time. I don't think this is anything very new. I'm sure that in the case of Entick and Carrington that I referred to in 1764, I'm sure there was probably a lot of fuss about that at the time and politicisation of the judiciary. This is not a new issue. It sort of waxes and wanes. But I think that, I think, I hope, that because judges here tend to be not public figures in the sense that, you know, we can walk down the street and people don't know who we are, I think that that's a good thing. I have no desire to be a personality in the public eye. And we just decide the cases according to the law and take what flat comes to us as calmly as we can. No, certainly. I know that it might be the case for us or different aspects, people recognise politication not occurring. At the moment across the United States the court represents what some would say a highly political judicial system and if this leaked draft opinion is anything to go by the UK the US Supreme Court might have just you know overturned Roe v Wade and I just thought back to our earlier comments about the the members of Supreme Court justices probably not representing maybe those who they are personalize the of those who they're presiding over in terms of that agenda. So I wanted to ask a question on what your thoughts are, on the role of judiciary in social policy, especially one where the characteristics of those who sit on the benches that make this very, very important decisions might not reflect in any way the lives that will be impacted. I think that is an issue, and it's an issue not just of perception, but of reality. But on the other hand, I think there's quite a lot of... I think that, as I tried to explain, in the course of a career, I think judges probably have as good an understanding of how difficult the lives of ordinary people are than a lot of people who write about this sort of thing. I mean, I myself did, when I was in the Court of Appeal, did a number of cases about glitches in the Universal Credit rollout. And, you know, the evidence that we read, the witness statements that we read, and it's mainly single mothers, their struggles to manage on the money that they are earning through their work and that they get through the benefit system were heart-rending sometimes. sometimes and sometimes we can do something to ameliorate that but sometimes we can't because it is really a matter for for Parliament to have dealt with so for example apart from the Universal Credit cases I also heard an appeal about the reduction in the about the increase in the pension age for women from 60 to 66 a lot of women in that age bracket who were struggling to make do without getting the state pension that they thought they were going to get. And my sympathies, I certainly felt sympathetic towards them, but as we explained in the judgment, there had been a huge amount of consultation by the government as to what was the best age, how to introduce the changes very gradually, how to make other changes in the system that would counteract those things. And ultimately, it was not something that we could deal with. It was dealt with in primary legislations. That makes it very difficult for us to overturn it. But there are some things where it's really for Parliament, particularly in the allocation of scarce resources, for them to make that call. because we're aware that we only have part of the story. So if we had decided, yes, you must reverse this and pay pensions to all these women, then there are other people who then won't get some benefits because the money has been diverted. And we don't hear from them. They're not before the court, whereas the government and parliament has a much broader view of who benefits and who, what the disadvantage is. So I think that the courts are alert to that the difference of the arguments that are before us and the limited nature of those because of the identity of the particular parties in the case as compared with a wider consultation exercise that the government can take across different departments. No, no certainly I think the role I've highlighted in your opening remark of the government and their representation of the people and the role of the experts that judges place is quite clear. One thing that I really find interesting was you highlight in the role of the judiciary in our society and basically it's duty to preserve effectively human rights and making sure that they use independence in such a way that those who are minorities, no matter how unlikeable they are as protected as the majority. In context of that, recently I think the government is expected to announce in their Queen's speech that they want to replace the Human Rights Convention with the British Bill of Rights. If any, do you have thoughts on this? I'm not, I think it would depend on how, what, I think when you want to make a change like that, it's very important to identify precisely what is wrong with the current system and how you think that's going to improve by what you're going to use to replace it. So I would like to see the discussion that I'm sure will take place as to what mischief, the British Bill of Rights will solve in the existing system because one of the things that I've learned which has been very interesting in my work in the Privy Council where we get to see the constitutions, the written constitutions of a lot of different countries is actually how similar and university and universal are the rights that governments and the people who have elected them think need to be protected. And of course those rights develop human rights instruments are regarded as living documents, which means that they, like the always speaking doctrine that I was talking about, they evolve. And people have rights now which wouldn't have been considered as rights years ago. and that's a very good thing. So I don't think that there's much disagreement about what the core rights are that people should have. The disagreement is more about how and when they evolve. But whether there's anything particularly British that needs to be introduced that we don't share in common with the huge numbers of countries which have expressed the importance of human rights in their own Bill of Rights, I think remains to be seen. Thank you. I'm keen to open the floor up to the audience, should they want to ask any questions. So identify yourself by raising your hand up. Should you have any questions for Lady Rose and one of our delightful members of committee will hand a mic to you. Does anyone have a question? Yes, the gentleman with the blue jacket. Thank you very much. Could I ask a bit more about the Mauritius case to do with bail? Because I was quite surprised. I thought you were going to say that the Privy Council overturned the Supreme Court to Maricious on the basis that what does it mean to be constitutional or unconstitutional if there is a written constitution and something's in that document. I mean, obviously I could see in our case where there isn't a code. Constitution, but I'd just be interested in a bit more than that. Yes, I think the point was that as with a lot of these constitutions, they open with a statement that the Constitution entrenched human rights that the country is a democracy based on the rule of law and recognizing the separation of powers. And so it was really whether the specific amendment to the Constitution prohibiting the grant of bail was actually in conflict with that more broadly expressed provision and therefore could not validly be an amendment to the Constitution because it couldn't stand in the same document as that more broadly expressed important statement by the country of the nature of its own constitution and its own fundamental principles. Thank you. One final question. The member with the Black Jacket. Thank you. Thank you. I was wondering how much awareness you have or how conscious you are constantly about your role as a female judge because I kind of think it can also create a kind of pressure or have like a negative impact. Like on the one hand you emphasized that it's important to bring diversity and different perspectives into court, but on the other hand, constantly knowing you are the only female judge and you have to bring in female perspective. I was wondering whether that imposes a sort of pressure, because I remember in Radmacher and Granitino, Lady Hale, she had a very strong dissent and she kind of also talked about, you would probably expect me as a female judge to speak against this. I was just wondering if it's something you also have faced. I think because I know that Lady Hale discusses this in her memoir, Spider Woman, I think that because my work has always always been on the more commercial side of law, there's less opportunity actually in the cases for me to bring a particularly feminine point of view. It just doesn't really arise. I think where it does arise is perhaps in conducting court. I remember one of the very first cases I did after I've been appointed was a very, very bitter dispute between two businessmen and the barristers involved had a reputation of being very aggressive and very difficult to manage in court. And when I told my colleagues I was doing this case, they said, oh, who are the barristers and I named them, I won't name them now. And they're oh dear, you're going to have trouble with them. So I thought, well, how will I deal with this? I'm not going to win in a testosterone fight with them. So instead, I will model good behavior. So I went into court. I was very smiley and calm and polite and light about everything. And they were absolute lambs for the whole period of the trial. And when I was counting this to my colleagues, they were astonished because of course that's not how they had dealt with it. So I think it maybe affects things in that way. But I don't think it for me, because of the nature of the cases I've done, I don't think it particularly affects my decision making. Maybe in the now I do more public law cases. is now in the Supreme Court, maybe it will do more. Watch this space. Thank you so much for coming this evening. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking Lady Pratt. You know,
