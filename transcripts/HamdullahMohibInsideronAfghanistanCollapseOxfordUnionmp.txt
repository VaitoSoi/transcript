 Thank you for today. Thank you for joining us this evening at the Oxford Union. I just thought we should just start by taking us this evening at the Oxford Union. I just thought we should just start by taking a look at what happened between April to August 2021. In April, the US and NATO announced that they would draw from Afghanistan by September with the span of the month, the Taliban gained control of major borders like Chapim, Spinbordak and key cities. The Afghan army, under your supervision, of course, was well equipped, more in numbers and had many years of training. Why do you think that the army withdrew accusedly from most areas without firing one shot? Well, the collapse of the Afghan security forces began a long time ago and it was when the negotiations with the US and the Taliban began. I objected at the time about what it was going to do to the Afghan government, delegitimized the government and the government give legitimacy to the enemy that we were fighting in the Taliban. And there was a lot of whitewashing of the Taliban that began. And the Afghan security forces who were heavily dependent on the Americans and other NATO allies were also heavily dependent on the contractors that provided support to these security forces. When the announcement was made in April, in addition to the withdrawal of air power and air support to the A&SF, they also removed contractors. And it set a panic in the security forces. But I think more importantly, the narrative around what was happening was one that was the most detrimental, the whitewashing, like I said, of the Taliban, the signals that there are a government in waiting. At one point the Taliban boasted that they don't need to talk to the Afghan government because there are so many foreign ministers waiting in line to meet them in Qatar that they are already going to be on their way in and all they had to do is wait. And this cannot be separated from the Afghan society. Of course the security forces fought bravely. As far as the they could and then when it felt like it's a losing battle there was there was a morale decline and they ended up having to stop I think with as any war it's important to know who the enemy is and when that that line between who the enemy is blurs with it becomes really difficult for any soldier to be able to continue to fight of course you explained in the past about different people that have to blame with the tragedy has occurred and blame could be shared. Your responsibility is natural security advisor I guess is responsible for how things flow down from the top. But at that time there was wide criticism of the fact that there wasn't a cohesive opinion. What is your view or responsible people that felt like there was divisions in at the top level of the army which perhaps created more confusion and what role did you have in that well I think all of us you know me included the leadership in the Afghan government the elite that provided the or created the base for the government and the Republic as a whole Parliament media civil society we all have a this blame to share and I think it's going to weigh on us for the rest of our lives Those who would like to shift the blame and make it sound like it was a few individuals that were the decision-making and decision-makers and has to be responsible. I understand where they are coming from. But I think in the way the Republic was run, some of the things that we are very proud of, for example, media, civil society, the political class, the elite that had created the opposition in the Parliament, played. Sorry, sorry to interrupt you. I just thought the question was more specifically about the divisions at the top of the army and whether you for the conflict of opinion had any effect in the reception of instructions from the lower officers. Please say that again. Divisions between the army, what do you mean? More like the conflict of opinion at the top of the army, and the effect that probably had trickling down to the actions of the officers and soldiers. Well, I think all the army officers did what they could. I am extremely proud of every one of them that served and tried to do what they could possibly do to prevent what happened. I you know at the there was a time when Afghanistan was losing up to 50 people a day 50 soldiers who were fighting for Afghanistan and then and that is when they're they believed in an Afghanistan that was that was supported by the international community that was that had the legitimacy to be able to provide for its population but when the discourse shifted to an enemy that we had been fighting that they had been fighting actively I mean we all Afghans were but those that were on the front line are the ones that took the brunt of it and when they were at the when they were fighting had become no longer an enemy but a government in waiting I think you would understand that their reasoning for continuing to fight was shaken Hmm. You're proud of the soldiers and that's obviously something that we all commend and anyone would. A question that's been ringing in the minds of perhaps those outside right now is why have you not yet perhaps apologize to the people of Afghanistan? More specifically the brave men and soldiers who are now in hiding and being haunted by the Taliban for what they perceive to be systematic and gross failures at the top. Look, I'm in touch with a lot of those soldiers who were and the commanders who were fighting. And I think it's easy to look at it from the outside perspective and say, hey, this is what needs to be done. But I think over time, many things will become even more clearer than it already has. A big part of what the people are angry outside about. And I totally understand their anger and frustration. is about the events of what happened in the last few days. But Afghanistan didn't collapse in a few days. And the decisions that were made were for the best of the country at the time. There was the atrocities that the Taliban are committing right now, even today, and we have videos that those that are following from Panshir in Andarab, and the women's protesters all across the country whose rights have been taken away from them we were cornered to give them legitimacy and that's not something that would have weighed well on any Afghan flights these things would have continued to take place and the Taliban would have had legitimacy for it I think what what the what the elephant in the room is the discussion around around August 15th rather than the overall structure because if we are to go into the details of the rest of it there is a lot to talk about. Yeah, of course. So ultimately, your belief is that the American actions are as larger to blame with this. And I guess you probably, would you just say that NATO in the US's consort with the President Guy at the time, would you agree that they announced their withdrawal? Would you agree that they were adequately, President Guy who was adequately informed throughout the process? Look, we had no issue with the US withdrawing from Afghanistan. That was long planned for 2024. And I personally, again, in March 2019, went to the US, went to Washington, and objected to the process that they were terming as a peace process, but was masquerading a withdrawal agreement. And our argument was, if you wish to withdraw, that is fine, negotiate with the legitimate government of Afghanistan. That will give us a fighting chance. But if you continue down, this path I warned then that it would delegitimize the Afghan government and and that is exactly what happened not just in in the context of the domestic politics but also regionally our our neighbors starting to bet on the Taliban because they assumed that that is what was going to happen and after the agreement the February 29 agreement 2020 with the Taliban that became even more apparent because of what was inside the agreement Right. So that's, I'm guessing you're a friend to the effected Doha negotiations. The Doha agreement with the Taliban. In that case, why do you think the United States chose to engage in negotiations and make substantial concessions if you think that there was every eventual reason that Taliban was acting in bad faith? Well, you know, I have said across foreign diplomats, ambassadors, including from the UK, and argued that the Taliban are not to be trusted. But the rhetoric at the time was they have changed. And what they believed they could do with the Taliban was manage them or push back against them is by conditional aid or the conditionalities that were impacting the republic. Now, of course, that was wrong, and we argued that. at the time that if you were to apply the conditions that you apply to the Republic which is dependent financially on the US and its allies is different to what the Taliban are seeking legitimacy from the Taliban do not care about about legitimacy from the the world in order what they care about legitimacy is the jihadi community and they obviously have given that everything argued has termed to be true and I see some of those exact same diplomats turning around making the argument that the Taliban have not delivered on their promises when they were warned for three years straight that these are not people to be trusted and those who were sitting in Doha were trained by NGOs and I guess not governments but directly maybe supported indirectly through aids and funding to train them to negotiate. They knew exactly what to say, to be heard, but they knew and we knew and we had intel to believe that they did not wish to continue or keep their promises, that that was just a tactic to pass time and achieve the objective they wanted to achieve. So that seems like a clear signature. that you knew that there would need to properly reinforce the army and properly engage with the Taliban in a way that would secure the country. Yet we ended up in a situation where despite your warnings, despite the fact that you even said to the people of Afghanistan that you're going to fight to the end and you won't leave. On the 15th of August 2021, you said, Mr. President, it's time to leave. this is advice you gave Ghani at the time. Do you have a sense of responsibility and accountability to the Afghan people in light of this? I think, again, people are looking at this situation right now, not what the possibility was. I am of the generation that grew up during the Civil War. And I know how much that impacted Afghans all across. I was a refugee at the time in Peshawar and the way we were treated all Afghans. were treated. And the suffering that the Afghans had to go through, not at the hands of the Soviet Union, but at the hands of Afghans who were fighting for power in destroying their own capital. We had nothing that was an infrastructure that is required for a state to be sustained, from airport to telephone, to electricity, any hospitals, anything that would allow Afghans to be able to stay in their country or even support it, had all been taken away from. from them during that civil war. This was a critical moment. We either go into a phase where we enter another civil war, destroy everything that has been built over the last 20 years. It's not just about buildings. It's about what they represent in terms of infrastructure. No Afghan lives were taken during this process. In the end, when things were gone, we were going to lose anyway. two weeks and in two weeks the Taliban knew that they will be back, they will be in full power because the Americans would have gone. Our security forces have disintegrated. There is no consolidated force. The Afghan political elite in Kabul are all divided. Some are already flying to Pakistan in other capitals and have made deals around the region for their own safety. They only had to wait two weeks. But what would have happened and ensued in these two weeks is we We lose all the infrastructure that we have built, a city of 5 million people that was now even more crowded because of the displaced people from fighting all around the country. We would have lost thousands of lives. I know that when people think of the last two weeks of the U.S. presence, they think of the Kabul airport and how people cramped into the airport trying to escape. But imagine most of those people being. being held inside the city in a conflict, in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands being killed. The Afghan political elite, there was a very likely, there is a big likelihood that most of these people who are today alive and still advocating for change in Afghanistan would have been killed. And so what we were making, what the decision we were making was for Afghanistan. It upset a lot of people in foreign capitals. It upset our key partner in the United States. But that was the decision that was necessary for Afghanistan. And I think in 10 years' times, the Afghans will view it differently. Just to want back to the actual question, I recognize that there are things are quite complicated. And you highlighted in your response that you knew already at some point that the war was lost. But the context is that you are at the top of the government. You're telling young people to go to the front lines and fight, giving them inspiration to put their life on the line for the country. You promised you wouldn't leave. Do you understand the pain and anguish that might be thought and why people might think that you are treated or would accuse you of being a coward if the earliest opportunity you tell Garney, it's time to leave? I understand the emotional sentiments of it. But especially when we're yet to hear, I mean, Afghan people express they're yet to hear an apology for this. I've spoken to the Afghan people before any other interview. My first public comment, even though none of the Afghan leaders have come out to speak and talk to the people, no one was an observer. Whether these were media moguls or ministers, ministers, no one was an observer. If they benefited from the government and everything that was given to them, then they were obviously responsible at their own level. Everyone was responsible at their own level, including myself. And I have publicly said that. I am not away from it. And me sitting here today in front of, I can see people here who are looking at me with anger. and I am taking this bold step to be here and answer, I know the questions they were going to ask. I'm hearing the people shouting outside. I know what it is. But I think it's important that we have a constructive debate about what is going to save our country. My fight in Afghanistan, my cause for Afghanistan has not ended. It is what would have benefited at that time. an embarrassment for a country. We had lost a country, an embarrassment for a large number of Afghans, whether someone agrees with it or disagrees with it. The president of a country has a large amount of support and to be hanged and embarrassed in front of their population would have broken the country even further and taken away the cause to continue to ask for the democratic rights that we as a people deserve. And that was a decision at that time that was available to us. And the opposite side of it would have been no good for Afghanistan. If any good came out of, any good was to come out of another decision at that time, we would have taken it. Look, I also know that there is a lot of propaganda that was spewed because during that period we were under extreme distress. Our country just collapsed. There was propaganda to say there was a deal that would have saved Afghanistan. What deal? We were promised deals for the last three years, and every time the goalpost kept moving. The goalpost initially when the negotiations started, that the U.S. would negotiate with the Taliban for a few days, and then the Afghan government and the Afghans would sit across the Taliban and negotiate in good faith, and that a democratic sovereign Afghanistan would be the result of that, that negotiation. None of that happened. Seasfire was supposed to have been a cause. Ceasefire never happened. Violence increased and intensified. Secret deals, military deals were made that the Afghan security forces were not in the loop. We were told there would be no prisoners mentioned in the agreement with the Taliban that it was not their leverage. 5,000 prisoners were not only released, sorry, mentioned there, we were strong armed to release that. We were We were told it would not be, that is not our leverage. The continuation of violence by the Taliban was condemned, but never taken any action on. We were told not to have military operations, military offensive operations. We were stopped from that because we would have been an impediment to peace. And the Taliban kept encroaching on the Afghan capitals and provincial capitals and district centers. And so to believe two weeks in to say that the deals there. To believe that two weeks were left and the Americans were going to withdraw and the Taliban were going to negotiate in good faith at that time in that there was a deal. You know, if anybody believes, anybody believed that at that stage, I think would be the peak of naivety. I mean, President Karzai believed that he claims that on 15th of August, the Taliban agreed to form an interim government to oversee the handover of power, but this was of course prevented by the flight, the escape. Again, in 10 years, when books in history is written and a lot of people come out to be able to talk freely because now is a very political environment and there are states whose benefits are at stake and people who sit here would know that politics is all local. So the domestic elections in the US and its impact is perhaps preventing some of those people who are actively on duty now. When those information come out, you would know, and the Afghans will know better, that there was no interim government. The Taliban wanted a surrender. A surrender. I personally spoke to Americans officials at that time. there was no word the word inclusive or a coalition government or any all of those were gone the word used was non-monopoly so there was going to be a government that the Taliban are fully in control of and maybe have a couple of other Afghans who are there just to be to give it a term non-monopoly and then that government be legitimate if if today the Taliban government was legitimate it had continued the atrocities it has right now there would be no voice for us to be able to stop them from anything that that we could they would be more powerful they would have more resources and and they would further imprison the Afghan people today we still have a chance and we had to make that decision for Afghanistan it upset people outside of Afghanistan and they had a media campaign around it just like they had with the whitewashing of the Taliban, and they will continue to do so because they need to deflect from what they did, which was a true betrayal of Afghanistan, and for that. If I can again, we send a focus back to the exact question posed to yourself and trying to hold, not holding you to account myself, but don't understand things from your perspective or what your actions are. You said that there are different deals that you believe that aren't really real, and that can be accepted. We explained how, you know, Fleen was the best thing, because perhaps a word in which slain the leader would lead to more bloodshed in the city. But still, opponents or people who were still there have legitimate questions to believe that, you know, a more orderly evacuation process might have occurred had things of transition a bit differently. I think former Vice President Aram al-A-Sala stayed to resist the Taliban in Fangesha with Ahmed Massoud. Why didn't he fully, did you ask him to come on the plane too? If the concern is about an evacuation process, that would have been more orderly and maybe 100 or 200,000 people would have been able to vacate orderly, then I think we have lost the point. There are 44 million people in Afghanistan. This is the current statistics from the UN. And Afghanistan's population is 44 million people. And what about all of them? And the United States came to Afghanistan, promised the Afghan people democracy, promised the Afghan people a new future. At the time, the Taliban surrendered, and they agreed to live peaceful lives in Afghanistan in return for amnesty and in return for a peaceful transition. They said no. We fought. For every American killed in Afghanistan, there has been a thousand Afghans killed. We have had close to a quarter million casualties in the last 20 years. 70,000 A&DSF, but the civilians and everybody else that could be counted reaches close to a quarter of a million. What was all of that for? We fought shoulder to shoulder with the United States because they said the Taliban were a terrorist group or a group that supports a terrorist network and they did not want to turn Afghanistan or Afghanistan to be turned back into a safe haven for those terrorist groups. The Afghan people welcomed that. We did not want terrorists on our ground. We did not want to be associated with them. We fought back. And then the US turns around and says, this is a long war. We are tired and we are now going to withdraw from your country and what we are going to do is negotiate with the enemy, negotiate with the enemy directly, undermine everything that you have been trying to build, pull the rug under your feet, and then leave you to your fate. So those 44 million people who have animosities with the Taliban and given that most of the people that are currently being executed by the Taliban that are being prosecuted by the Taliban are not ones that were eligible for evacuation. Those were the local police, the uprising forces who fought the Taliban at their localities. These were at the village level, at the district level, and they continued to be left to their own mercy there. And so if the whole discussion is around the evacuation, I'm sorry, we missed the point. I totally appreciate the efforts of all of the NGOs and all of the people, the friends of Afghanistan that worried about their friends and tried to get them out. But what about the people they didn't know? What about their fate? So when you are in a position of authority and you're in a position, you have to think about the broader spectrum of what happens to all of Afghanistan, not just to a group of people. And what you said about people resisting the Taliban? Absolutely, you know, to this day and it will continue. The Taliban, resistance to the Taliban, is. only going to grow. This fight will grow. The Taliban also left Afghanistan, but when they came back, when politics went wrong, they strengthened. And today with each passing day, resistance to the Taliban is going to get strengthened and strengthened, whether it's political or diplomatic. And I'm glad to see that most capitals, most of our partners who believe that the Taliban have now seen the real face of the Taliban and our change. And our change, and our changing their narrative, but also those who are going to have no other choice but to fight the Taliban back will also increase. I think we've gone way off to that question. But I wanted to pick on one thing you said about how many of the people who are most affected are still left behind. And at the moment there is a situation where we have people starving and struggling to find food. also in addition to loss of different types of liberties. But in the purview of this, it's also allegations that perhaps yourself and Presengarni left the country with millions of dollars of public money. With balancing how you recognize right now that it's not just about one person or two people, it's about everyone, how do you reconcile these allegations if they are true? And how do you reconcile that in the context of the fact that many people are left without resources that they otherwise could have access to. I have already spoken about this. I have spoken to investigative bodies like Segar, given the information that is necessary to do. I didn't go to Afghanistan to take money. I had a better job before I even joined the government. I made financial sacrifices. The salary I was getting before I joined the government, I don't even have right now. A year worth of it, I don't even own anymore. I'm really sorry. We weren't there to serve. We've got limited to time. I just want to make sure that we're able to get through lots of questions that people want to go through. And happy to, if you can answer the question as directly as possible, I'm, I'm answering your question. You said it's allegations. It's again by the people who are trying to divert attention from the real, real discourse. No one at that moment was thinking about anything other than to be able to save whatever lives we had at that moment there. and save Afghanistan from an embarrassment and end a war that will go that has brought enough suffering to a people. We deny the allegations and we don't think, is that the case you would do that allegation are not true? Any sane man person would not believe the allegation. Okay. Sweet. Just moving on to try to think about what responsibility the government itself had in this whole affair. You know, President Ghani and the team have been accused of being out of touch with the Afghan people, the brilliant elites outside of Kabul. Was political leadership outside Kabul consorted or taken into confidence when key decisions were being made? Look, there is always criticism of government. There is criticism of the UK government. There is criticism of the US government. All policies can be criticized and no government is ever going to be immune to that. Whether people were sufficiently consulted, absolutely. Afghanistan had a parliament. we had again civil society, we had the media, opinions were reflected in all walks of life. And when key decisions were made like the release of prisoners that we were forced to release, and it came down to those that were going to be the most dangerous to the Afghan people. The government, despite pressures from the US, did not release it without first consulting the Afghans. We held a lower Ejirga, again, under tremendous amount of pressure. but went to them and gave them exactly why they were being released. We even made sure that before we go to this Lojejerga, we have the exact promises provided by the U.S. Secretary of State on what it will deliver to the Afghan people. They promised that there is going to be a significant reduction in violence. They promised that there will be direct negotiations with the Afghan negotiating team immediately starting that. and that violence will end. I'm sorry, I was asking about the government. This is the government I'm talking about. This is the government consulting the people on all decisions that were made, that were being made. And again, like I said, whether it was key decisions, laws, or any being passed, it all went to the parliament. We had an active democracy. And so, yes, were there criticism? I myself am critical of some of, of the things that we did in government. I think I will continue to be critical, very critical of even my own institution. And there were a thousand things that I wanted to do to reform further in the security sector that we were not able to do. So in terms of criticism, people are in their right to be able to criticize and criticize. And I hope that we have a debate, an open discussion about exactly what happened and have lessons learned. so that the future of Afghanistan does not repeat some of those mistakes. Of course, criticism should be loving and then also responded to you, which I think is the engagement in debate. And going much more specifically on this issue, you know, regional power brokers such as the Duttu and Isma alkan were essential key individuals in the resistance towards Taliban. But of course it analyzed that these relationships were neglected and as you highlighted different points and trigger turning points in how we got to the 15th of August 2021 and what everyone had to play in it. What role do you think the government's in the neglection of the power brokers outside of Kabul had in the role of how easy it was for the Taliban to take over? Okay. I think you come to a point where the, It's an important point, and I'm going to take a pause back in this. The effort of the Afghan government and the international allies was to build a state in Afghanistan. Before they arrived, there was civil war, and then the Taliban regime. So what we hoped for, what Afghans supported the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, was for to build a state where there isn't the rule of our country, a few individuals, but rather laws and institutions that deliver to the people. And that was at the core of the Afghan government before President Ghani and after to build. And I think on this the Afghans had consensus. Consensus was built strong institutions, not strong men. And that was also the agenda of the government led by President Ghani. So the complaints about why individuals were not given rights or why individuals were not strengthened comes into play about why the Afghan government was set up. And so when it came to political decisions, all of these individuals had a significant sway in the Afghan government. Most of these leaders had ministers in the cabinet. Now they themselves did not want to be ministers, but they had ministers in the cabinet. They had parliamentary members in the parliament and the Senate. And again, they owned TV stations. So they had active participation in the debate in Afghanistan. Some of these people had their sons and daughters as ambassadors abroad as diplomats representing Afghanistan. So to say that the Afghan government was ignoring any of these is completely counter to the fact. Okay, so maybe they weren't ignoring it. Perhaps another view is that they weren't the best suited position to be able to actually broker decisions given that these relationships are quite individual and personal based. You know, yourself and President Ghani spent most of their working lives outside of Afghanistan. Therefore, do you think maybe you were the best people to run the Afghan state in the sense that many of these relationships and the influences you need, perhaps had not had the local connection or to properly exploit it. Afghanistan went through a long war, an invasion by the Soviet Union, a civil war and a Taliban regime. In 2002, when the United States came to Afghanistan, most of the people that it brought and brought together were from abroad. They were the Afghan diaspora, whether they were in the US, in Europe, in Rome, in Pakistan, In Iran, they were brought together under the Bonn agreement to be able to set up the transitional government and then the elections process. Afghans, no matter how long and where they live, are living in a diaspora or as refugees. Have the right. I was 16 when I came to the United Kingdom and I was seven years later back in Afghanistan after finishing studies here. And most of my life was with the United Kingdom. Afghans and while I was here as a student I worked with the Afghans in the diaspora here started a student association most of my time was spent with Afghans and trying to better our ourselves and that is what drove me back to Afghanistan despite the advice of my family and everybody else suggesting that it's better to focus on a career here there are a lot of people who take that choice and I respect them for that My entire life was driven by what I lost as a child in Afghanistan. The civil war, the fighting, and I wanted to bring peace to our country. Now, we are not able to bring that as a result of what we were, the dependency on foreign aid and the dependency on foreign military support. But I hope that in my generation, or at least, in our lifetime that we see an Afghanistan that is on a part to stability where no more Afghans will have to leave their country. Thank you. I'm really keen to ensure we get some audience questions. But before I move on to that, I perhaps want to ask more about your relationship, well, what your perception of the relationship between the Afghan government and their neighbours are. There's been views that, you know, criticism of Pakistan by your government. What role do you think Pakistan has had in the Afghan crisis and Taliban take over? I have been on public record about the Pakistani government's support, particularly its intelligence agency and supported by the military for the Taliban. And at the time we spoke about the enabling environment that Pakistani government provides to the Taliban in Pakistan. And this is sanctuaries for them to be able to live there freely. It is about for them to be able to live there freely. for them to be able to organize militarily, have political activity, financial activity, be able to take their injured for treatment to Pakistan and do that freely. Now, all of this we argued, provided for the Taliban to be able to do what they are, to launch that insurgency in Afghanistan and fight and give them the strength. Now, since I have left Afghanistan, it has become even more how important it is for any activity to have foreign sponsorship. Now, the Afghans who are trying to organize politically are not able to do that in any of the neighboring countries right now. The Pakistanis are not allowing it with their close relationship with the Taliban, obviously. The Iranians are not willing to allow their country to be used. They don't want to get into another conflict with the Taliban. The Central Asian countries are not allowing this activity. A lot of the Afghan political elite went to Turkey and again the government there isn't allowing the space for political organization. And we, President Ghani and I went to the United Arab Emirates and again they are not willing to provide political space. So the space Pakistan provided the Taliban was really a lifeline. Had it not been for that space, that enabling environment, the Taliban would have not been able to sustain their insurgency for so long. And not just sustain it, I think they would have been militarily defeated much earlier. Could a small amount of insurgency remain? Maybe. But in the large scheme of things, without this generous support that the Pakistani government provided or Pakistani military provided to the Taliban, they would have not been able to sustain it. That's interesting. I just want to quickly touch on support militarily. I understand that you've directly appointed over like 200 police chiefs in districts across Afghanistan and some say that that's completely bypassing the standard procedure and a chain of command. These were the first provincial districts to collapse, either due to desertion or due to deals made by police chiefs with the Taliban allegedly. Many claim that you had a hand in this order, handover. But my question wants to be much more nuanced in recognizing how this links with the lack of propping up of the military, given that there are unaccounted soldiers in addition to appointing officials that are accused of improper relations. The Afghan security forces built and supported by our international allies had different levels of support. Now we are talking when we come to the military there was a lot more direct engagement by the US military and other nations including the UK in its support. When it came to the police and there were different units some of them were for crisis response and those were trained and started training being trained by the UK but then other countries participated in building and training those those units and then there was the National police whose job was law and order. And part of the reforms in all of these institutions were, when they were built, of course, they attracted soldiers and officers from the former military during the previous governments in Afghanistan. It attracted from the Mujahideen's militias. And it also tried to recruit new officers. And for 20 years, there had been a disorganization in most of the military. of this because the cultures differed and our effort was to try to bridge that by bringing in officers who were trained by NATO and the US allies so that we have consistency in our ranks and and those efforts were conducted in coordination with our international partners never on their own and any appointments made were made by the the line ministries the the National Security Council, which is a meeting, but the Office of the National Security Council, coordinated and provided the Secretariat for the President to process the changes that were necessary. But what was being done was done in due process, all of these appointments. I think, again, people who would like to deflect, try to point to those, but not the case. These were professionally processed reforms that had the support of our international allies. If we accept that, some in your own government still believe that there were gaps that were unaccounted for and as national security advisor, perhaps it's your purview to prevent those gaps. I think in November 2021, the former Afghan finance minister said that the military, The majority of Afghanistan's 300,000 soldiers were ghost soldiers. They just did not exist. This is what the words of your colleagues was. Do you agree with this assessment? I actually not only agree with this assessment. I believed in it and we pushed a big part of the conflict with the NS, the Office of the National Security Council, which was implementing the orders of the President with the line ministries was on these issues. We tried to push that. accountability be provided. Even a few days in a few days before the collapse of the of Kabul the report given to the president from the Ministry of Defense was that we have 170,000 army personnel and it was clearly not true we had lost numerous districts and we had lost cities and the report in coming in obviously frustrated the president. Who would be held accountable for this like who do you think is responsible or should prevent it that? Those that were responsible for the ministries at the time, of course, the systems that were in place. The systems or the people that created systems? All of us, you know, all of them. Again, I will tell you that the military had direct, not supervision, but advisory from a body in the Resolute Support Mission called Sistica, which built software for the maintenance of security officers. And when I went into the Office of the National Security Council, I started to notice discrepancies in the casualties that we are being reported to us. So we would get casualty reports by the Ministry of Interior and Defence that contradicted the numbers that the intelligence agency reported. So we started pushing back on that. We started making them give us not just the numbers, but giving us the names on who these people are, with their identities, but also trying to verify those numbers with local leaders, provinces, to make sure that the numbers being provided were right. There was obviously a big amount of corruption in the security force. This is being reported by CIGAR and our own government. And we tried to reform that. So, I mean, given that response, one can empathize with the feeling from Afghanistan if food as if perhaps it's not just the Americans. It might be that our, the army was ill prepared and those in charge. Who built the army? I mean, the Afghans didn't have the resources to build the army. The Afghans couldn't pay for the army. Our entire budget, our entire budget income was not even $2 billion. And the army was spending $5 billion that was not directly being spent by the Afghan ministries. There was a small amount of budget that the Afghan Ministry of Interior and Defense spent on their own. But the majority of that was being provided and spent by our international allies directly. So whether it was contracts for oil, it was contracts for ammunition, whether it was contracts, for repair, all of those contracts were given out by CISDICA, an entity that remained until the last days and even then tried to, as it was withdrawing, was trying to shift that agency to a third country, and they did, and was trying to provide support to the Afghan security forces over the horizon. And even in the last days, we're not handed over to the Afghan. So, you know, I am... We were as frustrated by the in the leadership, by the Afghan, by what was happening in the Afghan security forces. And a big effort was put into place to reform them, to professionalize them. And it paid off to a great degree. But in 2019, when we started, that was the last offensive that the Afghan defense and security forces launched. I was the national security advisor. I just started the year prior. and my plan and my push was give us an offensive that can go and push the Taliban to peace to push them we knew that we had to eventually make peace with the Taliban just just Abbasid Mohib like the question that I asked was more specific and about how you feel or what you respond to those people who felt as if the government may have felt them and not just American are responsible for it but in the interest of time I would like to open up to the floor. But I'll tell you this that, I'll tell you this, that Afghans, is it okay? Because we've literally, you've not got much time. But I would have to answer that because it's an important point. The Afghans were all angry. We in the government are, we share that. This is my whole point. There isn't a division between the public, the government, or it was all the same. We shared that same frustration. Now, just because the Afghan government didn't go and publicly, state it was trying to do its job and when it comes to crisis and responsibilities there are audience members who have guns I have questions to ask you as well I recognize the member with the black jacket there hi my name is Tumaya I'm from Afghanistan I'm the first world scholar doing my second masters in international human rights law so let's cut the chase you talk a lot about blame game and talk about not blaming each other and moving on and hearing your side of the story. And that starts with accountability. What are you doing to hold yourself accountable for what you have done? By coming and speaking at these platforms, is this accountability? Do you think this is accountability? Shouldn't you be tried in a court? Just because we don't have a nation anymore where you can be held at a court and evidences can be provided against you doesn't mean that you're not a criminal in the eyes of Afghan public, but also that you have committed crimes. Secondly, you mentioned a lot of these information and insights all of a sudden about what happened and what you knew, how our national security forces were not capable to fight, that the army would have collapsed, all this information. Why are you sharing it now? Why? Why were you not sharing? it when Afghans were at the front line fighting and losing their lives. Because you had a backup plan, you knew you could leave. Why? Why now? What's the point? Thank you, Samara. What do you have to tell to the mothers who lost their children, lost their children at the front lines? What do you have to tell to them? It's not about frustration. And please, do not put this as frustration. I grew up as an Afghan refugee as well, in Peshawar, exactly where you grew up. Don't play the victim. Order, can we allow a response from... No, I... Look. Is it okay to keep it as brief as possible, so all the questions to come through, please? Your frustration and your anger... I said that, please do not say it's frustration. Your anger. Your anger. After you do questions, I want the answers. Your anger is absolutely justified, you know, as is the anger of all of the mothers who lost their lives in Afghanistan. Did you lose the family member? I absolutely did. You have no idea how many of my family members have lost. I saved a lot of members. Order, please. I understand this is a very emotional. If you would like an answer, I'm happy to give you that answer. But if you'd like to be angry, I'm there for you then too. The reason I'm saying this is because we went through four decades of war. And every time, and a foreign country, that supported the conflict in Afghanistan came in and left when it suited its needs. We didn't organize ourselves. In our government, our government collapsed. Order, please, let's ensure we can get the responses. Our government collapsed because there was no unity of purpose. Afghan media was advertising, you're telling me why I wouldn't want to say that the Afghan army has weaknesses because that is exactly what led to the demoralization. When Tolo News is publishing report after report after report that says the Afghan army is not capable, the Taliban are advancing, there is weaknesses in the Afghan army, no weaknesses in the Taliban, the Taliban have changed, interviewing and giving them parading all of that. Do you think the Afghan army looked and said that this is good for me? Absolutely not. Foreign general. You did not pay the soldiers for six months. We did. Again, soldiers were paid until the last day of the government. There was one set of people who were not paid, and that is the local police. And the US cut funding for it on 2020 September, and they had three months of additional funding that were provided. Later than that, the Afghan government tried to scramble every piece of budget it could to cover those funds. to cover those fundings and try to accommodate all of those. Now, again, I am here to answer all of these rumors that are out there. These are not, if you think that the world, Afghanistan would have justice, if the questions that are being, or the rumors that are being circulated, is what we base the future decisions of Afghanistan, that I think is injustice. You think it's pleasant for me to sit here and answer to you? in this anger? No, it would be much easier like everybody else to sit at home. To sit at home, I don't have to face you. I don't have to face anybody here. I don't have to face media. I don't have to face these tough questions. What for? What do I gain from it? I gain that we again do not suffer another war at the cost of our people when they and their benefits walk away. When the Afghan jihad happened, my family fought and it was supported by the Americans, by the Saudis, by the world because we were fighting the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union withdrew, where were those people to help rebuild Afghanistan? What happened to all of those families? The Americans came, they promised the world to the Afghan people, to the Afghan women. Where was that cause those three years when all of this was happening? I am responsible and so is every person in a position of responsibility in Afghanistan. Whether that responsibility was being at the head of the the news channel and owning a media channel or whether it was the head of the parliament whether it was at the head of the peace council whether it was national security advisor minister of defense i'm just going to call for another question really quickly so another speaker of excuse me excuse me i have to speak uh excuse me excuse me excuse me order Apologies for the Apologies for the interruption guys. Recognize that obviously this controversy and there's lots of emotional experience Accusations I don't have a house in Florida I can't buy that There is a Please please please do that But don't accuse there isn't My brother lives in a rented apartment. I don't like to talk about this, but I suffer since the collapse of the afternoon. I lost everything. Not that, not that. The opposite of it. Thank you. Thank you. Because this is a lot. Okay. I served my country with honesty, and I am good for it for as long as it can. Never has my family taken any contracts from the government? Never. They suffered, unfortunately, they suffered as a result of being my related to me. My family, my sisters, had to move homes from Jalalabad because of direct Daish threats. They still live. I evacuated my bodyguards, but I did not evacuate my sisters or my brothers from Afghanistan. My entire family lives there. The Taliban took my ancestral home in my village. They destroyed the grave of my mother, my father. Okay? We did what we could and what was being prevented is, is accusations. Thank you very much, Ambassador Mohib. Unfortunately, that's all we have time for today. No, no, this is not all the time that we have, because Zelensky is one second, hold on, Zelensky. Please let him talk. Please let him talk. But stand in your own place and please talk. Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, please please please please please. Can everyone stay seated? Can everyone please stay seated? We are, we are a member of the Union Society and we are aware of the form of their house. Unfortunately. Mr. Zelensky is being celebrated right now around the world. I wish as an Afghan, I wish that I could be proud of you today. I wish those people that are standing outside, can be in this room. It could be in this room together with us, celebrating the resistance. Okay, I as a young Afghan, looked up to you. I did when you stood up in Jalalabad last year, and you said, I will die, I want to be hanged right here. Okay, and you had this, this, this, that momentum. People were, people looked at you and said, okay, we have someone here, okay, who is from this new generation, who has suffered from all of this war there, and who will go there and fight for us. But three weeks later, four weeks later, you left. You came to London, we spoke to DBC Harttook, just like this year, and he said, you prefer the chaos of Afghanistan over the calm of London. I believed you. I said, look, I saw myself as a coward because, thank you, when I believed I had a duty to my character. Honourable Remember, I think you've made your question. Do you want to give a chance for him to respond really quickly? Honourable member, Honourable member, the people that you... Honourable member... The people that you've got along here with today are looking more worse than we do. Because this is... I'm going to take a seat, please. Can you please look at the camera? Tell my family, tell the earth of Afghanistan. that what you have done to the people of Afghanistan, okay? To your part, I know that people have, I know Sayalam, my Syyafis from my district and he was asked by that everyone else. Okay? Let you let him talk. Right, I need you to say that for yours and say sorry, Satan Parsing, what place, say it in Pashto for God. I'll give him a chance. Please, could you sit down and let him respond? Afghanistan. Afghanistan. Could you engage with that? Engage. Exactly. Exactly this question. Okay. Exactly this question. How long has the war in Ukraine been going for? Three and a half months? The Afghans fought the same oppressor in Afghanistan. For 10 years, a million Afghans died. everything we had was diminished, our culture was attacked, our institutions were attacked, we fought three months compared to four decades of conflict, this conflict creates more conflict. I will tell you, last year, I'm part of a cohort of young leaders across the globe that gather a time to talk about discussions. Everybody's agenda was COVID. from industry to governments the biggest concern they had was COVID is what is infecting everything they had in their lives you know where COVID was on the agenda for Afghanistan not even in the top 10 it wasn't even every crisis gave more crisis every day we woke up it wasn't just fighting the Taliban we were we were in immediate conflict not conflict but in a difficult position with the country that was paying for our security forces, the United States, our own allies were telling us that our enemy has changed in that we are an impediment to peace. We had to fight because we couldn't afford to pay our starving people. People were giving us $5 billion a year to fight a war but weren't ready to give us $50 million to pay for the food of those because of the climate, what's the, what's the one? were drought because of drought. They weren't prepared to do that. We had all of what we were to doing. In 10 years, my friend, you will think back, that decision saved the lives of millions of Afghans. You think fighting is easy, you know, or fighting is hard, not fighting is harder. Everybody in Afghanistan knows and can fight back, okay? But it's when we need to come to, to end that war. end it when it's no longer it's no longer going to serve and we have the chance or choice to be able to do so okay thank you thank thank you very much order order order I don't remember I do not have to ask for you to be removed from the event please order I'd like to first of all thank many of us in this room who have respected the forms of House and respected our civil society rights to debate. I understand how emotional this is for many people, but of course we commend that the University of the Union Society, it's holding this event today, allowing people to express themselves, allowing people to hold people that want to ask questions from to account. Unfortunately, that's all we have time for today and I'd like to thank and I'd like to thank all of you for attending to this event and finally like to thank Ambassador Mohib for joining us.
