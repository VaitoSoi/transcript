 Well, Mr President, I've been listening carefully to the speeches on both sides of the debate, and I had the unworthy suspicion that some of the speeches from this side of the debate were plants from the other side of the debate. I was struck, and particularly by the young man who told us that, well, he was here speaking for Scottish independence, because it would make England richer, get rid of these impoverished Scots and make England richer. Now, of course, he was in jest, at least I think he was. But there is a point here. What I can't understand, just in terms of logic, not as a politician. What I can't understand, if the people who pronounce this argument that somehow the impoverished Scots are subsidised by the magnificence of the London Treasury, then why isn't his argument more current among unionist politicians at Westminster? Why are they so absolutely determined to hang on to Scotland at all costs if they really believed it would be a massive boost to England to get shot at the Scots? Yes, of course. something that perhaps the nationals would be well so qualified by quite a name. Yes, I did. Indeed, I do. I just haven't heard any positive arguments for the Union tonight. What I've heard instead is that how Scotland is somehow not a real nation. I mean, let's forget the thousand years of Scottish history as an independent nation before the Treaty of Union. let's forget that Scotland, along with Wales, is one of the most distinctive national entities in Europe, such a geographical integrity for the last 700 years or so. Somehow, it's a subject that would be worthy of partition. Can I say to the honourable gentleman that partition hasn't worked particularly well in these islands in the recent past, and it would be foolish to try and apply it to Scotland? But no, what you said was somehow Scotland as a nation didn't have the right of self-determination because it wasn't a real nation. Well, let me tell this Augustus Assembly, if Scotland's not a real nation, then there's hardly a real nation on earth as every characteristic as a bona fide nation, no better than any other nation, but entitled to the rights of any, no thank you, entitled to the rights of any other nation. Now, Finley proposing, and what a fine maiden speech it was to a year. You've been acting the Black Watch tart in, Finley. As I remember, a regiment formed to put down a colonial insurrection in Egypt, if I recall correctly. And you were very kind to us. There was no ducks out tonight. And well done on your maiden speech. But Alec Cole Hamilton, you started with a fine tribute to Nicola Sturgeon. And then you went on to suggest that somehow Nicola Sturgeon was in a community. continuum with Donald Trump. Now let me stand here at the Oxford Union and defend Nicholas Sturgeon. Whatever differences we have had, Nicholas Sturgeon is not in a politician on a continuum with Donald Trump. In fact, I've actually beaten Donald Trump in court three times as he tried to get a win demonstrator moved from a yes and course. Well, perhaps the difference is that every time I've been in court of one, so that's something perhaps this fair-minded body would call into account. But I was Cole Hamilton made this argument that somehow those who support Scottish independence are Johnny come lately to the cause of Europe. Now, okay, the SMP adopted the Scotland and Europe cause about 1995, which is a fair time ago and have consistently pursued it, as has the other aspects in Alapa argues for EFTA and for rejoining the single market, they look at Scottish independence within a European context. What Alec Co-Hamilton failed to tell us is that the Liberal Democrats, one of the few consistent themes of that party over the last 50 years, has been its pro-European agenda. But what is the policy of the Liberal Democrats today? Is it to rejoin the European Union at the earliest opportunity to get back into that magnificent union across the continent? No, that's not what they're any longer arguing for. So ill-behoves Alec O'Hamilton to tell us that somehow those who argue for Scottish independence or Johnny come lately to the European cause when they have deserted it precisely at the moment when a poll shows that 58% of the UK population are now in favour of rejoining? Yes, of course. The Honourable President is known by the Scots the World Open for his disinformation. We've heard earlier about how he's actually been successful in monetising that disinformation on a certain state about media channels. But actually, I think he will listen to my word will know that if you cut me, I believe you. I am a European to my goodness. How are I am I? Is this the point of information to the speaker? We want to see the United Kingdom walking in step with our European names. We have to. Please make the Honourable Member make a question to the speaker or leave a seat. I will finish with this. I feel that considering that the ad-com. Can I have an intervention on your understanding? intervention. I'm not immediately rejoining. The result of that referendum, something the SNP and the other arm would do well to emulate. So the bit that said not immediately rejoining, that's the bit that tells us the Liberal Democrats are no longer. advocating, rejoining European Union. How, like a Liberal Democrat, for the first time in recent political history, they've got majority opinion on their side, and they choose that moment to desert the European cause. And as for these barred remarks about a programme that was broadcast in RT and editorially independent, I well remember the last programme, it was the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine before I withdrew the programme. And I remember that interview, in particular, I was interviewing, Sir Vince Cable, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats. And let me suggest to you that Vince Cable, who I believe is a considerable politician, perhaps even more considerable than Alec Cole Hamilton, would not have appeared on a propaganda outlet as described. Now, I want to make, as we have done from this side, the positive case. I believe that it is true, the world over, that nobody runs a country better than the country. the people of that country themselves. I think self-determination, independence is the natural state of countries. Alec Cole Hamilton tried to suggest it was something which was old hat, that was something that doesn't exist. Well, when the United Nations was formed in 1945, it had almost 50 members. It now has almost 200 members. The tide of history over that time has gone in favour of self-determination, in favour of independence. And today I actually thought I would get through an Oxford Union debate without hearing the word empire. But we actually heard from one of the proponents against the resolution tonight that the British Empire was something we should be celebrated. I think the Oxford Union is moved beyond the imperial face. And it's time for this union to embrace the idea that countries across the world have embraced the idea of self-determination and independence. The second way. Oh, I've missed a bit about the incontable evils. But let me tell you this. There's like 50 countries have become independent from London since the Second World War. And in my time as in politics and public life, I think I met the High Commissioners for every single one of these countries. Rich and small, big, poor, prosperous, a whole variety of countries. And you know what the one thing they had in common? Not one single one of them said we're going to come back under Westminster rule. Not one single one of them. Now, why is it? And the young lady incidentally, no thank you. The one lady incidentally who said that she was looking to articulate the case, I thought it actually articulated it superbly. When she said, what are the unionist forces frightened on to deny Scotland its right of self-determination? And self-determination is not a static thing. If a result of one election determined everything, then the Liberal Democrats would never hope to get back to the glories of Lloyd George. They want to have another go at another election. That's what self-determination is like. People are entitled at each election to make new choices. The referendum in Scottish independence was in 2014. People who were eight years old would get to vote in a new referendum in Scotland on self-determination. It's a continuum. It's not a static thing. There are two major events through my political lifetime that tell you why devolution is not enough. Firstly, that was the war in Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of people died, billions exerted in treasure and money and wastage of resources, and a tragedy which denially upset the international. order of affairs across and undermine the United Nations. That was something that Scotland, in the devolution age, could do nothing to stop because it was determined at Westminster. The second was, on the last time I spoke in this Oxford Union, was the Brexit debate, as Ms. Hammond Shake had told us. 62% of Scotland voted to be part of the European Union, to stay in that union. And the costs and the consequences of that are, in this country of England as well as the country of Scotland. But how would the people of this union, the people of this country feel if they were suffering these consequences against the votes that they had cast at the ballot box? When Finley proposed the resolution, he talked about the problems of the Health Service in Scotland, and he was looking for some sort of reason why these problems were connected with this debate tonight. One of the biggest problems in the Health Service is the inability to discharge people from hospitals into care homes. What's the key problem in care homes? It's shortage of staff. What is the key reason for that shortage of staff is that we're no longer in the single market. We're no longer have the available staff who've been so valuable in our health service and care service over the last generation. That's why it matters to be able to control your own affairs and to make sure that you make a contribution to the world. We on this side of the house have nothing negative to say about the opponents of the proposition. This is about Scotland's potential as a nation, the ability that has been demonstrated the world over time and time again, to take control of your own resources, use the skills and ingenuity of your people to make a better future. I'll never accept the idea that Scotland is better than any other nation, but equally I'll never accept the idea that were any worse. Let's take responsibility for our own affairs, full responsibility to run our country better and to make our own distinctive contribution to the world. Thank you.
