 First, I must thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the immense privilege of speaking in this debate tonight. Your commitment to championing free speech is honourable, and it has led to the many interesting debates to come this term. From debating whether world culture has gone too far, whether or not we should boycott the World Cup, and of course the legalisation of drugs. These are all debates very close to your heart, and I should look forward to hearing the speakers. And I should look forward to hearing the speakers arguing their case. Members, tonight, in the first debate of Mickham this term, 2022, we are continuing the Union's esteemed tradition of asking whether or not we have confidence in the government. As you can imagine, arranging this debate has been rather difficult. When we first started planning it, it was a completely different government that we thought the House would anticipate to have no confidence in. Since then, we've had mass resignations, a Tory leadership election, drastic changes to the fortunes of the economy, to top it all, the death of the country's longest-serving monarch, a permanence which helped sustain people through difficult times. And members, I'm going to be honest with you. It's not going great. Frankly, no one can claim that the attention surrounding the government is in any way, shameful form, overwhelmingly positive. And I think doing so would simply just be delusional. With Labour currently operating with a 33% lead in the polls, unless this chamber tonight, packed with Oxford students and some miraculous ground turn out to be exceptionally right-wing, then I think side opposition faces a truly heraickean challenge. It is thus not my argument tonight that the job done by the government thus far has in any way, shape, or form, been brilliant. But it is, rather, to demonstrate why it is only through a bold change of direction that the economic status grow, something I believe only the current government are capable of, that the UK can be saved from the prospect of a deep and lasting recession. We need change. I'm sure that the proposition tonight will invite you all to envision a world in which the contemporary economic and social landscape is the result of government action and government action alone. But let's be clear. This is a situation which the current administration has inherited, which originated outside of the government's influence. Strikes, economic stagnation, heating turned off across the country, a landscape of general pessimism and despair. If you add the war in Ukraine and the aftermath of a global pandemic, you may just take the leap from the 1970s to the 2020s. Thus, this is above all a time where we must seek political stability. If not, we risk the prospect of further economic insecurity. Members, for this debate tonight to have any meaning whatsoever, a force on side proposition to offer an alternative vision of what the government is currently providing. It is not that the burden of the opposition to not only criticize the government, but also precisely tell us what a different government would do differently and how such a government would be compositioned. Members, it's easy to criticize a different game altogether to act. but before I convince you all, and perhaps even myself, to vote opposition tonight, then it falls upon me to introduce speakers of side proposition. You've just heard from Jenny Graham Bradley, a second year historian, a Harper College, and most famously the founder of Oxfrette. Now, I don't want to roast Jenny too hard tonight because she's such a lovely person, and she's also such an incredible hard worker on committee. I mean, her creative efforts of reaching out to speakers are truly admirable. And just to illustrate this, when in an effort to get Carrie Johnson to come and speak in this debate tonight, she was not distraught by our inability to find a contact for her. She persevered, and it's only because of her work that I'm able to read to you guys the opening line of her email. Dear Mr. Boris Johnson, I hope this email finds you well. Please, may you pass on this invitation to your wife? As you can tell, Carrie is sadly not with us tonight, but I put that down to her busy schedule rather than Jenny's lack of effort. We should also hear from Richard Bergen, a Labour MP who studied English literature at Cambridge University, serving during his time as chair of the Cambridge University Labor Club. Mr. Bergen's recent political career is very much shaped. by this idea of confidence. In 2019, Mr. Bergen spoke in this very same debate, also then arguing that we ought not to have confidence in the government. Surely afterwards, his own party lost confidence in him. Reject him first from his bid as deputy leader of the party before he was immediately shacked from the shirt of cabinet when Keir Stamer took over the party. It's great to have him here tonight because I'm sure that by now he's got a solid understanding of what confidence means. Next up we have Gina Miller, a business woman and activist, perhaps most known as the initiator of the famous Miller cases against the government. Shortly after her legal endeavours, though, she, and with great success, I might add, decided to launch her own political party. In an avidly anticipated launch ceremony, I believe a grand total of two accredited members of the press arrived, and I can see that. see here today that we have represented some three newspapers here and we also got a packed chamber so be a bit gentle michela she she's not used to these kinds of crowds um um mr president these are your guests and they are most welcome There is a war being fought over our economy. In the press, in the benches of the House of Commons, and now, tonight in this chamber. And to understand this differing of opinion, we must first comprehend the economic strategy of the new government. And so let's leave misconceptions and stereotypes out the door, and let's take a closer look of what was actually in the budget on non-conceived. by the Chancellor. First, the introduction of a cap on energy prices aimed at relieving the staggering cost of energy for both households and consumers. Secondly, a cut in the proposed national insurance rise of 1.25%. This will place more money into the hands of ordinary people at a time when the cost of living is increasing like never before. Thirdly, cutting stamp duty for properties with a valuation of under Â£425,000. This proposal will ease the burden of first-time bias, eager to get on the property ladder, during a time in which the interest rate of mortgages are going up. Tonight, the proposition will no doubt tell you that the increase in the cost of borrowing is the result of the budget itself. However, a long streak of historic low-level interest rates was an unsustainable bubble which inevitably would burst anyway, with or without government intervention. These aren't measures from a selfish, Tory government obsessively focus on returnsment, but large-scale spending commitments all aimed at putting more money and more choice in the hands of the consumer. This is vital during a time when most per people's personal finances are tightening. Since the financial crisis of 2008, productivity has hoovered in the UK around half a percentage point. percentage points. The United Kingdom has one of the lowest growth rates in the G7. And this government understands that there are structural disadvantages in the British economy, which has allowed both economic growth and productivity to remain at a standstill. Compared this with the years 1979 to 1996, when the aftershocks of a radical reformist government, unafraid to carry out the fiscal reforms necessary, even if they seemed unpopular at the time, managed to boost productivity upwards to 3%. Members, these aren't empty statistics. They mean something. They have detrimental consequences for the material well-being of all people across this country. Through reductions in corporate tax and creative policies such as investment zones, this government is acknowledging the need for change. Denied. tonight you will be no doubt given a simplistic explanation by the proposition that this is the action of the government which has led to the recent decrease in the value of the pound they will no doubt claim that the government's budget thanked the pound causing short-term confidence in the british economy to fall However, currency traders selling of pound is no proper indication of the current performance of the British economy. Exated on short-term market fluctuations, traders thrive in betting against economies. This is simply how they make money. Far from being analysts of economic performance, they pin currencies against each other, assessing the relative valiance of currencies, not across months. but across seconds. I ask you, are these three of the people to look for for insights into how the economy of the UK is performing? Looking beyond the economy, no argument from side proposition tonight will hinder the fact that this is the most diverse cabinet in British political history. Whilst a Conservative Party has just elected its third female Prime Minister, the leader of the opposition remains a white man from North London. Far from conforming to a Tory stereotype of inherited privilege, the people of this government are living exemplars of the values they wish to instill in society, that have hard work and getting on in life. As a child of recently arrived immigrants, the Chancellor, Mr. Corsi-Corting, want a scholarship to Eaton. This in turn allowed him to take a first from Trinity, Cambridge, and yet another scholarship to Harvard and a PhD in economic health. history. Denied. I'm having a hard enough time as it is, guys. Come on. Similarly, Listrust, a self-proclaimed Yorkshire lass, attributed her admissions to Merton College, Oxford. Due to her early enthusiasms for maths, through her hard-eared efforts, she enjoyed the privilege of reading PPE at this prestigious university, and also holding the distinguished position as Merton College rep for the Oxford Union. Members, side opposition suffers today from the obvious disadvantage of defending a government which has only been in office for a month. To complicate matters further, half of this period saw politics pause for national mourning. It is therefore only fair for the opposition tonight to locate this government in conjunction with the success of the previous Conservative government. During the pandemic, the government delivered one of the most successful vaccine rollout schemes in the world. This meant that for the British people, they were able to open up society again, months ahead of countries on the continent. Ladies and gentlemen, there can be no denying that we live in uncertain same concerns. But there is in no way that we can cement these and move past them unless a drastic change, of course, is taken. Despite the shortcomings of the government and the shortcomings of the global situation more broadly, how we to build trust that? that which is so sorely needed from further chaos and speculation. And Mr. President, at the very least, if there is one thing that side proposition cannot dispute tonight, then surely it is thus, that the Prime Minister does not lack confidence in herself. Thank you very much. Thank you.
