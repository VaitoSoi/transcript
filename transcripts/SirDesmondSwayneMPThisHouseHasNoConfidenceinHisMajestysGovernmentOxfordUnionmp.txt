 Mr President, I think there is one thing on which we can all agree this evening, and that is that it is a privilege and an honour to debate under your chairmanship. And though I am delighted to be here, I am somewhat surprised. surprised first that there aren't more illustrious spokesmen on behalf of Her Majesty's government perhaps it's the polls and we three are the last men standing but more surprised even because of the excoriating critique to which I have subjected this government's actions over the last three years because this has been a thin time for those of us who believe that the answer to every problem is not necessarily more government, who believe that on the whole, governments do not do things well. And therefore, the less we expect them to do on our behalf, the better governed we shall be. Those of us who believe that the real driver, if you will forgive me, the real drivers of progress of progress, the real drivers of progress and prosperity are individual initiative enterprise and effort. Now, the whole thrust of policy and development has been in the opposite direction, with an increase in the scope of government, and of course, a commensurate increase in its costs in the burden of taxation. And Boris told us that the government was going to put its arms around the nation and protect us from the pandemic. I do not doubt for one moment the motives, the good motives that he had. But the consequence was a huge increase in state power. We were confined to our homes. We were told whom we meet and the circumstances in which we might meet them. We were told what we may do. We were told even what we must wear. The consequences of those disastrous policies become ever more apparent daily as we see the impact of them. How can I stand here and express confidence in the authors of those policies? Well, let me direct you to a treasury of wisdom, a treasury that requires greater and deserves greater study, particularly for those of you who might fancy yourselves as philosophers. Of course, I refer to the words of piglet as recorded by A.A. Milne in Winnie the Pooh. And if I may quote, Picklet in conversation with Winnie the Pooh and he said No is a very big word Accordingly Accordingly the framers of this motion this evening have placed a very big bar in front of those who would propose it a very large bar, a very high bar. Because if even in some residual area of your subconscious, you retain even a grain of confidence in this government, the motion falls because no is a very big word. It means nothing. It means zilch. So how is it? How is it that I can retain that grain of confidence, given all I've done and said over the last three years? Well, it comes down to this. It comes down to what we might describe as hang on to nurse for fear of something worse. It comes down to what Churchill described in that appalling piece of English grammar that sometimes we have to face a choice between the least worst of the alternatives. That's the position that we're in. We have to make in this imperfect world a judgment between what might be the least less eligible course in which to presume. Now, when I think of the enormities that were imposed upon us, and I really do mean the enormities, we were separated as if we were laboratory rats we had policemen ordering people out of their front gardens to go back indoors we had a police chief saying that he had ordered his officers to inspect the shopping to see that only essentials were being purchased we had a police force poison we had a police force poison an area of outstanding natural beauty in order to deter people from going to see it. We had walkers being watched by police drones. We had members of my constituency ringing up to dobb in their neighbours for having gone out for two walks on a day or to have spent too much time in their allotment. We had two women fined for being out walking whilst carrying a cup of coffee. And when I railed and voted against these enormities, I got no support from the opposition. On the contrary, their complaint is that these restrictions on our liberty had not been severe enough, had not been long enough, had not been frequent enough. and they resisted every attempt to withdraw from them. They wanted them prolonged. Let that be a measure of their values and what we might expect from them. And now, when in these last few weeks we have suddenly found ourselves under what must be authentically, the most liberal, even libertarian administration in two generations. I would be the first, who are determined to actually reverse this, reduce the burden of government, reduce our taxes, liberate enterprise. I would be the first to admit that it would be an understatement to suggest that it hadn't been a very rocky start. but I salute the Prime Minister in her ambition. It is a very different ambition from the only plausible alternative, namely the Labour Party. They have a different set of values. They have a different agenda and a different ambition, and they would lead us in a very different direction towards a collectivist path. Now, there are two years in which this government might continue, and I suggest that the Prime Minister should be given a chance. Bear in mind, we celebrate yesterday the lowest unemployment for 50 years, and every single Labour government has left unemployment higher at the end of its term that it inherited at the first. forgive me. I suggest that she should be given her chance. Comrades! I am with piglet on this one. Remember, no is a very, very big word. Thank you.
