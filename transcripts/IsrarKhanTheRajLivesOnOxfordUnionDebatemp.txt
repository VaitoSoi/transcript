 Now, the case for the proposition is the the recent barrister himself, PhD in law student, the one and only Israel Khan. Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to speak on a topic that I am very passionate about. Ayushiyah was very smart. She gave you a blooded history of the British Raj so that in comparison, their legacy would not be that bad. But that does not mean that the British Raj does not live. The legacy does not have to be as bloody as the history was. And also, Ayushy, I'm quite confident that my speech will be more stable than my career. Mr. President, members of the House, almost 75 years have passed since the Raj, the British Raj, left the current, the Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. after ruling the region for more than 190 years. While Britain may have left the region physically, its legacy remains dominant in every aspect of our lives. To quote the historian Sashi Tarur, the effects of colonialism do not end when the last troops depart. They linger like a disease, festering in the body, politics. and in the minds of the formerly oppressed. I'll be making two arguments to support this notion. And IEYi she already gave you an indication of the first one that Raj was about exploitation where the current system is not. And I will tell you how our entire current economic system is still based on exploitation and is a legacy of what Raj created. Then I will argue how the Raj's system still lives through the minds, through our institutions and through our education system. But I'll start with the last point first because I prepared that more. There are three patrons common across the former colonies. Firstly, the idealization of the West and the white men. Secondly, the inheritance of institutions such as the police, bureaucracy, judiciary, military and the education system from the route. And thirdly, the ruling elite and the dynastic politics which are inherited from the issue. But in order to understand how the Raj lived through these mechanisms, it is essential to also understand the methods through which a handful of British ruled millions of Indians. I'll not go too deep in history. But briefly. Just a point of information. Is it possible to speak closer to the mic and not away from it? Yes, Mr. President, of course. Members of the House colonization is not just conquest of the land and resources, but that of the mind. Among other things, what the British did was used soft power of imperiality complex to control and rule the Indian people. This was based on creating a myth of the civilization mission so that the masses believed that the Raj came to educate and civilize them instead of polluting and plundering their economies of trillions of dollars. But most importantly, the Raj rule depended on the educational system designed to create respect and admiration for the British Raj and contempt and hate for our own society and ancestors. Through this education system, they also created a class of native people who were used for the swift rule of the British Raj in their colonies. talked in detail about McCauley's quote about the class of the people. And McCauley, that Thomas McCauley, was behind this policy in his 1835 minutes on education in India, created a policy which had a lasting impact on colonial attitudes, encouraging a sense of cultural superiority. British education was and is considered superior to the one which had been prevailing in that part of the world since ancient times. and times. To quote the famous Macaulay, he shed down indigenous languages such as Sanskrit, Arabic and Urdu, and commented that. A single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole literature of India and Arabia. Macaulay intended his English educated elites to be loyal to Britain. Instead of creating a nationhood, he created a a class system. Now let's connect it with post-independence. Post-independence, the legacy continues. The new states inherited a legacy of handful feudal lords and barricades. These feudal lords carried out where the British left. In terms of Pakistan, the state continued to be run by either a series of military dictators or pseudo-democratic governments consistent of feudal dynasties. But the most lingering effect to this day of McCauley's policy can be seen in the status quo is in our education system. Continuing up to the categories of education. Private schools for the elites, public schools for the masses. Now McCauley's Minutes had a substantial part to play and it's since he purposely condemned the indigenous languages. As a result, today the elitist natives started enrolling their children in private English medium schools that were initiated to cater to the needs of these upper echelons of the society or started their kids to this country or to other foreign universities taking pride in the fact that their children have studied from English universities. Members of the house, no offense. But myself and many sitting here are apart. product of Macaulay's legacy, a legacy which continues to perpetuate itself when we go back to our countries with an inherent sense of superiority just because we have studied from Oxford. The same university has produced the leaders of East India Company and date of the British Raj. Pakistan is home to six linguistic groups and 58 smaller ones. To this day, the native languages are not fully included. incorporated into school syllabus. Instead, English as a foreign language is given more importance than the mother tongues and national languages. My native language is Pashto. I have studied in Pakistan for 16 years. I'm more worse in English than my own native language because I was never taught Pashto in my school. Now, literature is a powerful form of knowledge. And colonial rule in India painted a false picture of the West as a superior culture, causing a state of cultural amnesia. In a way, it made us ashamed of our own past. We are unable to properly define tradition and modernity. Instead, what we witness is artificial modernism based on Western attitudes and ideals. I usually tell my white friends that if you ever struggle to find a job in this country, welcome to Pakistan, you will be an instant celebrity. an instant celebrity. Now, this legacy also continues in the form of institutions such as judiciary and the British laws. In terms of laws, the British laws to this day rule Pakistan. Mr. Mir will speak in details with examples, and he must speak about Ali Vazir, a recent case of how the British legacy lingers in Pakistan. But I'll briefly touch on it. Pakistan's criminal law known as the Pakistan Penal Court, was enacted in 1860 by the British Raj, at a time by Macaulay. To this day, this law is enacted. Macaulay basically regulates Pakistan crimes. The same way, the Code of Civil Procedure from 1908 still exists. The Income Tax Act from 1920 to the contractor from 1870 to the list goes on and on. Of course, some minor modifications are made, but these are largely superficial and relate to definitions and terminology, but nothing substantial. But then the argument goes, as Pakistan's legal system, why do not the politicians change it? It's in their hands. Of course they can be changed, but then why do they not? Because the mindset and the belief that British laws are superior and provides better structure continues to dominate our mindset. And it is through that mindset that the British structure has continued to run into, to run the country of Pakistan. I'll briefly now touch upon the economic exploitation in quickly two minutes. Yes, the British exploited the country, they plundered. But the current economic structure is actually based on what the British left to the world. Today, under globalization, what we see is free trade, free market economy. Before, that was under the ideals of plunders. and exploitation. Now what happens is that developing countries are used to enrich developed countries, cheap labor, cheap resources, cheap capitalism is provided and the outflow comes here for every dollar that is being given in charity to developing countries. Twenty-eight dollars goes back to developed countries and this is based on the very system of free trade that was incorporated during the time of the British legacy. And I will conclude with this quote from Montgomery Martin, author of the first complete history of the British colonies in five large volumes said, and I quote, I have been impressed with a conviction that India has suffered most unjustly in her trade, not merely with England, but with all other countries by reason of the outcry of free trade on the part of England without permitting India to free trade herself. So the very system that we in developing countries employ is a legacy in itself of how the British ruled India in the first place. For those reasons, I urge you to propose the motion and to accept the fact that the British legacy still continues. Thank you very much. You know,
