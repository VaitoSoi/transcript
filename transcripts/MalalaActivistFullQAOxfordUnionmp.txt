 Good evening, everyone. Wow, quite a packed chamber. Welcome to tonight's much, much anticipated event. Tonight we'll be joined by Malala Yousafzai. Malala is a Pakistani activist for women's education, author, and human rights advocate who has been dubbed Pakistan's most prominent citizen. In 2014, she was made the youngest ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate at 17 years old and is the first Pashtun to receive this accolade. She graduated from Lady Margaret Hall in 2020 and has been a global icon inspiring millions of young people around the world. It gives me great pleasure and an honor to welcome Malala Yousafzai into our chamber tonight. Firstly, such an honor, firstly sitting here, and I've never seen a more electric crowd in this chamber in the last two, three years. It's such a great honor to have you back in Oxford. I mean, you left yourself only a few years ago. You graduated a few years ago from Oxford. And one thing that I was thinking about, and I think a lot of people must have thought about this, that it must have been quite different, quite odd, being such a high profile person, like going through the same university experiences. So essentially, like, how did you find the university experience and balancing that with your activism, like, studies, you get essay crisis every week, essentially. So did you feel a lot of pressure on day to day, or how was it? That's a lot of questions, but first of all, I'm so honored to be here at Oxford Union. Yes, I was having a really good time here at university. I visited the union so many times. I sat almost in every corner of this building up there, there, there, here, left, right, everywhere. Just trying all the seats. I said, which one gives you the best view? So, yeah, I think these front ones are good. So I, you know, I started studying here in 2017 and then graduated in 2020, the first COVID, you know, class. And I had the best time here because I was able to meet some of the most amazing people. I was able to hear some of the most amazing people. I was able to hear some inspiring leaders, change makers, policy makers, most in this same very building. And I also made amazing friends in my college. And I think one of the best things was like I went to LMAH, Lady Margaret Hall. So that's the, yes. You know, it's probably the best college here. So I'm sure the president would agree. I completely agree. But I mean, also, this was all pre-planned. Malala voted for me so I could become president and invite her back to Oxford. But anyways, we don't talk about that. But what would you say, like you missed the most about Oxford? I just want to know a bit about how your time was at here. I'm curious because I wasn't here. I'll be honest. I do not look back. I always try to focus on the next things in my life. When I graduated from university, there were just so many things to reflect on, all the good memories, all the difficult times, those essay crisis, those moments of nearly giving up and deciding, like, this is too hard. This is too challenging. And because I was doing activism and so much work outside, it was quite challenging to manage all the work together. and you know you all know that just meeting you know all the essay deadlines and finishing those reading lists like that's nearly impossible so so it's it's not an easy time here but I try to carry those beautiful memories with me the time I spent with my friends all the giggles and laughters we had and this time we spent in the beautiful libraries gardens and But I think, you know, there's so much you learn here, but also at the same time you realize that, you know, Oxford at the same time has limits as well. It has, you know, it does not truly reflect the world outside. So you have met amazing and incredible people. Stay in touch with them and make the best friends. And go forward and try to bring your vision into action, try to make it a little bit of. reality, I'm really grateful that I have a group of friends who are doing so much amazing projects. They are raising awareness. They are empowering other people. They are bringing new innovative ways to create change. And they are ensuring that other people also get equal opportunities to be able to study and to have a better future for themselves. So that is something that I really am grateful for, that I made amazing friends. And I'm sure they stay with you forever. Yeah. No, absolutely. And I think it's quite an enjoyable time. I wish I had a tenorx when you were here as well. It would have been quite an honor, a story to tell your grandchildren perhaps. But also, you mentioned activism in that this is a big part of your life. And you started campaigning at a very early age. In 2008, in fact, when you were 11-year-old, you started calling out the Taliban for preventing women from going to schools. This was at a time when Taliban had control of most rural parts of Pakistan. With the world seeing an 11-year-old stand up to this Taliban force, a sort of new confidence was born in a lot of young people that always felt like something is wrong, but never sort of could stand up to it. What was the moment, what was that particular moment, that at 11 years old that you just decided, okay, enough is enough. I'm going to have to do something about it myself. We all have heard about the big wars around the world, including the Cold War and the Soviet invasion and what was happening in Afghanistan. But those stories do not just stay limited to the news headlines. Those stories are actually impacting people's lives on the ground. And that radicalization that was happening, that was happening there for decade, eventually flew into Swat Valley, which was my hometown. And in 2007, a group declared themselves the Pakistani Taliban, and they said that they would impose their own Islamic system, a so-called Islamic system where they wanted women to stay limited in their houses. They did not believe in girls' education. They did not believe in women doing any jobs. and they did not want women to even be on the streets going to market. So women were banned. You would go to a street and there would be a banner outside a shop which says women are not allowed. Schools were closed. At that time, I was 10, 11 years old, and I was very passionate about education. I wanted to study. I wanted to become a doctor. But things change too early. and the Taliban announced a ban on girls' education. I could not go to school. My friends could not go to school. And at that time, I had no option. I had to speak out because I could not imagine living in that extremism and terrorism forever. And some people were too scared to speak out because they were not putting their lives on threat and they were not putting their lives in danger. And they were worried that something would happen. But at the same time, silence was also costly. Silence meant that things would continue as they were and nothing was going to change. So my belief was that in order to change things, you have to speak out because things don't change themselves. Someone has to take that bold step and do it. And at that time, when you are only 11 years old, you don't even know what to do. So I started my activism with volunteering to speak to local media channels, newspapers, TVs, and also the national and international media channels as well. And that included the New York Times and BBC and CNN and others who were just coming into the valley and trying to ask people to say something about what was happening. And my dad and I and a few other activists were willing to say the truth. Speaking the truth is really important. And for me, it was simply just telling my story that this is a reality that is happening right now in this part of the world where girls are denied their right to education, where peace is just taken away from us. So this is where my activism started, but since then, you know... It's exceptional because it's been a long time that, you know, a long time ago that you started, and it has only been going, getting bigger and bigger and you're making more impact on a wider scale. Just like in terms of that you started at the age of 11 and of course later on you got busier and busier with things, have you ever found it difficult to sort of keep focused? I can imagine that it's sometimes sort of easy to almost slip into the influential culture. How do you keep the activism like effective once you've got on a platform? How do you keep focus on the goal itself, something that you really believe in? I became more focused on my campaign for girls' education because I realized that girls' education is not just an issue in one part of Pakistan, but it is a global issue. There is a global emergency for girls' education. Right now, 130 million girls do not have access to education. More than 20 million were at risk of dropping out because of the COVID-19 pandemic and many girls are at risk of never returning to their schools because of climate related events including floods and droughts because of which their schools are directly damaged or they get displaced and they stay away from their schools for a long period of time and then there are other terrible things that are happening including conflicts and wars when we look at the case of Afghanistan gull's secondary education is currently banned by the Taliban so So when you look at the reality of the world and what's happening with the education of the future generation, it tells you that we cannot just stop and not do anything and just keep looking at it. It's really important that we do something for it to ensure that all children can have this basic human right, which is to be able to access education. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. And I think you mentioned a very important aspect. like the Afghanistan war that's going on right now, the Taliban regime has taken over. It's been a year since they took over. What was your response to the United States pulling out, as in what was your stance at that moment? I was actually in a hospital in the U.S., I was going through another surgery, still, like, healing the scars of one bullet from the Taliban. Imagine the bullets that the people of Afghanistan have taken. Imagine the bullets that people in Pakistan have even taken because of the terrorism and extremism. And it is really unfortunate how the name of Islam has been misused and exploited for personal reasons, and such radicalism has been spread. It's really important in this time that the world unites, and the world stands up to protect human rights of women, of girls, of people, and they ensure safety to each and everyone. In Afghanistan right now, you know, this is happening 20 years later once again, and this time things are different because women and girls have seen schools. They have seen what it means for women to be able to do work, to be able to get their education, to be able to feel empowered. And they cannot unsee that reality. They cannot see a different future for themselves right now. So they are out on the streets, on their roads, protesting for their rights. And that is something that gives me and women around the world hope that things will be a bit more different because of the pressure that they are building. And I hope that the international community defends the rights of Afghan women and girls. And they should ensure that the rights of women and girls are a non-negotiable condition for any conversation with the Taliban. And it's also important in this time that Muslim countries stand up and defend Gull's right to education because they clearly know that the Taliban are misusing the name of Islam. So it's really time for them to say that there are dozens of Muslim countries around the world. They do not prohibit women from going to schools or going to work. So it's really important that they make a clear statement that no one can use that, you know, No one can use the religion to literally impose a ban on women from working and girls from education. So it's really important that we keep pushing leaders and those in positions of power to take action in this time. Yeah, no, absolutely. And I think you're also, well, I've heard that you're working on alternative ways of educating these young girls and young people in general in Afghanistan. Firstly, I would like to just generally know a bit more, we'd like to just generally know a bit more about this project that you're doing. But also, isn't it, I wonder if it's difficult to implement with the Taliban regime in there, and how you make it work around that? Right now there are so many Afghan activists who are doing activism, they're finding alternative means of education as well. Some of the activists who we were supporting in Afghanistan are actually running the secret schools. They are teaching coding to girls. They're teaching computer skills to them. And we are also in conversation with other prominent figures there who are finding ways in which they can use television as a learning source for the Afghan kids. And they're using mobile apps and other means as well to ensure that children keep learning. But this is a challenging time. This is a challenging time because we know that alternative means can. maybe assist the kids in the short term, or, you know, they would work, you know, with the assistance of formal in-school education as well. And at the same time, there is also a huge concern that, you know, that the kids who are in the primary school are actually not receiving quality education. So there are many reports which shows that the Taliban are actually trying to change the curriculum and limit children's exposure to sciences and critical thinking. These are really important subjects, because when you take away some of these important subjects, it does not remain education. It sort of becomes an indoctrination, and we don't want that for children. Yeah, and I think we've seen that, like, it happened in Pakistan as well some time ago in that, you know, there is sort of informal education going on from the Taliban. But in Afghanistan, it's on more of central scale, now that they have a whole government by the Taliban. What do you foresee happening in this situation? One thing that I get a lot, and I think us, like, generally, individuals here wonder, what can we do to help in general? Like, you know, a lot of us feel that this is a very bad situation that those people are in, and wondering for ways that we could help out. Yeah, what would be your advice in that? I think in this time it's really important to go and talk to Afghan activists. And whichever country and cause and area you're worried about, go and talk to the people who are directly impacted by those problems. And you can join them and support them in their movement. And they will tell you how exactly you can support them. You can spread their message. You can raise more awareness about the issue. You can engage more friends and colleagues as well. you can invest in the work that they are doing and really stand with them because it's really, when you stand with them, they realize that they're not alone in this journey, that there are people who will be willing to support them. And here, you know, Oxford, I believe it's the best university in the world. So we have amazing people who can, you know, who cannot only provide, you know, sort of, advice, et cetera, but they can actually go there and provide innovative and creative solutions. They can bring their skills and expertise and knowledge and really go and help people to bring their ideas into action. So do go out and, you know, and use what you have. No, absolutely. And I think in these sort of situations, like a lot of the, a lot of people look up to institutions like the UN, which is supposed to sort of mediate the, you know, these things or alleviate these sort of problems. The UN has been increasingly called into question for the ability to make real change or sort of change the status code, things as they are. How effective do you think the UN's role is today? And do you think the UN does enough to firstly support young people in these countries? I mean, it might be a biased answer from you, since you know, I'm just, no, like I spoke at the UN when I was 16 years old and at that time I had no idea. you know, what was possible through that platform. And I have been very active in the advocacy that's done through the United Nations. And, you know, I studied IR as part of politics, so I can write, you know, a whole essay on this. But I'm not going to do that. I think, you know, I have to do a lot of, I have to do like a long reading for that. I'm not ready. But I will say that, you know, there's always potential in possibility through these big international forums and if enough people are willing to come forward they can make a significant change happen. We have good examples from the past as well. You know that when we are talking about gender equality and other issues we have seen a significant change. So it is possible that we can make a huge difference going forward as well. On the UN I would say it's really important for them to bring people who are directly impacted by the issues to the stage. They should not just be talking about, you know, people who are in poverty, who are impacted by gender discrimination, whose education is currently banned just in numbers and figures. They can bring them to the state, so why not do that? And this year, when I spoke at the UN, I took girls with me to the stage, and I insisted that, you know, that they have to speak. you know, I'm currently 25, so I would not call myself like a young girl anymore. And they need more young people there. And young people are just doing so much incredible work. They are doing activism. They want change in their schools, in their workplace, in their community, in their society. And they can advise you on what needs to be done for them. and Vanessa Nakata, climate activist, she spoke there, Ukrainian activist spoke there, and Sumaya and Afghan activists spoke there. So I hope that, you know, in that room, the leaders were able to hear directly from the girls how their decisions were going to impact them and how their inaction was going to impact them directly. Sometimes these things at the UN and other big institutions takes such a long time, it becomes so complicated, and sometimes for good reasons, but at the same time, you realize people are suffering, like, every day. So sometimes quick action is needed. You know, when you look at what's happening in Afghanistan, girls have been out of school for more than a year now, and if it becomes two years, three years, four years, many of those girls will never be able to complete their education. And that makes a huge difference in your life. When you're not able to complete your education, you miss on so many opportunities that education would have given you. So I hope that they take immediate action, and I personally will be using my role to push for that. No, absolutely. I think that sounds fantastic in that I completely agree with the point about bringing these people who have been firsthand affected by these problems, because it makes it more real the problem. to you. It's more human. It's the human form right there. Usually we talk about it in figures. We like poverty exists in this level, et cetera, et cetera. But yeah, that's a very sort of an interesting point that the UN perhaps should consider, and big institutions in general. But similarly moving towards sort of problems with not just girls' education, but sort of like a problem with women's freedom. And like Iran, for instance, recently, there there are problems going on with women being asked to wear a hijab in their free speech. I wonder what sort of things could be done to sort of support that cause. And sort of what's your stance on that as to what you think would be good to do in this case? I admire the courage of all the Iranian women who are standing up for their right to choice. and I stand with them, I support them, and they must know that they're not alone, that women around the world are joining them in this mission. It is every woman's right to decide what she wants to wear. It should not be a state or a group of people telling women how they should dress, what they should wear, what they should not wear, and what is right and what is wrong in terms of their dress code or other things in their life. Just as we never tell men what is sort of a more acceptable dress code. Like why impose that on women? It's really important that we realize that it is about human liberty and human freedom that they make those decisions for themselves. It's so important. And it's really time that Iran becomes the country, that the Iranian women wanted to be. So it's the right of the citizens to decide how their country should be treating them, what their country should be providing them. And that is something that we have literally just forgotten in the current day politics, where states are just behaving so differently. It should be the other way around. State should be serving the people. State should be providing the basic needs to people. And so I hope that it really challenges the way we see things right now and really reminds us to question. You know, it's not just limited to Iran. It's for, you know, countries in every corner of the world where states right now are denying women their rights. They are limiting their choices, and they are putting more pressure on their shoulders. They are limiting, you know, women's just basic human rights, whether that's in America or in France or in other part of the world. It's really important that women's dignity and freedom is recognized in every corner of the world. No country can ask a woman what to wear, whether that is to tell them to wear a hijab or whether that is to tell them that they cannot wear a hijab, right? It's about the right to choose. Yeah. Absolutely. It's good that you mentioned the not-wehah the hijab problem as well because that exists here in Europe, in France, where there is a ban, a Burka ban at the moment. So I think we're dealing with quite a range of different issues and all sort of aim towards, like, you know, what women can do and can't do. but just sort of moving on from the Iran issue and the situation that's going on there and to the future endeavors and to things that you are planning to do so firstly what is the most exciting thing that you're planning to implement or do in the near future going forward the most exciting thing yeah um that's a That's a difficult question, if I have to be honest. I'm really excited about the production company that I have started. It's called Extracurricular, and I currently partner with Apple TV Plus. I'm really excited to be producing shows which are centered around the stories of women. And I believe that we need to give the opportunity of storytelling to more people who can come forward and tell us how they see the world. And it's important for us to hear and see more perspectives and more point of views on our screens and ensure that we are exposed to a diverse range of views. And it really helps us to open our minds and to think more openly. So I'm really excited about that. And some projects are in progress as well. So we'll hopefully see things on screen. Well, we see you on screen in one of those. You can always see me on screen. You can just Google my name and just kidding. But I was going to actually ask about that because you called out Hollywood for the lack of Muslim representation. I presume that's something you'll aim to sort of implement in the new production company. But also what sort of production, like are you going to be, what's going to be your involvement in it. So hopefully I'll be producing all sorts of shows including like comedies, documentaries, movies and I'm a big fan of entertainment. I grew up watching Bollywood movies, Indian TV dramas, the Star Plus ones, and I watched Cartoon Network. I was a big fan of like Courage the Cowardly Dog and Tom and Jerry and all of that. So, you know, those things influence you in so many ways. It shows you a whole different world. And, you know, what you see on screen, you sometimes question it. You know, is it how the world should be? Is it how the world should not be? Should it be different? So I've learned so much from that. And, you know, when I was in university, I'm sure we all do that. Just before the deadline, I would just start binge watching a show. For me, it was the big bang. theory. I just got addicted to that. And to be honest, that's how I lived my university life. And we're watching friends and other TV shows. Same for most of us. Yeah, I think I'm not giving you the best advice. Focus on your studies, guys. Make sure you do your essays on time. Don't leave it to the last minute. So, you know, you mentioned the representation of Muslim artists and people from other background. It's really important and Riz Ahmed is doing an incredible work on that he started the Pillars artist fellowship so there are so many people who are already in the industry who are like you know they know that they are just a few from their community to get the opportunity to be there so they're not taking it for granted they are ensuring that they create space for others like them to get into the field and to tell their stories so I hope that more and more people from all backgrounds can get the opportunity to share their stories on screen. Yeah, no, sounds fantastic. And I have one last question before we move it to the floor. But I believe it was last year, about two years ago, I think about two years ago. You mentioned in a Vogue interview in a comment that I don't understand why people have to get married. And it was slightly taken out of context. There was some, like, you know, like some sort of backlash. But what was the context? of the whole situation. I actually wrote an article on that as well in Vogue. So yeah. So, no, I think when I was interviewed for the British Vogue, I was asked about marriage. And I said, like, I did not know what to say, actually. And it was such a heavy topic for me, partly because of what I had seen in my childhood growing up, seeing how so many girls were forced into marriages, why, you know, how it was not even a choice for many of those girls. It was a decision taken by the family, told to girls that they cannot attend their school anymore and they're getting married. But also at the same time, many of whom, you know, whatever age they got married at, they were told that now their choices were limited. They could not do a job, and they had to live a completely different life. So just because of all of those reasons, I had concerns, So when I was asked about marriage, I was like, I'm not sure, like, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, I'm questioning the institution. I'm questioning the, uh, the, uh, the patriarchy here. I'm questioning the, you know, the, the stereotypical role that's expected. Um, so, and then six months later, I got married, so. So, uh, my husband is here, Asar Malik, over there. And, and. Yeah, I think it must have been challenging for him, you know, seeing my interview. She doesn't want to get married, okay. No, I think for me it was, and I was really grateful that we had really meaningful conversations together to discuss what marriage means to both of us and how it's about friendship, it's about companionship, it's about supporting each other in the things that we want to do in our life, always standing by each other, and you know just ensuring that we are in agreement that we are not expecting anything stereotypical you know from each other and we realize that you know we have so much in common and we are in agreement so it's you know I think whatever we call it marriage partnership whatever I think it's about two people deciding to live together to support each other and to ensure to give the best time to each other So it's really important that we question the institutions, that we question the systems around us. You know, even if six months later we change our mind, that's okay. But it's important to question them. Yeah, no. Thank you very much for that. So, we'll now open the floor to questions. Well, I recognize that member at the back there, yes. Yes. Yes. First off, it's so wonderful to hear you speak. Malala, I last saw you when I was 13, and you came to surprise a bunch of Dubai residents. bunch of Dubai residents at a premiere for your movie. He named you Malala, so it's great to see you here now. My question also relates to your future endeavors. Many, many years ago before you joined university, you voiced dreams of becoming the next Pakistani Prime Minister. And I wondered if an entry into Pakistani politics is still on the table for you, and that's something that you're considering. Given in your interview with Vogue, last year, you mentioned feeling a little aimless about what to do next. So does Pakistani politics look like? like something you might do next. Thank you so much for the question. I would say right now my focus is Gull's education. And most of us, when we talk about politics and when we talk about becoming prime minister and president, it's always the urge to make change that drives us to that decision. When I was 11 years old, when I saw that extremism in Swat Valley, and when I realized that politicians were just so inactive, and they were so slow in reacting, I decided at age 11 that I want to become a prime minister. So my hope was that I could just go and fix the country, hopefully, but with time you realize that there are limitations. And in the end, if you want change, whatever profession, career, job you pick, you can make that change happen through that. And it's all about activism. So whatever your profession you take, you can still be an activist. And activism is the most important thing to me. I hope that I see that day in my lifetime where all girls can have access to quality education and where we say like zero girls are out of school. So that is something that I want to see in my lifetime. And regarding becoming prime minister, I don't know, what's the average age? So I'm sure I have a lot of time. Thank you very much. I recognize the member at the front there, yes. Just the middle, the black top. Well, either of them. I'm going to be very aggressive about this and take this away from you, even if I think it was originally me. Did you please speak louder? Yes. As a Cambridge student, I have to respectfully disagree that Oxford is the best institution in the world. But Malala, I am very glad to be here today to hear you speak, and I am so incredibly inspired. My question is twofold, but I'll just take one. How do you deal with the... deal with the pressure of being one amongst the disadvantaged or marginalized community that you represent with a platform? How do you deal with the discomfort, if there is any for you? How do you deal with, perhaps the injustice, because there are so many that are unheard? And is part of your new adventure into popularizing women's voices from diverse backgrounds related to that sentiment at all? Thank you so much. I think we can debate about which university is better later, but coming to your main question. For me, I realized the potential of the platform that I have from a very early age, and I realized that I had this opportunity to speak at a lot of these big platforms and stages many times. Now it's time that I bring the voices of other women and girls to the platform. So when I meet a president and prime minister of a country, I ensure that an activist from that country goes with me. And most of those activists are usually not given a chance to sit in that room and to ask questions from the leaders directly. I remember when I was in Nigeria and we were speaking with the vice president, the activists who went with me to the meeting later told me that, you know, this may never have happened. where they get the opportunity to ask directly from their leaders and then stay in touch with them to really hold them accountable. And when I speak at the UN and other platforms, I ensure that if I'm given 10 minutes to speak, I speak for two minutes and introduce other activists who can then speak and share their own story because I know that they can say it better than me. They can tell everyone in that room directly what is happening in their life rather than, me telling their story, well, you know, while they could be just there on the stage themselves. And it's important that we all recognize what we can do for others. Sometimes, you know, because we have been in a position where our voices have been silenced or denied, we, you know, once we get that opportunity, we have to reflect on that opportunity and ensure that we look around ourselves and make sure that if there are others who do not have a voice, who are not given a platform that we bring them forward. We give space to them as well. So this is like a huge and important part of my activism. When I talk about Afghan advocacy, Afghan activists are always there in those rooms, in those discussions, and they ask questions directly from leaders. We called a meeting of the feminist foreign policy countries, and Afghan activists all were there, girls, other activists, other activists as well. And they really challenge the leaders in that room about their commitment to a feminist foreign policy and how they were just acting like any other country. They were challenged to show what it means to have a feminist foreign policy in your country, and what more they can do for Afghan girls. And they spoke so powerfully in that room. So this is really crucial to me to do that. Thank you very much. I recognize that member back there. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. All right, I just, before my question, I just want to say Oxford is the best. So my name is Wont. It's a pleasure seeing you again, Malala. I've had a privilege being parable. with you at the UN and also with the playing international intensive work with girls and women as well. And one of those things that I do admire is the work you did with the award at school with Gordon Brown. And activities are really incredible field, really passionate for you, especially working for the specific course. In terms of the students here at Oxford, who are from diverse bygrounds. different professions, incredible leaders with amazing story. How can you integrate your work in terms of finding purpose, inspiring them to be able to follow parallel for global change or sustainability around our world? If you will say one word to a student or specific world of inspiration, what will you lead to the students here from Oxford and different universities? Thank you. Thank you. Do you want to, do you want to say, repeat the precise question part of that, please? So the question is basically like giving your experience in background. How can you write a students here from different background to find a common purpose for humanity? Could be through the sustainable development goals or through different fields as well. So in terms of like the work that I do, for me personally, it is supporting other activists who are doing the work on the ground. When we talk about girls' education, it is a global issue. And it's happening in different parts of the world where girls are denied the right to education. Or they're not given the quality education and the facilities that they need in order to stay in school. So most girls drop out of their schools at some stage in their life because of the lack of infrastructure and facilities or because of social norms as well. So the things that girls, the issues that girls face in Brazil are very different to the issues that girls face in Afghanistan and then the issues that girls face in Nigeria. So for us it was really important to ensure that we have a bottom-up approach where we work with the local activists who identify the problems and the barriers that girls are facing. and ensure that they have solutions addressing those problems. And local activists already have NGOs. They're already doing the work on the ground, and they need more support and resources to make their work available on a bigger scale to reach to more girls, to make it more effective as well. And that's the model that we have at the fund. So we currently work in nine countries. We are reaching up to 100 activists right now. We are supporting activists in Pakistan, in Brazil, in Afghanistan, in India, in Nigeria, in Ethiopia, and in so many other countries where they are doing advocacy to change policies, including passing a legislation in the state of Kaduna in Nigeria to get rid of the hidden school fees and make education completely free for students by law. And they are also providing alternative means of learning as well, including the work that Harun Yassin is doing through Talimabad in Pakistan, where they are providing educational content on, you know, through technology, through television and other means as well. And these activists are also doing research work by which they are showing us the stats and figures and they are making recommendations to the policymakers on what they need to do for girls' education to make it a quality education for all girls. So, and a lot of these activists are engaging with the local communities as well, really convincing parents and local community leaders to understand education in the local context. I think I'm getting like cough or something when I go from here. Okay. So this is the way that we do our work. It's more sort of locally led, but also we do advocacy on the global level as well, using the global platforms, you know, the opportunities that are there at the G7, G20, the Global Partnership for Education, the UN, and other platforms as well, to really have a really holistic approach in making a change happen. You know, if you want to see change around the world for every girl, then this is a huge task and you have to work in all directions from all sides as well. Yeah. Thank you very much. Anyone upstairs that wants to ask a question? Yes, I recognize that member there. Sort of by nature of your incredible story and work, you've become an inspiration to millions of people around the world. Who would you say inspired you when you were sort of coming into being such an important global figure? Are there any people that you really looked up to and sort of try to model yourself on? Thank you so much for the question. I was 10 years old when I first appeared in front of a camera and when I first shared my story. At that time, the person who inspired me was my father, Ziauddin Yusuf Zai. He was the person who I was the closest to, who I could see in my home doing activism for women's rights, for peace in Swat Valley. And he was a dedicated person for, you know, for as long as I can remember him, he was always in action doing something. And he's a person who doesn't just talk about things. He believes that, you know, that there's no time to talk about it. You have to do something about it. When I was born, it was, you know, a good news for him, but for many family members, the news was that, oh, it's, you know, it's a girl again, it's not a boy. And my father was really proud that he had. had a daughter and he, even when he was deciding to name me, he decided to name me after Malala Yafmei Van, which is this Afghan heroine, because he believed that we need to have more women known by their own name. Because in our culture, sadly, we do not have that many women in our history who are known by their own names and women are usually not even referred to by their own name. So he wanted to challenge that. So I was inspired by him because of the way he was treating his sisters and my mom. And he was like, he was sort of different than others. And when, you know, you can be preached about all of these things. You can be told, you know, this is right, this is wrong. But what really influences you and impacts you is action that you see around you, by your family members, by your colleagues, by your friends. And that says a lot. and he inspired me through his actions. But other than that, I have met so many incredible people around the world, especially right now when I do my advocacy, I go to different countries, including Iraq, Nigeria, Kenya, Brazil. I meet these incredible young activists who are not afraid, who are not giving up, who understand the urgency, and they are taking action. and they're speaking out for climate justice, they're speaking out for reproductive health and rights. They are also challenging people who are oppressive and who are denying women their rights. They're talking about mental health and other issues. And I'm really proud of the activism that young people are doing right now, including Vanessa Nakate and Greta Thumburg and many other incredible girls who are just reminding us that, that we should not just tell ourselves as if the world is the perfect place right now. There are so many things that are happening right now that will impact us and our future generations if we do not take action right now, whether that is climate justice or wars and conflicts or the protection of human rights. Thank you very much. We'll take last two more questions. We'll have a question from the member here. You sort of touched on this on your last response, and earlier you mentioned the impact of climate disasters on women's education. In what ways do you think that climate change will shape your activism in the future and the women's rights movement more generally? So just recently we did a study at Malala Fund, which shows that up to 12.5 million girls are at risk of dropping out of school because of climate related events in 2025. So when we talk about climate disasters like floods and droughts, we should not just talk about them in isolation. They are directly impacting women and girls. And they are impacting girls' education as well. It's important that we remind ourselves that all of these other issues that we talk about, poverty, gender discrimination, social norms, and climate change. And all of these issues directly impact gulls and why they drop out and why they're not receiving quality education in their schools. So it's really important in the work that we do. We all have heard about the recent floods in Pakistan. I was able to visit Karachi just a week or two ago and visit one of the refugee camps. And it was – I visited this informal settlement where women and gulies – were just completely hopeless. They were asking for basic needs. And I met a girl. She was in grade 10. She was worried about her education because in this place, they did not even have a school for children. And children were just limited to basic things like just drawing and primary level literacy. Girls were not able to have their secondary education. And she has a dream to become a doctor and do something for her family, but it is not possible for her because there's no focus given to education, unfortunately, when it comes to providing aid. You know, oftentimes it's about the urgent needs, and education is not treated as, you know, as part of the emergency aid. It's really important that we challenge that. The longer a child, especially a girl, stays out of school, the harder it is for her to go back. So it's important that we think about long-term solutions. as well. And in the long term, we have to invest in the safe and quality education of children to ensure that we create climate resilient economies going forward. So Gull's education and education and quality education for all children acts as one of the most sustainable effective solutions for climate change and other issues as well. Absolutely. And just the last final question. I choose that, can I recognize that member at the back. Well, whilst we wait for the question, your good friends with Greta Thunberg, I believe. We've heard a lot of rumors about Greta coming to Oxford. Is she actually coming to Oxford, or is that? You know, I even asked her this time. I saw Greta just two days ago, and I told her, I said, I strongly recommend you apply to Oxford. I am the best ambassador of Oxford University, doing it all for free. Yeah, if she applies, you know, I'll take all the credit. Hi, thank you. My name is Koshika. Thank you so much for being here. It's been amazing listening to you. My question to you is kind of stemming from what you were speaking about you and, you know, some of the issues within that. When we talk about the violence, crimes against humanities in Afghanistan, and one of the other actors and violence perpetuated by them that we don't talk about. And I would love to know your views on is the US forces, right? And almost the attempt by the United States of America to immobilize the International Criminal Court recently and to prevent the investigation from going ahead, which also hampers girls' education along with other basic human rights for Afghani citizens. And I would love to know your views on that and how do you think we can address political cloud created by, you know, big nations like this? and the violence and prevent impunity in the crimes that they have committed. Thank you. Thank you so much. You know, it's important to hold everyone accountable, and it's important that we do our advocacy and our activism on every level. Each state has a responsibility to defend and protect human rights. and whether that's the United States or the UK or Pakistan or Saudi Arabia or any other country it's really but I will say that sometimes in the world of activism it's all focused on like Western countries or you know it's to be honest like it is it's really hard to control narrative it's really hard to control the messaging and especially in the world of social media before you know it, you know, a perspective is already spreading, a narrative is already spreading. So it's important for us, especially in the world of social media, that we take a pause and really think about things more holistically and have a bigger picture of what's happening and realize that we all can play a different role in the activism. We all have different opportunities, different platforms that we can use. We can support other activists. We can become the voice of an issue that we strongly feel about. We can, you know, we can do our own bit. We can question those, you know, in our own constituencies and we can, like, mobilize groups and we can do protests on the streets as well. So it's really understanding, like, what role you can play. And I would say that, you know, let's support, like, let's appreciate everyone who's, who's doing. their bit. I usually don't say like, you know, if someone is doing enough or not or someone is doing it the right way or the wrong way, I think we all should try to do the best that's in our capacity. But just in terms of like the vision that I see for the world, I hope that we ourselves become more active in creating a world that is more equal, fairer. for everyone that we see a world where education is the right of every child and it's given to them where no girl is denied the right to school and where we ensure that every child has access to safe education. Ameth, you know, we are here sitting on the stage together but we have so much in common in our stories, you know, what happened in December 2014 where a school was attacked and more than 130 children were killed, many injured, many just went through an unimaginable trauma of what they saw on that day. And we have so many stories of children facing violence and extremism in their schools, in their, you know, in their neighborhoods. And that needs to change. Education is the basic human right of every child. And it's, you know, let's make it happen. and let's make it possible that we see a world where every child can go to school safely without any fear and they receive the quality education that they deserve. And I hope that we see that in our lifetime. Thank you very much. Just before we leave, I just wanted to say, and I was going to say this before the event as well, that it is an absolute honor for all of us that you are here today. You have inspired millions of people. The sincerity that you speak with is inspiring. We all, as the chamber, and I as the President, wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. We'll hopefully see you soon in the Union as well. Thank you very much. Thank you.
