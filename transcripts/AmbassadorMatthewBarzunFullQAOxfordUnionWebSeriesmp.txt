 Good evening everyone and thank you so much for joining us at tonight's union event. Today we are honoured to be joined by Ambassador Matthew Balson, who is an American diplomat. Matthew has served as both the US ambassador to the United Kingdom and also to Sweden. He's also been National Finance Chair for Barack Obama, where he helped to pioneer new ways for people to have a stronger voice within politics. During his career, he's helped to fund networks in the early 90s, and Matthew is also the author of the book, The Power of Giving Away Power. During this talk, we are more than happy to receive questions from the audience, and you can do so by using the Q&A function in the chat. I'll now hand over to Matthew to say a couple of words about himself. Sure. Well, thank you for that introduction. I the beginning of it before I get kicked off. And congratulations, Rachel, for your leadership position here. And I wish I could be there with you all in person. Instead, I am joining you by accident from the Muhammad Ali International Airport, which is my adopted home city of Louisville, Kentucky. And we have lots of crazy weather. So here I am, stranded at the airport. Can you hear me okay, Rachel? Yes, all good on my end. Okay, great. So I was thinking about being with all of you, and it was almost exactly five years ago that I came back after having served as ambassador in your country for my country. And then it's been exactly two years since I last visited London. And I used to come back seven or eight times a year because I co-founded this company based in London called Tortoise Media, which I encourage people to check out. It was, I did it along with Katie Vanek-Smith, who's this amazing woman who was the president of the Wall Street Journal. And a wonderful journalist named James Harding, who was the head of the BBC, head journalist of the BBC and editor of the Times of London before that. And the three of us teamed up with other journalists and created tortoise media. So that would bring you back to London. But then, of course, in January 2020, the world began to shut down. And I got back from London and haven't been back since. So I miss it. and I miss all of you and watching Ted Lasso, although wonderful, doesn't cut it. It's not enough. So I look forward to being able to have a lively discussion with you all tonight. Definitely. Thanks so much again for joining us, Matthew. And I know you've mentioned your career as an ambassador to the UK in Sweden, but I know there's a lot of other things you've done throughout your career that we'd love to hear some more about. So I think if we start with your involvement with the Obama campaign, which is one of the things you've worked on, I just wanted to kind of ask you, I guess, what kind of led you to, you know, getting involved in that campaign and that position. Well, I got a, I got involved in politics the campaign before Senator at the time Obama ran. So this is back, you all are so young, but this is back 2003, so almost 20 years ago, which is crazy. John Kerry was running for president against George Debbie Bush. And I got involved with that campaign, and John Kerry did not win. He lost, but I learned a lot. And I think we tends to in life talk about the happy parts and the times where we win, but so often you lose a lot or learn a lot from those times where it doesn't work out. But anyway, and then I'm sitting at home one day. day in Kentucky and I get a call and my wife calls up from downstairs. She's like, you're going to want to take this one. And I was like, okay. And it was Senator Barack Obama and he hadn't announced he was running for president yet, but he was rumored. I mean, you know, people were hoping that he might be, including me. And he was at charge of raising money for the U.S. Senate. And he said, I want to come through Kentucky. Would you be willing to do an event for me? And I said, sure. I mean, because it's you. I think it'd be fun if you came to Kentucky. And I said, I'll do a fundraiser for you. If you would please do something that doesn't involve money, would you just be willing to come and talk to the people of Kentucky who don't can't afford to or don't want to give money to a political party, but I think would really benefit from hearing what you have to say. And you benefit from hearing that. And he said, sure, fine. So fast forward, he ends up coming. And we put the word out. And we didn't know if, I mean, you know that is that you don't know if like, A handful of people will come, hundreds of people. We had 5,000 people come and fill our minor league baseball park filled with people who wanted to hear Barack Hussein Obama, a junior center from Illinois speak. And he gave a beautiful speech that night. And then they spent the night. We did our fundraiser thing. He spent the night. And then the next morning, I got to take him. It was really neat. I got to take him to go meet Muhammad Ali. He had never met Muhammad Ali. And he really wanted to. Muhammad Ali had never met him and really wanted to. And I got to drive and the two men met at the Muhammad Ali Center. And I have a picture of that in my office back on. Wow, that's definitely interesting and the fact that I didn't know. But I just guess, I guess how was the experience like for you meeting Barack Obama? I know a lot of us look up to him, including myself as a role model. How was it like for you meeting him before he started his journey as president? And, you know, there was a moment, actually, after the night of great events, and before he met Muhammad Ali, there was a, Muhammad Ali pushed the meeting back because of some reason. I didn't know why. But we had an extra hour. And so I said to Senator Obama, I said, Senator, you can just take your black, you can go answer email. And he was busy man. And I said, you can just go, you have an extra hour. He said, no, no, I can do email later. Do you have any people who didn't come to the fundraiser last night, Republicans or independents or people who don't like politics? I was like, sure, you know. So I quickly called around and we got about maybe 12 people to come and sit around a table. And he went around and he started to his left, sort of went clockwise. And he asked everyone about their hopes and fears for the United States. And at the end, he played back what he had heard and he shared his own hopes and fears. to the United States. And then at the end, two things struck me, Rachel. One was this one woman who was at the table, he had laughed and she's like, oh my gosh, he's an amazing speaker. And I thought, I mean, he is. I'd heard him the night before. He gave him a great speech. He barely said a word in this hour. He just really, really listened. And people felt that that had been a discussion because they heard themselves speak and they heard him play back to them what they had said. And I learned more on this later, but a very important pattern that he put into practice. And then the second thing I learned from him was someone who couldn't attend that event called me after I dropped him off at the airport, dropped Obama off at the airport. And he said, wow, what was he like? Did he light up the room? And we use that expression often about celebrities or something. And I said, yeah, look, I said the room got lit up, but I don't think it's what you mean. It's not like it got lit up because he's like a son and we all just sort of reflect his light back. You know, we know leaders like that. He's not like that at all. I was like, the room got lit up because he got each person around that table to sort of switch on their own light bulb, as it were. And because of his commitment to asking interesting questions and really listening and then linking it to his own. And I tried to take that forward into diplomacy. and that is a theme that I pick up on in the book. Yeah, I think you definitely have kind of taken that grassroots approach into diplomacy but also into the campaign. I know citizens' fundraisers was kind of like an idea that you kind of helped introduce into the campaign. So what kind of led you to have that approach and led you to come up with this idea? Well, so it all gets back to that faithful night, before he ran for president. And we're sitting there with 5,000 people from every zip code, every postcode, you know, in your lingo. And Louisville is still in many ways too segregated a city. And then this night, it just was everyone, young, old, white, brown, black. It just was this kind of all of Louisville got up in this interesting way. And I did the event with these two amazing women, one named Carolyn, one name Brooke. And we were talking to ourselves just so excited that this was happening and it all came together. And we said, well, how many of these people, if he does run for president, would invest in the campaign? You know, I wondered. I don't know. And so when he announced he was running, he called me back up and said, I want to come back to Louisville. And I was like, absolutely. And so we organized these two events, you know, one, a traditional sort of fancy rubber chicken dinner, $1,000 a plate, fancy fundraiser. and then we did one for $20. And we kept, we asked 30 people under the age of 30 if they could try to sell 30 tickets to come see Obama. And they all, like, I don't know. And then they all did. And they said, can we do more? And we said, keep doing more. And so we had 500. And then 800 just kept growing and growing. And finally we had to just cut off the number because we kept on the end to change buildings. And then I get a call from the campaign headquarters saying, good news and bad names. Good news is he's coming, like he said he would. to Louisville, the bad news is he can only do one event and he's only going to do the fancy home. And I was so disappointed. And so I was moping around and my lovely wife, who's named as Brooke, said, you need to get on an airplane, go to Chicago, talk to the campaign manager. If that's the kind of campaign this is where they only want to do fundraisers for affluent people and not big ones for everybody, you shouldn't be involved. That doesn't sound like Obama. And I don't like to be one of those pushy people that shows up at campaign headquarters. But I did. And I met the campaign manager, who's amazing. And I made my case. And he said, I hear you, but no. And then I was tearing at my shoes. And he said, wow, you look depressed or something. And I said, I am depressed. And I'm also just trying to figure out how I'm going to give all the money back and all the tickets. He goes, what do you need? I said, we've sold 3,200 tickets. He said, you're kidding. I just thought you wanted permission to maybe do that. You've already done it? I was like, yeah, we already did it. He's like, go for it. So we did, and then we ended up doing that all around the company. Yeah, I think that's such an amazing story about, you know, the dedication it takes to make these events happen. Do you think these kind of grassroots events that Obama engaged in, do you think this changed the way people perceived his campaign? I do. And I'm going to be one of the things, I know what we meet. We use this phrase grassroots a lot, but I just want to gently push back. Like I don't like the term. And the reason I don't is, okay, so if everyone on this call or listening to it afterwards knows, if I say top down, we all know, and I'm sorry for the background noise here, if I say top down, everyone here could know what that feels like, right, being bossed around by bully bosses or whatever it might be. Nobody likes being on the receiving end of top down. So what we do is we often think, let's do the opposite of that. And you see this in companies, and you're sure you see that universities, they say, let's be bottom up. But here's the thing. I don't think bottom up is any better. And bottom up is the same shape. If you were asked to be part of a bottom's up exercise, you are forced under one or two positions. Either you look at your colleagues or fellow students as beneath you, who you look at yourself as beneath them. It is still a hierarchy. It's just in the reverse order. And I think grassroots has some of that same challenge. It sort of doesn't mean to be, but it's condescending. It's as if, oh, well, there's important stuff in the ivory tower, but we don't forget about those of you down below. And I just think that's an unhealthy and untruthful way of looking at our brothers and sisters and how we're actually organized. And the magic of Senator and President Obama was he didn't think of it like that. He didn't think he was at the top and other people were at the bottom. He maybe thought of himself as sort of in the middle as an organizer trying to engage with and link up with, you know, equals who were doing interesting things, maybe not running for office, but doing interesting things in their lives. And that's the pattern he set. And I think he did it in a way, and he's not the only one. I mean, lots of other leaders have done this. And I just don't think we appreciate or celebrate or pay attention to what they're doing and the habits and the practice, because we can all do this. And it all, interestingly, begins with giving away power. Yeah, definitely. I think just on the Obama campaign, I know obviously it was a long process from that initial meeting you had with him until, you know, where he is today. what would you say was your proudest moment throughout the whole campaign? Before it even started, I think it would be that moment that I just said, that that story of going to Chicago and pleading the case, not letting them cancel, what I knew they shouldn't want to cancel, if they could see the energy that I saw with those 3,200 people. But then another moment that sticks out is like right at the end. In fact, it's over. there's a there's a famous term in sorry this is so loud above me here there's a famous term in politics in my country and it's called the flake rate and it refers to if you have 10 volunteers how many will flake out and not show up right so that's the And every jaded political operative knows it. And if you've got a really, people are either depressed because they think their candidate's going to lose or they're cocky and too confident, you'll get a very high flake rate. It could be as high as 80%. So 10 people say they'll come, eight flake out only to come, right? That's the math. But on average, you sort of plan for 50%. You plan for half the people not to show up. So on election day, because of this pattern of inclusion that was set early on in the campaign and repeated all around the country in one of the main swing states of Virginia, which was a very important state back then, guess what I talked to one of the field organizers. And she told me what the flake rate was for volunteers on election day. And she said, I don't even, she said it was negative 50%. I was like, what do you mean? And she goes, I know we don't even have a name for it. For every 10 people who said they would show up, 15 people showed up. They did the opposite of flake out. They got other people to join in and not flake out. And that to me, the mathematics of what can happen if you practice from the very beginning, even in small, almost unnoticeable ways, like he did sitting around that table with 12 people, listening to them, you keep that up over and over again, and then you get multiplication of a negative footprint. And that always really happens me. Yeah, I think that's definitely interesting, the fact that, you know, Obama was so able to efficiently, you know, engage the communities in that way. I think, obviously, you've told us a bit about your proudest moments, but looking back at the campaign, at the whole period, do you have anything that you maybe regret or anything you would change, if you could do it again, I guess? totally. And the big ones, all those stories, and I hear my tone of voice changed when I tell stories about that first campaign. That's 2007, 2008. I'm a volunteer from Kentucky, not a very traditional. I'm trying to think of what it would be like in British terms, but you know, like Kentucky is a very red, you know, Republican. It's not a place that typically, it hasn't voted for a Democratic president in a long time. And it didn't grow up on then. But it was, It was just amazing to be part of. And I compared it to sort of like surfing a wave or something like that. It was just amazing, exhilarating. Then four years later, I was actually finance chair. So I came back from Sweden early to take this leadership role on the new campaign. The new campaign, the re-election campaign, was nothing like surfing. It was like swimming out in cold water against the crashing surf. It wasn't much fun at all. I love the people I worked with. I'm so glad I did it. I'm so glad he won. But it had a very different pattern. And I'll summarize it very quickly. In the first campaign, and by the way, Senator Obama didn't think this up and nor did his senior team. But in Iowa, the team there wrote up, I think they did this, did it in like handwritten on butcher paper. Respect, empower, include. Respect and power include. and they wrote that on every sign, and soon enough that was on every single campaign office all around the country. And it was a good description of what the campaign was doing at all times, respecting and power including. In the re-election campaign, when you walked into our headquarters in Chicago, we had a fancy one now, printed out, not in handwritten, but like big letters, and that said respect, empower, include, but we added a word, win. And it was supposed to be kind of tough. Like, sure, respect, and power include, yeah, that's fine, in service of winning. We never would have said that four years before. And that second campaign was kind of sharper. It was just about winning, do the bare minimum we need to do to win, and then that's it. And that's not nearly as energy producing. I can't come up with any fun stories. I'm a plenty of stories, but they don't inspire me from that campaign. Because we lost that magic. And that's why I ended up writing this book, because this magic you can create when you make something with other people isn't inevitable. And it often calcifies and turns into something very different from magic. and you end up if you're not careful in, and you can see institutions do this. Countries do it, diplomats do it, and I call it reverse alchemy, where we take the gold of good intention and people wanting to engage and we turn it into lead because of how we treat people. And good people do this, you know? Yeah, I was just going to say you mentioned the magic and I guess losing that in a way. Looking at, you know, politicians in the UK, around the world in today's society, do you think there is kind of that, you know, just winning mentality where they kind of focused on winning, but forget, I guess, the roots of what made them want to go into politics and what made them want to start the campaign in the first place? Yeah. Yes, and I just, I went and checked the chat, and I saw a chat of question about, and it ties to how I would answer your question. And the chat question, I think, was about advice to the 21-year-old self. If we were all together at the student union and we were all there, I would ask everyone, hey, quick show of hands, how many people here like to lose an argument? And most people, if they're honest, like no one will raise their hand. Right. And it's actually why when I was in the UK, both at Oxford and a Cambridge, when I was invited to do sort of debate style things, I would say, and I used to be on the high school debate team, and I was quite good at it. And I was like, I'm never, and I wrote my entrance examination to university in America about how I never wanted debate ever again. And I've stayed true to that. I won't debate. So I love what we're doing here, which is having a conversation. And so my advice, my 21-year-old self, is that there is a, obviously in our culture, there is a role for winning and losing. But sort of like the story I took, when you add the word win next to respect and power include, you kind of ruin the power of respecting and empower and including because you think winning triumphs. It cheapens those other words. And I did this test when I came back from London, I would just, everyone I'd meet pre-COVID, right? So you could actually meet people. And let's say there were 10 people gathered. I would ask them, I'd say, hey, what's the opposite of winning? And everyone would say losing. And I'd say, yeah, yeah, I agree. But then I was like, I have a more interesting question, I think. What's the opposite of winning and losing? And then there'd be like this awkward pause. And my unscientific approach here, nine out of ten of us answer the following. I don't know, not playing. One in ten of us, and the answer is always slightly different, but one in ten of us basically says playing or being or loving or laughing or learning or all the other things we do in life that aren't about winning and losing. And it's so weird that nine out of ten of us think if you're not winning and losing, you are doing nothing. And that is really strange. And my 21-year-old itself definitely would have said doing nothing if you're not winning and losing it. And then you realize, like, I'm a parent, in a marriage, in your career. You cannot win your career. I'm not saying you can't have achievements and setbacks along the way. Of course you can. But you can't win it. You can't win parenting. You can't win being a partner or a spouse. Although you could certainly lose that if you try to win it. And yet we think that's everything to offer. And we put that at the front of our lives. And I think there are costs and consequences of the habits of winning and losing that crowd out these other habits that we know deep down are much more fulfilling. Yeah, I know you yourself, after kind of working with Barack Obama on his campaign and helping with the fundraising with that, you've kind of moved into diplomacy following that. So I just wanted to ask what kind of motivated the shift for you personally and led you to kind of leave that part behind and move into this new stage in your career? I didn't honestly, I didn't want to do it exactly. And when someone first approached me, so he won back when I told you know, he won. and that was so exciting. And then they said, hey, would you like to get involved in the administration? And I said, sure. And I used to love the show West Wing. And so I was like, okay, yeah, sure, I'll come to Washington. I'll do something like that. And they said, no, we think you'd be a good ambassador. And I at the time was 35 years old or something, which I mean, that's actually sort of old, but relative to where I am seems kind of young. And I remember thinking, I don't know, diplomat, it's like old people, you know, like really old people, like retired people who want to just like go to cocktail party. But I was pretty ignorant. I mean, I just didn't know what the job was. And then I met, there's a wonderful friend of a friend who had worked for Colin Powell, who was a Republican and Walter Pansteiner. And he gave me all this great advice. He just told me what the job was. And I was like, oh, okay, that sounds amazing. And so ended up going to serve. in Sweden. But at this moment, another highlight of a lesson I learned from President Obama. So at this point, I can't tell any of my friends that I'm going to Sweden, but I know that he's nominating me. And he invites me to come see him in the West Wing. And so it's the first time I'd seen him since he had been elected president. And so I went in to the Oval Office, which is kind of neat. It looks just like it does on TV. We chit chat for a little bit. And then they sit down. And it looks, again, just like the TV show. So he's sitting in the chair next to the fireplace, and I'm sitting all the way over on the sofa. And I really only had one question to ask him. So I just said it. And I said, Mr. President, what advice would you have for a first-time diplomat? I remember he sort of looked up at the chandelier for kind of longer than I would have thought. And then he said, well, Matthew, listen. And I said, and I had a pen and a little black notebook, and I had it all written out. And I was ready to write down all his pearls of wisdom. But that's all he said. And it took me a moment. And there was this really awkward pause. And he wasn't saying, Matthew, listen to all my great advice. His advice was just listen. listen. And now, again, I had seen him listen to those fellow Kentuckyans that morning, you know, a year and a half before. And so I really took that into diplomacy. And I was like, that is the same job. You know, the fundraising job I had for him as a volunteer is diplomacy. I mean, the subject matter is slightly different, but the act of like doing it, which is why when I arrived, fast forwarding to showing up in the UK, the big research company Pew had just put out a big release, 40 countries asking people under the age of 25 in 40 different countries, do you really like the United States? Not so much or don't like it. In 39 of the 40 countries, young people under 25 had a higher opinion of America than their parents and grandparents except for one country. You guys. So the United Kingdom, young people in the United Kingdom, had a lower opinion of America. And I thought, well, okay, there's an opportunity. I know what we shouldn't do, which is like, I'm not going to go engage with young people and give some speech about American foreign policy because I used to be young once, and I wouldn't have wanted that, and I didn't want to do that. So we ended up doing this workshop, and I went to 200 different six-form colleges, and all around England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales. In fact, I wouldn't go anywhere and not do one. So we did 200, 6th Farm Colleges, 100 kids at a time. So 20,000 students by the end. Exact same workshop every single time. And it was based on what I learned from Obama, asking them about their hopes and fears, listening to it, talking about them, and just repeating that over and over again. And I remember some people on the team on my team being like, is that the promise? Like, I don't know, I thought you were supposed to be at number 10 downing and at the foreign office. So we did all of that too, of course. But I just think we tend to undervalue. Basically, I think listening is policy. That's what I've come to do. Yeah, I think your message of listening that you've kind of heard, you've kind of shown that, especially whilst as ambassador to Sweden, you really prioritised outreach and engagement. So I just want to ask on this, do you think that like this outreach and engagement strategy was lacking before and this was something you kind of brought in? Or do you think there were like the building blocks in place and you were developing the strategies? You know how we talked about the word grassroots? There's another word that I used a lot. We all use. But I think it's one of these ones that we should come up with a better one. So I think the, and the word is outreach. And I think embassies, American, British, are generally pretty good at outreach. But outreach, picture it here, imagine being on the receiving end of someone reaching out. Like, it's kind of a weird, what do you doing? Like, what do you want? It's kind of creepy at its worst. And I think institutions are pretty bad at it because they think it's like, well, we have, stuff and we will reach out to other people and basically tell them what we're up to. And that pattern is sort of the opposite of what, you know, Senator Obama was doing back around that table, the opposite of what I was trying to do in those six phone classes of like, and even the word listening has sort of been cheapened by politicians on your side of the Atlantic and mine who go on listening doors, but you know they have their mind made up anyway. They're just going to try to go to every constituency and sort of pretend to listen. Or it's this great thing that a friend of mine once said, he was hired by a CEO of a big corporation. And he said, I want my people to feel heard. And my friend said to him, okay, I won't help you do that. I will help you hear people, but I'm not gonna help you make people feel heard. Because that's just like faking and pretending. Like really listen. And you're only going to really listen if you really want to, and if you're really open to change and having your mind change or else you're just fake. And that really stuck with me too. So, but anyway, so I think embassies have always been pretty good about outreach. And I think sometimes it was too much sort of, um, yeah, or like you'd show up at school. So that's not me, but you'd show up and you'd give a lecture and then leave. And I did plenty of that too about, way. Yeah, I know you've mentioned, you know, going into schools, which was obviously something that was important to you. But is there any other part of your wife as an ambassador that was particularly rewarding to you and you particularly enjoyed? I remember I was sitting in London at some, I forget what it was, sort of unimportant, but it was some big British American business kind of Chamber of Commerce type tuxedo thing. And I had to go give a speech and someone else gave a speech. I forget what I said. I thought I did a pretty good job, but the guy sitting who I was sitting next to you just clearly, really didn't like my speech at all. And he'd had a couple glasses of wine, so he felt kind of comfortable enough. And I guess I was encouraging him to share why he found it so unsatisfying. And he did. And then he said, do you want to actually be helpful? And I was like, sure. That's my job. This was early on in my London. he said, okay, I go to your country, so pointing his finger. I go to your country seven times a year for business. And you treat me, your people, treat me like they've never seen me before. And last time I had to wait three hours in line at JFK airport just to get through. He's like, if you did something about that, that could actually be helpful in contrast to whatever policies you were talking about in your speech. So I end up looking into it. I don't want to board the team with the whole. I looked into it. And there was a wonderful person on my team who knew all about this. And he's like, well, we used to let British citizens do this special thing that Americans could do called global entry. And I said, well, we tested it with them first. Of any country in the world, we tested it with the Brits. And we had 500 slots and they filled up in an afternoon. And that was eight years ago and we've never done anything since. I was like, well, can we open it up? Uncapped. And he's like, it'll take a bunch of work. And we spent two years week. I mean, a bunch of people spent a lot of hard work and time. And then I was able to during my time, let any British citizen apply for global entry and save them. It went from three hours to like 45 seconds if it all goes smoothly. I mean, COVID and all this other stuff is complicated all of that. But what I learned from that man was like rather than just be defensive, which I was originally. I was like, okay, I'm sure he has something. I can learn something from how much I disappointed this person. And then it led to this discovery of something really practical and practical that could treat people with respect and make them feel included when they came to visit our country. So that was a very tangible one. Yeah, I mean, I know one of the main roles that you were able to achieve as ambassador was, I guess, building connections between the two countries. And I think what you've explained just now just shows how you really help. to solidify these connections by removing all of the obstacles that existed there. So I think that's great. And I know another really great thing you've done during your time as ambassador was that you set up the UK Young Leaders Program while you were in office. So this was obviously enabling you to kind of speak to young people in the UK. Would you be able to, for the members who are watching, explain a bit more about the program and what led you to set it up? Sure, yeah, I missed the, and I keep in touch. I just was chatting the other day online with the former member of Young Leaders UK, which we then called Y-L-L-U-K. It was shamelessly borrowed the idea from President Obama had started the Young African Leadership Initiative, Yali, probably had a catchier name, Yali. But a friend. of mine, worked in Washington, D.C. for President Obama, and he took a big job at the State Department that sort of the week or two when they were just announcing who would be members of young African leaders initiative. Well, I'll come back to Wylock in a moment, but this story I think is important. So my friend is there. And unlike Wyloff, which we'll talk about in the moment, which we had no money I'll talk about. President Obama had actually taken money away from countries like from embassies like mine, like ours in London, and from other parts in Europe to fund, which made sense to me. You know, it wasn't fun to lose the funding, but he had a plan and wanted to focus it on young African leaders. So he did. And they would fly to America for three weeks. It was a very expensive program, very hands-on and immersive. And so my friend is in the meeting, and they've just picked the 500 people who are selective. And my friend asks the person who's been working on the program, how many people apply? You know what I mean? We picked 500 out of what number. And the guy said, well, 50,000 apply. And my friend's like, wow. He said, okay, what are we doing with the 49,500 people who didn't, weren't selected yesterday? This is what's interesting. And the person, and this is a good person who says to my friend, I mean, a good, hardworking, responsible, thoughtful diplomat, says to my friend, what do you mean? The losers? Now, this we talked earlier about winning and losing and the weird things it does to us when you just look at the world that way. It led this wonderful diplomat to think of 49,500 people as losers. And my friend who was brand new to the State Department, like practically grips out his hair and says, they are not losers. They are double handraisers, young women and men from all over that time who have written an application. They have put so much energy, time, money into this process. How dare we think of them as losers? and how dare we do nothing just because they didn't come to America for three weeks. So then he's like, we're going to launch a virtual, we're going to do something. And then the person says, but we have no money. He's like, I don't like we don't have money. We have time. We have energy. We have initiative. We're going to do something. And he ends up creating a, it's like an online sort of seminar kind of thing for the 49,500. And I tell this sort of long story just because we're all now and in your next chapter, you will work in these organizations and we end up building obstacles for ourselves, right? Like, yeah, but they're losers. And they're like, yeah, well, they didn't give us permission to do this. He said, well, go ask them. So they asked the 49,500. How many, guess how many wanted to participate? Forty-nine thousand two hundred and fifty, I mean, everybody wanted to do it. And by the time he left that job, I think it was up to 180,000 participants. Right? How cool. So I hear this story. And I was like, okay, we've got to do this. So I was like, I'm meeting with 20,000 high school kids. But we have a weird rule in our embassy. If you're under the age of 18 or 19, we can't. Like there's just a, so we couldn't do a program for a school age kid, you know, people that age. So I was like, well, okay. But if you're over 18 or you're in your 20s, we ought to do something. And normally what we do is we let you apply and we pick one person out of 100 and we send them to. America. I'm just interested in the bigger group of people who raised their hands. And so we started this program called Wildlife. And I said, the only thing I care about is that we don't start it in London. And I was like, I'm going to randomly ask four people I meet in Plymouth. The Plymouth is very important to America because that's where the Mayflower set sail. It's a complicated part of our history and it's sort of interesting. So I was like, we're in Plymouth. We're going to ask four people in Plymouth of that age group if they would join and we asked them only three questions. Share with me a frustration about America, a hope about America, and one image that what America means to you on their iPhone, whatever. And we'd submit it, we did it. And then it grew to, I think, 2,800 by the time I left. And we just grew at that. We started with four people in Plymouth and we said spread the word. And when we went places, we went. And it grew that way. And then if we had an interesting speaker live. We had the Reverend Jesse Jackson came and then we would invite, we couldn't invite everybody, but we'd have 30 people come and do a roundtable with him. And it just became a wonderful vibrant group who brought a lot of energy to it. We didn't have a lot of money or anything else, but we did have time, energy. And I'm very, very proud of the work we did pulling up together. I think it's definitely very interesting that you talk about, you know, wanting to get every single young person involved, not just picking the winners and the losers, so to say, but making sure that everyone has a chance to be involved. I was just wondering, what advice would you give to, I guess, a young person to encourage them to put their hand up, so to say, if they're interested in getting involved in politics, activism, or anything in society? It's, there was a moment at the end of my time in London was the last time that President Obama came on an official visit to London and we were wondering what to do and he was going to go see the Queen at Windsor. I mean, do some sort of obvious things, see the Prime Minister. But we always, you have some wiggle room. And I said, look, I have to do something for young leaders UK. You know, like that's, because we've done. small things with them, but let's basically invite as many as we possibly can to do what we call in America, a town hall, like just a big thing and let people ask questions. And I know he loves that. You know, he could give a formal speech in front of a lectern, but he's really good at that. But like the world's seen a lot of that. Let's get, let's get real. So he was gracious enough. He said yes. We invited lots of Wylock folks to come. And it was great. And a young woman, a number of Wylock, I remember she asked a question on the back of the hall, which was basically the question you just asked. And I thought, oh, this is interesting. And I was like, well, he must have been asked something like that a lot in his career, you know. And again, he took kind of a longer time to think of an answer. And I remember he took off his suit jacket and he laid it down and rolled up his sleeves as he's thinking of what he's going to say. And then he said, be. is very lawyer lead to me, but he says, you ought to be predisposed to see the power in other people. And what I loved about, it stuck me just the way he phrased it, predispose to see the power in other people. And here he was, again, back to that first story sitting around the table. Like, he's good at lots of things, right? You're good at a lot of things. The people on this, but like you're at these places. is you've succeeded a lot already in what you're doing. And what I think has challenged to all of us is, and I have a little simple way of my little way I remember it, which is going to spell the word also, A-L-S-O. And so if you picture, if we are at a whiteboard, I would write the word also twice, first in all capital letters, and the second in all lower-case letters. and the capital letters are the stuff that everyone on was Zoom call are already good at, I would imagine, and by all means continued being good at that. But I think President Obama and I would add to this, his example and his challenge to that young woman that day, and I took it as my challenge too, is to develop the lowercase also, and I'll give you the words now. The stuff we're already good at, and certainly the things that we are trained, especially at your age, to do are to argue, to lecture, to lecture, to strategize, and to organize. Right? That spells also. And there's a time and place for all of those. I think we overdo those. Back to who likes to win an argument, you know? Why are we in the arguing, winning business? I don't think we are. And I know there's a time in place in our legal system for that, but most of life is not about winning arguments with other people. And so the other words that spell also are ask, listen, serve, and open up. And bringing that full circle. That is what President Obama, Senator Obama did around that table in Kentucky. Ask people about their hopes and fears. Listen and then sort of link it to your own. Serve that over. overlap, you know, because you don't have to agree with everything someone says, but just look for the Venn diagram overlap of what you're hopeful for and what I'm hopeful for. Let's work on that together. It's not a big group hug. It's okay to disagree and to differ. In fact, there's a lot of energy there. And then open up, as Brunei Brown would say, you know, be vulnerable. There's real strength and power and vulnerability. Being honest that I don't know, but maybe we might together. And so I used to write, you know, lowercase also just on a little A5 card to just always remind me of that in meetings. Because the cultures you will find yourself in, whether it's academia, whether it is the nonprofit world, if it's the world of government, if it's the world of corporations, any and all of those, I'm sure I've forgotten some, are much more hierarchical, even the ones that seem on the outside not to be. And what that does is it reinforces a whole set of habits that we're already good at. Who's in charge? What's the point? Where do I fit in? Who's in charge? What's the point? Where do I fit in? And we get so used to that kind of order that we start to lose sight of other kinds of women. And that's actually what I wrote my hook about. And the way I describe it is, and it's called the power of giving away power. but it's weird that I use the word power twice in my one short little title because that is a word I never used in my early career as a dot-com internet guy I never used that word in presidential politics and I studiously avoided using it in diplomacy just because it's such a loaded word don't you think rich I mean it's just like and then I was like yeah but I think we have to talk about power Because it's not like not talking about it, it makes you go away. And I think we all have a relationship to power and a problem with power. We see what happens when it's lorded over others. We see what happens when it's forwarded to ourselves. Better than having it lorted over, but I think it leads to alienation and isolation and paranoia with one another. And then even, and this is controversial a little bit, but like, I know what people say when they say, let's divvy it up and share it. I don't think that's right either because sharing it reinforces the idea that power is somehow a finite resource. There's only so much of it so that if you have 10 units and you share it with me, I get five and you're only left with five. And these leaders, President Obama's one, but my book is about these other ones, known and unknown. They all had the same insight, which he articulated in that meeting to that young woman. member of Young Writers, UK, which is power isn't a scarce resource, like something you mine, like coal and whales or Newcastle or Kentucky. It is something you make, and it is infinite if you make it with other people. And it all starts with this scary leap of giving the power away to other people so that you get it back again, so that you can give it away again. those are the sort of patterns and habits that have inspired me. I've been a witness to them in my life thus far and then have studied people who long since dead who also had that insight that President Obama had and then tried at the course of the book to say, hey, we can all put this into practice in our own lives if we want to. And the more of us that do that, the better the likelihood that we can make power together. Yeah, I think I know, Matthew, that in terms of your book, you've kind of drawn on different experiences that you've had, working with Obama, working as an ambassador. But I just wanted to ask, in terms of what inspired you to actually sit down and write this book, is there anything specifically that was your inspiration for it? I knew the antagonist. And so at the end, we picked the title of the book. But when I was writing it, it was called the pyramid versus the, and then it was just blank. I didn't know what the protagonist was called. But I knew that the pyramid, which to me is the symbol of hierarchy, it's on the back of a U.S. Dollar Bay. and it just stands for top down, bottom up, in out, up down, the exhaustion, winning, losing, just that whole mindset that I had seen. You know, in science class, we're taught about the conservation of energy in a closed system. And that's sort of true in the scientific limited sense. It is, I think, not at all true in the realm of human affairs, because human energy is either created and kindled when people get together, or it is stagnated and crushed and killed. And I became very sensitive to when people's energy was being snuffed out in meetings. You just see people turn off their life. And it's the opposite, like that Obama story, people just turning on their light and connecting with others and all their lights turning on and the room gets lit up. And I said magic before, and my editor hated that word magic. And I know because it's sort of a loaded word too. But like it's really energizing when you see people switch on. I get other people to switch on. And I was like, we can do that more. And why are we bringing so much misery to one another needlessly? Just in meetings. We're all on the same team even. You sit around and it's just joyless. And we don't have to do this. And once you've seen the good kind of way, you want to just do more of the good stuff. So that's really what led me to do it. So I knew the bad shape was the pyramid. I just didn't know what the good shape was. And then I'm sitting there, looking at the back of the dollar bill, looking at the pyramid. And I see this is very American, but if you can picture like a U.S. passport, I should have brought one with me. Actually, I have one. This is exciting. I'm in the airport. Okay. Tell me, can you see? that. Yeah, we can. Okay, so that's the, that's the eagle and all that stuff. But there's that funny thing above the eagle's head, which you've seen a lot. Americans see it a lot. No one ever knows what it is. So I didn't know what it was. It looks like a buzz ball. And so I went in research. It turns out it's called the radiant constellation. And originally it didn't used to look like that. It was 13 asymmetrical stars. And this is always tricky talking to you guys But if you go back to the Revolutionary War July 4th 1776 We declare independence from you guys Right And They formed a committee to design a logo For the United States that same day July 4th, 1776 And it took longer to design that logo I just showed even to win the war But they finally come up with that logo And I tell the story in the book And they care a lot about that. There was a formula for these things back then. And that thing above the eagle's head, the constellation, was for them the symbol of the best idea America has ever had. Which is, and underneath it is written, you couldn't see it there. Our national motto, which is Latin. I don't know if anyone here knows it, but it's e pluribus unum from many one. And that's how we were supposed to think about how you could be one, but also many. how you could have unity without uniformity, how you could get diversity without division. And this is a tricky thing. We could think of ourselves from many bricks, one pyramid, right? And in that world, I mean, it's a depressing world, but that's not what they did. They put that pyramid on the back of the logo. They put the constellation front end underneath that constellation that says from many ones. So we should think of ourselves at any scale, you with your fellow students in the union, people within Kentucky, how states within the United States deal with the federal government, all the stuff, you can think of it as the constellation where in the world of a constellation, you can stand out as an individual and fit into something bigger than just yourself. And in the pyramid, you either fit in or you're left out. And in the constellation of the world, you can do both. And I think whether it's COVID or look at our politics in your country or in my country, We are hungry for what we really want and need is to be able to stand out as our own selves, but not be isolated and alienated and be our true selves and fit in to something bigger than just ourselves. And not be forced to lose ourselves in some collective or be left all on our own. And that's what I think that symbol does. So finally, when I saw it's like, okay, so now it's not the pyramid versus the blank. It's the pyramid and the constellation. These two different ways of thinking, feeling, seeing, and behaving to, different ways of thinking of yourself and how you relate to others around you, not bottom up, where I'm below someone and above someone. We're all just stars, and then we have a choice about what connections we want to make between us. And that's probably a pretty good way to end it here at the top of the hour, because I really am grateful to you, Rachel, and for your team for including me in tonight's session, and you all are forming beautiful constellations there at the Student Union. You will go on to be parts of other constellations. in your amazing careers ahead. And I just wish you all amazing luck and positive energy in the road ahead. Thank you so much, Matthew. Honestly, it's been an absolute pleasure to talk with you this evening and hear more about your journey in your career, but also your book and how you've kind of channeled your beliefs through all of the great work you've done in different communities here in the UK, but also back where you are in America. I'm sure all the members have enjoyed this talk and event as much as I have. And yeah, thank you so much for coming, Matthew. Cheers, thanks, guys. And greetings from Muhammad Ali International Airport.
