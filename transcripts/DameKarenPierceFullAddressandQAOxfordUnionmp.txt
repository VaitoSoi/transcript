 Well, good evening, everybody, and thank you very much for coming. I'm walking in an odd way because the microphone keeps falling off, and then that would ruin the broadcast and and you're being able to hear me, but thank you very much indeed for inviting me to be part of this speakers series. This is a fantastic honour. I mean, I went to the other place, and they've never asked me to come and speak at the Cambridge Union, so we'll be sending a stern letter in the morning. But it's lovely to be here. It has such a distinguished history. That's my colleague Amy over there, who's an alumna of Keble College. Amy and I were just looking at some of your wonderful photographs including those of the Prime Minister when he was here so I think that speaks to the very deep history that is here but it is really such an honour and thank you so much to Michael and the committee for asking me I've been asked to talk about modern diplomacy which is a very varied subject so we can take that in any direction we feel like doing in the questions afterwards one thing I did want to say is that diplomacy itself is not very modern. It's quite hard to make it modern. I don't know if any of you are at the college where Tom Fletcher is the head in Oxford. He's come from the foreign office. He wrote a great book called The Naked Diplomat. I don't really know why I'm increasing his sales, but it's a very good book to read. And he really was the master of how to do diplomacy by social media, and not just communicating widely, but actually when he was in Lebanon, He was a real professional in the way he used social media to get the message across in Lebanon that leaders needed to do more to look after their people. I'm afraid I'm a much more traditional diplomat. I did, though, once hear Tom describe watching ambassadors tweet like watching your grandparents try to dance a rave and I think that's probably got the right balance in it. What I thought I might do though is just share some reflections that I've learned from my career illustrated by some of the places that I've been to and the President very kindly read those out. I'm going to start with Washington and the special relationship. Whether you like the term special relationship or not, I think there's no denying that it is the UK's single most important. bilateral relationship. And it is a very deep, profound and growing relationship. And I'll come on to the reasons for that. But when I first came to Washington two years ago, the UK and the US media were absolutely full of stories. Biden had just been elected. Biden would not like Boris Johnson, they would not get on. Northern Ireland would be a major issue, the United States best partner. was Germany. And actually, this was a perfect echo of 30 years ago, when I first went to Washington as a very young diplomat and worked directly for the ambassador, exactly the same stories were written about Bill Clinton and John Major, and they were again about Germany and about Northern Ireland. And then Ukraine comes along. In those days, it was Bosnia, and the world kind of reverts to a more familiar pattern. pattern of the special relationship which is quite interesting. So you know one thing I would say about diplomacy and it is described as the second oldest profession is what goes around comes around and you need to be ready for that but also that you can't take the Washington relationship for granted it needs investing in it needs to be strengthened and one of the main reasons for that is that between the UK and the US the common law that we share actually defines the relationship. It's a very permissive set of societies on both sides of the Atlantic and it is almost unique. Obviously Australia, Canada, they also have a legal system that fundamentally derived from English law many centuries ago. But it does change the way society is operating. It puts a huge emphasis on liberty and the free to do what you want and you will know that passage in the Constitution about life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that really does help define America and that emphasis on open societies is something I think we will hear a lot more of in the 21st century for reasons I'll come on to but fundamentally the 21st century is going to be a contest between open societies open markets with all their imperfections and the claspers but also the ruthlessness and the repression that comes with authoritarian regimes. So I think that's quite an interesting contest. And 80 years ago, FDR and Winston Churchill signed the Atlantic Charter. And it's commonly thought of as the beginning of NATO, and it did indeed go on to develop in that way. But almost more importantly, it was an effort to describe for ordinary people in Europe why the Nazis were a bad force, why they were evil, how they didn't bring benefits to ordinary citizens in the long run. And even today, when you think of Ukraine, it stands the test of time. And when President Biden made his first visit to the UK last June, we signed an updated version. Again, with that same end in mind, whatever the imperfections of open societies, they were. bring in the long run more benefits to their citizens. And interestingly, science was included in that and it was included in the FDR version. One of the things I learned when I was in Afghanistan was about the absolute importance of hard power. Now, not just soft power, it's not all about influencing, it's not all about persuading people to like the UK or persuading people to like your country. Unless it's backed by something really serious, then you won't get your aims through in an environment as difficult as Afghanistan. And as Ernest Bevan said, you know, don't go naked into the conference chamber and that still holds good in international politics today. It is of course a bit hollow in Afghanistan given the evacuation. And I have to say I watch that with enormous sadness. having worked on Afghanistan immediately after 9-11, when the Taliban were actually chased out of Afghanistan. And then I went back as ambassador. But you see also in Syria that the failure of the West to deliver on the airstrikes that it threatened, if Russia and Syria used chemical weapons, simply led worse things to happen in Idlib. and that still haunts the Democratic administration today in Washington. They are very wary of setting out red lines that might not get met because they understand that if you do that, if you threaten something and then you don't carry through, you have done enormous damage, not only to your own credibility, but actually to the rules-based system. So that's extremely important. And I think it's been well said of President Putin that he pushes the rapier in until it hits cold steel. Well, unless he gets some cold steel, and he didn't really get any with the invasion of Georgia, and he didn't get any with the annexation of Crimea, and now here we are with Ukraine. So I think that point about hard power is a difficult one for those of us who didn't grow up in a conflict environment to understand, but I would say it's one of the most important things we need as diplomats. I spent some time in Geneva, if you like, is the instrumentalized version of the UN in New York. It's where all the big agencies that do food and public policy and health and trade are based. It's not like New York. Decisions taken in Geneva affect the lives of millions of ordinary citizens around the world in a way that talking in the Security Council does not. so I really enjoyed being at the UN in Geneva. I had to say I didn't wholly enjoy being in Geneva. But the work was fantastic, and it taught me one very important thing on the trade side. And so this is my third lesson, and that's that the concept of fairness is actually universal. And forever in the trade and other negotiations, the word that kept coming round from every nation was fairness. Now, there's no international concern, consensus on what fairness means. There's no international consensus on what trust means. But those two commodities turn out to be incredibly important in international affairs. And it roughly translates for those of you who come from big families, as everybody must have something. And that's a very important principle to walk away with. It also helped show something that's become very evident in the last few years that the challenges of the 21st century, are rather different from those of the 20th with the world order that was put in place in 1925. You know, you have international structures and institutions that are in need of revitalization. Even the legal structures that we rely on in international affairs are creaking because you now have a greater proliferation of non-state actors, whether they're multinational corporations, whether they're civil society, or whether they're terrestrial. and the laws on the whole that govern international affairs were set up for a much more ordered and state-based world. And you have lots of new kids on the block, emerging powers, emerging markets. That's all good. They obviously deserve and want a seat at the table and we should adapt the institutions to make sure that they have one. But some of them are much more neo-realist than they're neoliberal. They believe much more in competition. in competition than in cooperation. So to a certain extent we are losing that sense in international affairs after the Second World War that what we were always going to strive for was cooperation and that needs to be that needs to be thought about. And then the other thing that Geneva taught me is that progress is not linear. You have to work for progress every week, every month, in international affairs and just one illustration of that maybe two. When Zimbabwe and Sienabwe and Sierra Leone gained their independence. They were thriving and prosperous economies. But Britain had to go back into Sierra Leone 30 years later, the invitation of the government to help them deal with their insurgent threat, the West Side Boys. And the other thing that always sticks in my memory is that Afghanistan gave women the vote a year before America did and look where that got them. So that, as I say, progress is not linear. have to try every day in international affairs to make that work. New technology, I think, is perhaps the one thing I would really highlight as an example of how 21st century challenges are changing. New technology, in my mind, it is the nuclear energy and power of the 1950s. It will require the same sort of principles and negotiations and agreements among major countries, just as nuclear power did, just as nuclear power led to the non-proliferation treaty. We are going to have to find a way to use new technology in a way that leads and enhances open societies and open markets and can't be used by authoritarian regimes to control their citizens. And again, I think that is going to be one of the fights of my professional lifetime, maybe even yours when you come to pick the career that you want. And lastly, I will mention Ukraine, it's on everyone's minds. The 21st century has seen, there's always been competition between Russia and China and the West, but what you're seeing now is a much more aggressive Russia and a much more assertive China. It's not just about Ukraine and Taiwan. They do see the current situation as an opportunity to say it's the end of the West. You may agree with that. You may want to agree with that. But I think if you use West in the sense of values, and you see what's happening on the human rights agenda, where human rights, LGBT rights, women's rights are getting pushed back all over the world, then that's a very dangerous thing that ought to occupy all of us, regardless of where you sit on the political spectrum. And they see it all as a competition to be a competition, to set the rules of international affairs. And so to come full circle, that's what we're engaged in in Washington. We want a solution to the Ukraine crisis, but it has to be a solution the Ukrainians want, and it cannot leave Mr. Putin stronger than when he went into this crisis. There has to be a price for invading another country and just coming over the border and committing what looked like war crimes. I will finish there. But very happy to talk to Michael and also take questions from all of you later. Thanks very much. Thank you very much for that opening remark, Dame. It's been a pleasure listening. Thank you. Just starting where you started, which is about the special relationship that we have with the United States. I want to dove a bit more deeper into that why you think this is the single most prolific bilateral relationship. What do you think makes it so valuable and so special in our relationship with the US? I think first of the first of we didn't always like each other. You know, it's not just the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812. I get one more joke about how the Brits burned the White House, but we did burn the White House. And I'm always very fond of saying in response that none of America would have been possible if we hadn't, so that usually gets a good laugh. But it shows actually how you can overcome history. We have a very strong trading relationship. is not generally known about but we are the biggest overseas supplier of jobs in America. So something like 1.7 million Americans go to work for a British company in America. And that, as I say, is a long way ahead. And not many people think of that, but we also have very similar financial and trading systems. And I think that's all borne out of the common law experience. It's permissive. It allows rules not to be overly heavy. It prefers light touch regulation to very strict prescriptions. So those reasons are also there. And then fundamentally after the second, well, we fought together very closely in the Second World War. We did in the first, but America had not yet fully come onto the world stage. We have always been a very close ally. We are what is called a day one night one ally, which means you can get up and go anywhere at a moment's notice together. And fundamentally shared experience really matters. There's a lot of healthy rivalry, but standing beside each other, whether you're a civilian or you're a military person in battle or in a conflict, means an awful lot. And Americans are very generous people. And if they see that you have shared an experience with them, they tend to embrace you. And that is one of the bedrock of the relationship. Definitely. Recipacy is really important and embedding up relationships. In light of that, I wondered what you thought of, I mean the recent fact that the Secretary of State Foreign Affairs has unfortunately rejected the plea from our close ally Joe Biden to rewrite the Northern Ireland Protocol and what you think these kind of blips or glitches would hold for our future relationships. Well I think it's interesting that when I first went to Washington 30 years ago, Northern nylon was one of the issues. Bill Clinton gave Jerry Adams his visa, which the American, any American administration, Democrat or Republican, had resisted until that point. That went down terribly badly in London, but in the end proved to be very helpful to the process that led to the Good Friday Agreement. What we're trying to do now is uphold the Good Friday Agreement. it's under threat because the unionist community in Northern Ireland feels very alienated from the rest of the UK and the protocol is contributing in a huge way to that because they aren't taxed the same way as people in the UK are, they don't have the same VAT rates, they can't get parcels, they can't move their pets, they can't buy the things they used to buy in the shops, they can't plant a tree for the Queen's Jubilee. All because of the restrictions, that flow from also being in the EU single market. Now it's a wholly good thing that they can be in the EU single market. You know, that protects another bit of the Good Friday Agreement. But in order to get the Northern Ireland government, the executive formed, we have to find a way to resolve those bits of the protocol that are proving tricky. The British government is absolutely open to negotiation with the EU. What the Foreign Secretary said was that she will be bringing forward legislation, That will take a while to get that legislation through Parliament. At every point we will be open to returning to the negotiating table with the EU because we'd rather have a negotiated settlement, but she will bring the legislation forward if we can't get one. That's very interesting. A lot of these blips, I guess, were born out of the recent changes four years ago. The people choosing to vote to come out of the EU, out of the EU and the relationship between US and America sort of like in a way strengthened to some regard. I wondered what you think right now, you know, four years on, how you view the impact of Brexit on how the UK relied on the US or perhaps how much closer we've become as a result of it? There was a lot of chatter when Britain voted to come out of the EU that we would not be useful anymore to the Americans. And at the same time, interestingly, there were some Americans who took it personally. They liked the notion of a European Union. They like the notion of that solidarity. And it's important to remember that the EU is the third largest economy in the world. So if you want to push back on some of what China is doing on unfair trade practices to have the EU in your camp is very helpful but the UK is the fifth largest economy in the world so to have us do that collectively is even more helpful now in Washington people don't talk about Brexit it's just accepted as a fact and it hasn't really impinged day to day but if you're an American strategist you used to know that in the European Union was a country that thought like you had very similar trade philosophy to you had a very similar security philosophy to you and could always be relied on to be on the open market side of the debate and that was the UK and with the UK out of the European Union no single other country carries that identity if you like that the Americans can can chime with so that for them is a genuine issue of one of their points of national economic interests but fundamentally you Ukraine has made everybody work harder. We have done sanctions, not just with the Americans, but also with the EU. We have cooperated on energy, UK, US, EU. We cooperate on human rights at the UN, and that's actually very useful because a United Kingdom that can bring its own legislation forward is obviously not as big as the EU, but it's very nimble and we can do it quickly. So when you put all of that together, you can actually do quite a lot for human rights at the UN. That's really good and I think Ukraine has been quite a poignant but an important scenario and from your view what do you think the UK role has been in solving the current war in Ukraine in a much in-depth view? I'd like to think it was solved you know there's a lot more work to do. I think right from the start both Boris Johnson and the Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretaries saw this in very historical terms, you know, countries in Europe, which is the most overly-lawyered region of the world for stability packs and security agreements in human rights mechanisms and dispute mechanisms. If this could happen in Europe, then that was a threat to the world anywhere. And it also showed Russia's true colors, or President Putin's true colors. And I think that goes back to what I was saying about pushing the rapier in till it hits cold steel. we weren't strong enough to contest that in 2008 and 2014. So I think very much for the Prime Minister, that's seen in historical terms. And so he was determined that this invasion would not go the way of Crimea. But also you had very similar echoes of that in the US. This is about the freedom and sovereignty of another country. It's a country in Europe, as I say, European stability has long been one of the big prizes of the Berlin Wall coming down in the 1990s, and people didn't want to jeopardize that. Yeah, I think it's interesting how you pointed out this is more post-Puton's war rather than Russia's war, and on both sides is unseen in very sad casualties occurring. What role do you think that we can play in the UK or is the government, led by Boris, in effecture it in some form of diplomatic relation between Russia as a state? and Ukraine in a way that could move things positively forward. I think Ukrainians need to be in the lead. It's their country. They contemplate negotiations, but they don't trust the Russians. They are doing very well on the ground, so from a hard power perspective, negotiate with a strong hand, not a weak one, but there's more they want to do to push the Russians back in eastern Ukraine. And they are doing very well. We have been supplying defensive weapons to them. We have been helping them with training for a long time. There's more of that that can be done. I think to be honest, if one were looking for a mediator, and it's not obvious that both sides want that. It's not obvious Putin would come to the table, then I don't think that would be the UK. Since the Salisbury poisonings by the the Russian military intelligence wing, we have not had a load-bearing relationship with the Russians. So I don't think that would be the UK, but we stand ready to support any process that could be got off the ground. We're ready to help the Ukrainians with capabilities if they need it. You've seen a couple of countries. Israel was one. Hungary has been another. try and go to Moscow and try and open up space for negotiation. And that just hasn't worked. You've seen the Secretary General go of the United Nations, took a long time for Moscow to let him in. So that's just not very promising at the moment, but it doesn't mean we don't think about it and try and find a way. Absolutely. And the sentiment of standing ready in the face of Putin's action is something that's probably rang through in a lot of of leaders' minds, quite recently, Joe Biden preempted and highlighted how the US would react, should China choose to attack Taiwan. In the light of this, I wonder what you thought on the position of the UK, should they make similar statement on a former British colony such as Hong Kong? We've made no secret of the fact that we believe China has broken the treaty that governs the agreement on Hong Kong. It's called the Joint Declaration. It's actually an international treaty. Britain offered residency to about three million Hong Kong people. They have passports that mean they can come to the UK to live. We continue to call China out on the human rights aspects of that. The Americans are also very strong on that. any of you who know Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the House of Representatives, she's very fierce about Hong Kong and we'll continue to do that. I think already the Chinese, because they took Hong Kong back in 97, it's not the same situation for them as Taiwan. They believe they already do control it and you see from the people they put into Hong Kong to be the government that they're standing that up in a more repressive and restrictive way. Yeah. Going on to much more immediate stuff that occurred recently, in your opening statement you highlighted how the common law that we share with United States is one of the many reasons why we have a special relationship and a lot of reflections and inflections in how we relate to each other. But something quite isn't the same and that's obviously how we govern our country. I think it was it yesterday or today, and there was quite a sad shooting in UVA, Texas. And I wanted to get your opinion, if you can, share, on reforming gun laws in the US and specifically how you think that maybe lessons could have been learned by them from us. It was, you're absolutely right. It was a totally senseless and shocking shooting, no justification for it. The president has come out and made a very moving speech, there's widespread condemnation right across the political spectrum. This debate, though, has gone on in America for a long time. Those who favor the current situation point to articles in the Constitution. It is a libertarian country in many ways. It's also a frontier country. There's still something of that sense of the Lewis and Clark expedition and rolling back the frontiers of America as you move from East Coast to the Pacific and that's very ingrained in the psychology of a large number of communities and they see it very much as their responsibility to protect their families not as we would say the police or the state so you have a different philosophy there and it is just something that Congress are going to have to get to grips with Interestingly, when I was doing some work on the Supreme Court, for most of the 20th, that second half of the 20th century, gun control was quite restrictive in America. It was quite widespread, and then there was a Supreme Court judgment that overturned that, and then we have the situation we have now. Whether or not the Biden administration will be able to use this awful episode, episode to make progress on its stated aim of gun control. I just don't know. It's such a visceral issue for so many Americans. Thank you. Just going on to talk about you a bit more. You've been the president of the UN Security Council several times. You're the first woman who is the permanent representatives to the United Nations from the UK. And I think you replaced Lord Darac of Q as the first woman to be the UK's ambassador to the US. So you've exceeded beyond measure in the upper echelands, but also being a woman first in all these levels. Where would you say in your career your successful elements come from, if you go back to your childhood or where would you say your driving and sort of like hustle comes from? That's a very good question. When I was a kid, I was a real girl. You know, I like dresses, I like pretty things. I was never a tomboy, but I always read boys' books because I didn't want the boys at school to know things I didn't know or stories about how the way the world works and all that sort of thing. That sounds very sexist, but it's better than it sounds, but they were always books about hard power fundamentally. And I liked military hardware, which is also very strange. And I used to draw fighter jets in art class. So I've always been interested in this exercise of power, and I like winning, and I don't like being beaten. And fundamentally, I don't think it's any more psychological than that. But I was lucky enough to have some really good mentors in the Foreign Office. When I joined, there weren't very many senior women, but there were a number of men who were very keen to help and be helpful. Some of them went on to run the Foreign Office. so I'm very grateful to them. And then the thing that took me to Kabul, because I really wasn't sure about doing something so dangerous, and I wasn't sure I'd be able to do it because you have to leave your family, and at the time it was a very security dangerous environment. So even though I'd worked on Afghanistan after 9-11, I wasn't sure. And then I remembered that one of my bosses had written on my, one of my evaluation form, she's destined to be the most senior woman the foreign officers ever had, which I thought was very clever, because it didn't actually say what that would be, simply that it would be senior. And I thought, if I don't go to Afghanistan, I can't fulfil what he was kind enough to write. And in the end, I went, and I was very glad it's the hardest thing I've done, but it was good to do. And in terms of being in Washington, it gives me a lot of street credit, people who have to make these decisions in very difficult circumstances about conflicts around the world. Thank you. I've got another compact question coming up and just highlighting you grew up in Preston, Lackenshire, grand daughter to millworkers and but then you went on to study at Gerton College, Cambridge, English. And two questions here. Do you think, what's your thoughts on social mobility in the UK and how do you think social mobility in your respect got activated and would you blame the education system or where would you put credit? I think I have a number of responses probably competing with each other so I'll just try and you know maybe we can talk about this later. I really hate it when people say there has to be someone who looks like me in order for me to succeed. someone's got to smash the glass ceiling, it might as well be you. So please don't let that put you off. I know it can be in gender, a lack of confidence, but don't let it put you off because someone's got to be first. So I think that's valid wherever you come from, whatever the background. I don't think society has yet worked out where it wants to draw the line on social mobility. You know, people who say if you go to Oxbridge, you shouldn't be allowed into the civil service. Well, you might have come from one of the poorest places in the UK and your parents and family and friends might be fantastically proud that you got to Oxford. So why on earth should that prevent you going on to help run the country? So I think we as a society, we're a bit confused about what we want to do. America is very interesting on social mobility because it throws huge emphasis onto the universities and it has a lot of what are called needs-blind programs to help kids get to universities from backgrounds that wouldn't normally see them go there. They are also putting enormous effort into community colleges so that people who really can't get to university can learn a skill at the community college, and they have a system now across several states of partnering with big employers in those states to make sure that the people who go to community college get the skills that will get them the job. And that sort of organization, I think we could probably do with something like that. You know, the prime minister is very genuine when he talks about leveling up. But it's interesting that the Americans, which in many ways are a more libertarian and laissez-faire society actually have things in place that we're anxious to learn from. So Michael Gove, former president, Michael Gove is coming out precisely to look at whether there's something we can learn from the Americans on this. And also share some of the things we do. They're very interested, for example, in how we tackle homelessness. Definitely. I'm keen to open up, I've got lots to ask you here, but I'm keen to open up to questions so we don't want out of time and I don't have a little. repeat of law sugar yesterday. Does anyone want to indicate if they have any questions? I recognize the member there. Could you stand up when you answering thank you? Do you see diplomatic ties is something that changed very rapidly perhaps when there's a new government in a country or are they something that are based on values in history and very slow to change? Is this just about America or about anywhere? more generally, yeah. On the whole, they continue. The British government has a practice of recognising states, not governments. So we still have an embassy in Moscow, for example. It's closed at the moment because of COVID, but we did have an embassy in North Korea. Even when a friendly government changes in other countries, we keep our embassies there. You know, my colleague, in Hungary, say, sometimes has a hard time, but the whole point is to build what relationships you can. One of the things that we have a huge problem with, I ought to have added it to my lessons, which I learnt from the UN, is we're very good at talking to people who think like we do. We're not so good at talking to people who completely disagree with us and trying to see if there is any common ground there. Now, you know, I'm not obviously talking about President Putin in this respect, although it was possible to find common ground with the Russians on second order issues. But we put a huge amount of effort into getting groups together at the UN on human rights say. And if you go and talk to the Brazilians, they have a different approach. Well, we might get further if we were able to bring them in to at least some cooperative work on certain aspects. So that's one of the things we definitely want to do at the UN now, just broaden the dialogue and the partnerships to see if we can get further. Thank you. Sure, the speaker with black jacket. Hi, I just wondered, in your opening remarks, you addressed the issue of hard power and also the expansion of China. And I just wondered if the fact that we've, cut diffid and as a incorporated into the foreign office as a whole are we surrendering almost to like Chinese soft power expansion in or other countries in places like Africa and kind of taking a backseat and moving towards more of a hard power order I don't know if you caught the Foreign Secretary's speech at Mansion House recently but she was talking about the return of geopolitics so that's exactly the sort of question we need to look at the two things that are separate the Chinese were starting a big campaign belt and road particularly in developing countries when we were still had diffid as an independent ministry and paid 0.7 in in official development assistance partly in the Ukraine context partly in the energy climate context we and the Americans and now the rest of the G7 are very keen to develop an offer for developing countries with money behind it to help them make sustainable infrastructure investments. But in my opinion, we're too slow. You know, the Chinese are over a lot of the globe at the moment with their offer. Their offer isn't sustainable in the long term because it brings countries more and more into debt. And the country that argues hardest in G20 against debt relief is China. That's not often known about, but it's an important part. But we have been slow to get a better offer out there. Nevertheless, the G7 and others are now working on that. On Diffid, it has been brought into the Foreign Office, and we have a temporary drop from 0.7 to 0.5. But there is a commitment when the economy improves to go back to 0.7. In theory, it ought to make us more useful to developing countries to be able to marry the diplomatic and the development because what has been happening is that we will make commitments but then the money is going on a completely different project on the ground so this should make us more coherent and better able to deliver but we're settling down getting used to living in the same building with each other at the moment thank you i recommend speaker with a brown jacket hi thanks so much for being here my question is um in your current post what is the most um challenging piece of work that you've undertaken and also what's the most unexpected aspect of being ambassador um most challenging is when you have to go and see congress I think and argue a position you know they disagree with. And you have to argue it seriously because Congress being a third pillar of the American system, it has the power of initiative, it can pass resolutions and laws, it doesn't need the administration. So if we want something on trade, for example, you have to go and convince people who are diametrically opposed to what you're asking for, at least not to vote against you or at least not to put something unhelpful in a resolution. And that can be really hard pounding, to be honest. I've also been caught out a couple of times on TV, so you have to think really fast on your feet. What's the most surprising thing? I don't know. I'd seen the Washington Embassy before when I was a junior a diplomat so I had some idea of what it's like in in Washington it has a very special way of doing things it's back to the power again so that wasn't surprising but it's something you need to bear in mind I do have to share that I recently went out to the aircraft carrier that they have in the Atlantic and saw F-18's taking off which was just they were we were as close to them as I am to and I have to say that wasn't surprising but it was fantastic so hopefully that will do. Thank you. Do you have any more questions from the audience? Yes I recognise a member with a blue jacket. Cheers, so a couple of questions sort of tied into one. Do you think that the Security Council is effective when you consider you consider the vetoes given to the P5 and do you think that the P5 should be changed expanded or got rid of or anything like that thank you I think the first thing to say is that the P5 have a veto on whether they can be got rid of so it's an academic question in that sense the veto has been used very unfortunately mainly by Russia but it is the price of having a United Nations if you think of what happened to the League of Nations which just ran out of steam and into the sand and was hopeless in the 1930s. If the big Paris didn't have the veto the UN would have gone the same way and the Security Council has been able to deal quite effectively with second order issues and at times very effectively so it was very slow on Bosnia nothing on Miranda but eventually set up war crimes tribunals and eventually authorised a protection force for Bosnia. So it can, at its best, still be relevant. There are moves to try and change the membership of the permanent members, not change it, but expand it. That is held up by the Africa group, which cannot agree how many seats they want for Africa, and that is stopping the four of them, runners who are Germany, Brazil, India and Japan, from being able to find a formula to expand the Security Council permanent membership. I think it's fair to say that also their neighbours are not necessarily overjoyed at the thought that those countries might get on the Security Council with permanent membership. So there are a lot of different wheels within wheels, but because the procedures are so complicated, it means changing the UN Charter, it's very difficult to see movement. But the British government is very happy to see movement. And we take part in the debate and we've said we're ready to see the permanent membership expanded. And we try and collaborate to find a way forward. We're not doing, you know, we're not making progress, I have to be honest. But in principle, we are ready to do that. I was thinking as a follow up, giving your experience as a rep to the UN and, you know, your expertise and understanding the Charter in a way that I can never imagine doing so. How would you respond to people directly who have lost faith in the UN as an institution? From my perspective of just a layman thinking that what's the point of this United Nations, what do they do? I think I would point to the war crimes tribunals. I would, you know, every single person who is indicted by the War Crimes Tribunal for Bosnia is now either dead or in jail so that's that's over 50 and the ICC has now been set up and is looking into war crimes in Ukraine it's not straightforward it can be controversial for some countries but nevertheless there is an international justice mechanism I would point to the great work that the agencies do on health on trade on public policy on communications for example you know that there are these big UN agencies are really taking decisions that affect the lives of ordinary citizens. If you think of the Ebola response and if we'd got our act together collectively sooner, we'd have had a better response on COVID. Nevertheless, on the whole, the World Health Organization has been right at the center of that. And in New York, they are trying to get to grips with the food security problems caused by Ukraine and if in the end we can get the grain out of Odessa it will be because the UN has managed to take the lead and organize countries to do that thank you I recognize the member with a brown jacket thank you I was just wondering if you could speak more specifically about how your experience as a woman has colored your occupation and participation at a traditionally male table. Also, if you have any advice for women looking to step onto the stage of the global politics. So as I was explaining earlier, I really liked military staff. So I was very happy to go into what we call politico military work when I came back from my first posting, which was Tokyo. And I enjoyed that. And to be absolutely crude about it, it works for you in that environment as much as it works against you. people know who you are, they're prepared to listen to you, and as long as you're ready to put the position of your department, then in my experience, that has always worked pretty well. As I said before, I don't like being beaten, so if someone is rude to me or tries to discriminate or something, I usually don't let the meeting end without doing something about it, about it, which might not be a fight. In fact, it shouldn't be a fight. Charm and conciliation is the best advice I've ever heard. It was given to my son at school by his teacher. But it's very good. If you can turn your feelings of hurt and anger and irritation into a joke or something that puts you on top, as it were, that is good for you psychologically, and it helps you win the argument. I do think moving away from this, you can't be what you can't see. Don't let that stop you. But it's always a good idea to have some people you can go to for advice. They don't have to be formal mentors. Most people like being asked for advice. You know, we can get very shy about it. And I think particularly if you're a woman, someone in the foreign office had a good face. They said, nice girls don't ask boys out. It's actually quite hard to go to a senior person, and ask for advice. And the first time you do it, you might get the wrong answer. And that applies to men as well as women. You know, it's just quite hard. But there'll be people who want to help you and people who are happy to share. So I would say, don't be discouraged. Definitely charm and conciliation if you can. And then I also love the... It'll be all right in the end, and if it's not all right, it's not the end. And that's quite a good thing to bear in mind as well. that helps. Thank you very much. I think we have time for one more question. I recognise the member with a blue dress. Thank you so much so I want to ask two questions. So what would you say are the key traits in being an effective negotiator? And secondly, so last week we had a debate which was this house would abolish borders. We had a debate last week which was this house would abolish borders. So I wanted your take on that. Would you support the abolition of borders and like the dissolution of nation states is the organising unit. If you abolish borders, Amy and I won't have a job, so we don't like that. So we're not in favor of that. I like organization. So you need an organizational principle, its borders. The economist once wrote an article about 20 years ago arguing that proposition. And I think they got more letters complaining about it. and someone said something like, if it weren't for the redeeming wit of your prose, the utter balderdash in that article. So it generated a lot of heat and light, but not in the end any great substance. What are the traits? You need to listen. You need to read a room. To be a negotiator specifically, as opposed to a diplomat, you need to be able to read the room, and you need to know when to do that. take things outside a room, do them bilaterally, do them in small groups, go to capitals, etc. But above all, I think the single most important trait is to be able to listen and to be able to put yourself in the other person's shoes and understand their motivations. That's not to say you have to agree with those motivations, but sometimes they're driven by just a different set of values and if you can understand that then as we were saying earlier you can find a piece of common ground even with the russians thank you so much thank you so much unfortunately that's all we have time for today it's been a real pleasure and i'm so grateful for you's coming through before i end tonight's event i'd like to announce that the motion didn't carry in that event and so the house voted against division of board so your job is quite safe would we all Join me in thanking Alder Day for joining us today. Oh no. Well, thank you, Mr. Satterton. Thank you. Thanks very much, everybody.
