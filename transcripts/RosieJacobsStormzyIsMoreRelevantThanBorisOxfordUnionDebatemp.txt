 Right, to open this debate and I'll look to Rosie Jacob, elected member of Secretary's Committee, St Anne's College. Thank you. Good evening members and thank you Mr President. So for a person to be relevant, they must be significant to a person or a situation. The first thought that came to my mind when I read this definition was that the opposition are defending a man who is neither relevant to his own children nor believes his own laws are of any relevance to him. But my argument will extend further than this personal critique. It is quite clear to me and hopefully it will be to all of you later that Storms E is far more relevant than Boris. And it is important to note that this debate motion encapsulates the tension between the wider Grime industry and the Conservative Party politics. However, it is not a debate fought between Labour and Conservative. It is one in which Grime has a distinct role to play, which often opposes Conservative policy, yet is not dominated by this idea. It is quite clear to me that Boris's career is dwindling, yet while his legacy is ebbing, Grime is here to stay. Boris Johnson's popularity, according to YouGov, stands at 30% while Stormsies, according to the very same website, is six percentage points higher. Or more notable, Boris Johnson was directly elected in 2019 with 25,000 votes. Stormzy has 4.7 million people listening to his music every month on Spotify alone. But if the numbers aren't enough, I will make three further points. Firstly, the appeal of Grime to the disenfranchised and disengaged. The very real issues Grime is targeted, which the government retreats from, and artist's ability to hold the government to account. But before I do this, the honour falls to me to introduce our speakers on the side of the opposition. The first speaker is fresher at Christchurch College, Lucas. And now I would tell you to trust and respect him, but then he showed me his Tinder profile. Secondly, we have Jonathan Ilan, senior lecturer in criminology at the University of London, and he has published works on the criminalisation of journal music. Now I never thought I'd see the day a man gave up some of his paternity leave to defend Boris, a man who doesn't even have a life with his own children, but here we are. And thirdly, the third speaker for the opposition is Anaya I, Amman, the creator and host of the discussion on G.B. News and founder and director of the Equiano Project, a forum to promote open dialogue on the subjects of race, identity and culture. So let me just clarify, a G.B. News presenter feels equipped to talk about relevance. And finally, we have Sheldon Thomas. The chief executive of the Gangs Line Foundation Trust, a non-profit organisation established to assist young people involved in gang culture, and he has advised Scotland Yard, the Home Office and Theresa May. I guess he epitomises the saying, Nice guys always finish last. Mr President, these are your guests, and they are most welcome. Grime is and has been recognized as a voice for the voiceless. Often the government fails to engage the diaspora among which Grime has an unequivocal appeal. The language which Grime Music focuses on specifically resonates with a young black audience and other groups which find themselves ostracized by Tory elitism. And while I admit that I cannot speak on this in its entirety based on my own experiences, I too have experienced an emotional connection with Grime music and have observed the consequences of this appeal both politically and socially. Even those embassed into the British political realm of Westminster can understand the relevance of grime music and have adopted it for political ends, as they understand that in this area, politicians are incapable of getting the same reception. Jeremy Corby himself recognised this when he utilised his crime support to increase his voter appeal. JME appeared in a YouTube video with Corbyn discussing social exclusion and deprivation prior to the 2017 election, and A.J. Tracy, Stormsy, novelist, and Akala, all supported Corbyn publicly. There was also Grime for Corbyn, a website launched to increase voter registration and participation. The impact of this was seen in real terms. In 2017, turnout among BME voters stood at 54%, a six-point swing from 2015, and this was a 16-point swing among 18 to 24-year-old. This turnout increase was specific to this group, the group most impacted by the grime industry and most exposed to artist social media. There is therefore little justification to the argument which I'm sure the opposition will make that Stormsie is not relevant politically, nor is this argument true of legislative influence. MPs utilise the political message embedded in rap songs and acknowledged grimes resounding relevance by referring to them in the House of Commons. Sarah Jones MP brought light to Theresa May's failure in 2017, stating that politicians should be careful as you're never too big for the boot. And Labour MP, Dawn Butler, also sought greater protection of pre-existing social equality measures by declaring, Mr. Speaker, we have to be honest. Rule number two, don't make the promise. If you can't make the deal, just be honest. Equalities will never die. It's like Chuck Norris. Rather, chuck this government and Chuck Boris. This is not only exemplary of the very relevance of Grime, and it's wide audiences, but both these instances created media buzz which boosted Grimes, political relevance and the relevance of the issues it was used, it was utilised to expose. And while the opposition's point is also likely grounded in the notion that Boris is relevant on account of him being the executive and leader of the largest party in Commons, this makes him irrelevant on one major political aspect. He is not relevant when it comes to holding the government to account. I urge those of you who haven't, which I'm sure will be few, to listen to some of the most blatantly political songs, most of which belong to the grime genre. Dave's question time criticized Theresa May on issues of immigration, war, social welfare and the Grenfell Tower fire. Most emotionally, he references his mum when he says, I just find it that the government is struggling to care for a person who cares for a person. And Dave is not alone. Novelist is another example of many. His tracks include taxi MPs and a sample of David Cameron's speech with lie, lie a pants on fire repeated over the top of it. Dave also gave a performance of the song Black at the 2020 Brit Awards, the biggest night in British music. This segued into a direct criticism of the government in which he called out our Prime Minister for being a real racist. Grime artists touch on real issues and call out politicians on a very public scale, a trait which I cannot ascribe to Boris. Stormy similarly called out the Conservative Government at the 2018 Brit Awards asking the government, where's the money for Grenfell? Theresa May acknowledged this through a spokesperson's response which declared that the government had pledged millions. This acknowledgement of Stormsies questioning represents Grimes' relevance and the fact that the government felt required to respond displays their awareness that the Grime industry has the ability to bring disrepute on them. A recognition of Stormsies' relevance over the Conservative Party. Of course, this isn't about direct political power. It is an argument which extends further than this and transcends political allegiances. It is based on the learnt truth that artists such as Stormsey do not have to sit in the commons, they do not have to directly legislate in order to influence the political agenda and public opinion. But Grime also has a greater relevance than just a political one. It has a real societal impact. Stormsie has proven this through social endeavours from his funding for black students to attend Cambridge University without taking out loans. The funding has gained support from HSBC and so he has gained support from HSBC and so has now been extended to 30 students. He's also pledged 10 million pounds to black enterprises and charitable initiatives over the next 10 years and is currently funding paid writing internships alongside Penguin House Publishing as part of his Mercky Foundation. It's his grime artists who are contributing to society in a way which allows individuals to thrive as well as survive. And this has an overall impact on society as well as a hugely personal one to the individuals who are recipients. This focus level of involvement is something which politicians have proven incapable of matching. As a member of this House, this House whom the motion is proposed to, this House which is voting, a house predominantly constituted of the young audience grime music is aimed at, as well as my mother, who has been known to write fan mail today, sorry, for baiting you out, Mum, the relevance of grime is something directly applicable to you. claiming that Boris is irrelevant, but Grime touches us on a personal level. It also touches us politically. It is what we listen to every day. Grime artists are the individuals we hear about in the news and see on social media. It is of songs taking up our TikTok feeds, and whether you like it or not, it is influencing today's political climate and the way we behave and interact. Grime is the modern art of today, and as Winston Churchill, argued so well in World War II when he rejected the reallocation of arts funding for the war effort. If arts were to be abandoned, then what would we be fighting for? Art is what makes life worth fighting for. It comes before the government. And so, I strongly urge you to vote for the proposition, as not only is it right, but it is also a stand. Fog the government and fuck Boris. Thank you.
