 Hi everyone. I'm Minky Warden, and I oversee Human Rights Watch's work on sport and human rights worldwide. At Human Rights Watch, we use sport and we research human rights abuses caused by sport, and we also attempt to use sport as a positive force for change. to increase inclusion to stop racism and to stop homophobia. Many of you in this house were young in 2012, but you likely remember the Olympics in London that summer. Over the eight years before the Games, London was a massive infrastructure project, with thousands of construction workers building dozens of new sports stadiums. Mr. President, I have a question. for this house. How many workers died building the facilities for the London Olympics? Any ideas? Correct. Zero. Zero workers died building the London Olympics. The World Cup that opens in Qatar this month, one month from tonight, in fact, with fireworks, fanfare, and even David Beckham, is a very different story. The number of migrant worker deaths in Qatar is not measured in the dozens, it's not measured in the hundreds, it's instead measured in the thousands. Qatar imports millions of migrant workers to do its construction, domestic, and service work. So the dead were migrant workers, meaning people who came to Qatar to make a living so that their families back home could have a chance at better lives. Millions of migrant laborers, more than 90 percent of Qatar's workforce, were needed to build the $220 billion in new construction for the World Cup, over the last 12 years, deadly heat. This infrastructure includes eight new stadiums and expansion of the airport, new hotels, housing, rail, and highways to football venues. $220 billion is the highest price tag ever for any sporting event. Yet, as we've heard tonight, the human cost has been even higher. In 2010, when the World Cup was awarded, FIFA did no human rights due diligence and set no conditions to protect migrant workers, women, journalists, LGBT people, or others. Football leaders knew or should have known about Qatar's exploitative labor sponsorship system. It's a form of modern-day slavery known as Khafala. In Qatar, temperatures can reach more than 100,000. more than 120 degrees Fahrenheit. That's 50 degrees Celsius. Indeed, this deadly heat prompted FIFA to move the tournament from summer to winter to protect athletes. That was the right decision. But FIFA took no such care with the lives of millions of migrant workers who were building its flagship World Cup. Under pressure from an ILO forced labor complaint in 2017, Qatar eventually put in place some important labor reforms, including a minimum wage, allowing workers to change jobs, and mostly removing the abusive exit permit. Since 2020, Qatar has set up a workers support fund that has compensated 36,000 workers from 17 countries, a total of 164 million U.S. dollars. But these reforms were too little, too late, and failed. to address the many migrant worker deaths that happened in the decade before 2020. Meanwhile, it has become a full-time job for drivers in Nepal to pick up coffins at the airport and drive bodies of workers who died in Qatar home to grieving families in the poorest villages. So to those who want to boycott, I asked, who is going to compensate these families? The fact that thousands of migrant workers died is not in dispute. What to do about it is. A compensation fund, and we have only four weeks before the opening of the World Cup to set it up, so it's a true deadline. A compensation fund is the only available remedy for these grieving families. Nothing will bring back their breadwinners, so financial compensation is the only practical approach. And it's one that sends a message sport will no longer tolerate preventable deaths building glass. amorous edifices to football. Calls to boycott the World Cup in Qatar because of human rights abuses, the lack of LGBT rights, the lack of women's rights are perfectly understandable. And Human Rights Watch defends everyone's right to advocate for a boycott. But in this case, the boycott places the burden to act on fans and players, people who love football, not on the two powerful entities that are playing. plainly responsible and should be held accountable. That's the Qatari authorities and FIFA. As Lucas said, why should athletes and sports fans who love the game or for whom it's their job have to boycott the World Cup because FIFA has granted the games without any human rights protections? Fans and players do have a vital role. They can instead leverage their clout and their economic power by demanding FIFA and Qatar set up a remedy fund to compensate workers who were cheated, who are indebted, or the families of those who died. Let me tell you a story about one of those families, and this is a family story that illustrates all three of those things. Kripal Mandal died of a heart attack in Qatar in February 2022, so just this year. The only legacy of the World Cup for his family is the outstanding loans that he took out to pay for the job he died doing. Mundell's family told my colleagues at Human Rights Watch that he worked in construction for a supply company that assigned him to the airport and stadiums. This means his family should be entitled to what we call remedy under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, which FIFA adopted in the year 2016. However, the family did not receive any compensation for his death. In addition to crushing loans that he, took to pay out, paying to work in Qatar. Mandal's employer didn't even pay the 15 days of salary he was contractually owed. Manjudevi, his wife and the mother of his five children, told Human Rights Watch, When Kripal was alive, there was an assurance that someone earns. Now our breadwinner is no longer alive. It is very difficult. I'm sorry the families of migrant workers who died cannot be with us in this house tonight, to tell you about the economic hardship that leads them to send beloved family members away for years to earn for their children's future. As Lewis said, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Migrant Labor groups, and there are dozens in this coalition, have called on FIFA and Qatar to set aside an amount equivalent to the World Cup prize money of $440 million. We've also called for a migrant worker center to entrench the labor reforms that I described earlier that have been passed in the last two years. What would a fund mean for struggling migrant worker families? If we assume 15,000 such deaths, a $440 million fund would mean just under $30,000 per lost worker. Deeply meaningful for the families, but hardly a fortune. could pay off debts, send kids to school, and feed them. It could keep the next generation out of child labor and child marriage. But perhaps as important, a major remedy fund would also be a warning for future mega sporting events hosted by countries that fail basic human rights tests. For global sport, the year 2022 has been a sobering reminder of who has sports watched. The year open with the Beijing Olympics in China, the 2018 World Cup host Russia rolled tanks into Ukraine, and on the horizon, there is more reason to worry. Saudi Arabia recently announced it is bidding to host the 2030 World Cup, together with Egypt and Greece. Saudi Arabia may expect to take a page out of the Qatari playbook. Few protections for millions of migrant laborers who would build stadiums in deadly heat. Saudi Arabia has no labor unions, does not recognize LGBT rights, and the proposed co-host Egypt has a long history of jailing and torturing LGBT people. A word to Thomas Beatty saluting your courage and your position. Football and sport has put inclusion and human rights into the statutes and into its practices worldwide, but the practices of FIFA have not caught up. And it's really up to fans, players, those who care about the sport to use the ambition of some of the world's worst human rights abusers to host these large events against them, to change the laws, the policy, and the culture that denies people their basic human rights. Saudi Arabia clearly hopes to sports wash away its terrible record, but today, football players increasingly say they don't want to play the most important games of their careers in stadiums, workers died to build. Fans don't want to stay in hotels where staff are cheated of their wages or where same-sex couples are not welcome. National Football federations like Germany, Denmark, and the U.S. are increasingly adopting their own human rights policies. And four of FIFA's main corporate sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Budweiser, McDonald's, and Adidas have backed a remedy fund. FIFA and Qatar cannot bring back migrant workers to their families, but the least they can do is set up a compensation fund now to support the families who made sacrifices so we can all watch great football. Thank you.
