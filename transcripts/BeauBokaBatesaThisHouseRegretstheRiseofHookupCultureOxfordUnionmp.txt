 OK. Thank you, Mr. Acting President, for giving us the utmost privilege to speak on a topic that we care most dearly about. And friends who have come down to watch this all unfold tonight, thank you for being here. I'm so glad you came. I would also like to send a special thanks to India, who were actually invited myself to speak on this debate, so it's really nice to see. like a friend from Enz, actually like be here. So, and just a massive thanks to her. Her speech was just bloody amazing. It's just nice to see you on my side. Anyways, back to the actual debate. As someone who's actually had a shag in the past week, we do believe... We do actually believe that this house should not regret the rise of hookup culture. You see, hookup culture, There is something that paints itself differently for others, and so the essential thing to discuss is how casual sex affects marginalised perspectives. And so tonight, we'll platform queer ones. I'm in asexual myself, so that's a lot to discuss it. And so furthermore, I will explore the fact that we need to remedy the heterosexual and the patriarchal ideals pressured onto queer and female presenting people like me, because we're all here for a good time and not a long time. A bit of sad news. We actually got broken up the other day by text, which I can't lie, it was a bit of a long day. And so we'll come back to how language and barriers are so important in debates like these. And so I hope you come away from these chambers as stronger allies, acknowledging that hookup culture can be appreciated in a queer lens and how the importance of language is inextricably underlined in it all, regardless of sexuality. But first of all, what does it mean to be queer? So in my eyes, I've already mentioned that I'm ace, but I'm also by, and so the former means that I just don't feel sexual attraction to anyone. We kind of all everyone felt this way until about secondary school, and it doesn't help that I had a twin brother who was, like, my polar opposite. And so asexuality allowed me to reclaim what relationships meant for us, so that just meant, you know, really emphasizing the importance of platonic and romantic relationships. And so in light of hookup culture, you may ask, what does this mean? So being ace just means you just have to work around things in your own little way, because believe it or not, asexual people can have sex too. But we don't owe anyone the attraction that we just won't give. But it's not all doom and gloom, because this is where consent and language are vital. If anything, we age people are just receptive to a warmth that we feel amongst others, and that's not, that's inherently just not sexual. Call it a yes to fight sleepover if you must. And while asex, and while sexuality is, so while sexuality is spectrum, being asexual just means that we lean more closely to one side of it. We also make up 1% of the population, and so sometimes being gays can feel only. Sex and sexuality are two very different things, but what they both share is this variety of passion. The beauty of the spectrum is that they all fluctuate, and you never have to feel tied to identify as one way if you don't fancy it. But when you do, you can be as comfortable in it as possible. Just do what makes you feel right. or who makes you feel right. Anyways, another lens to appreciate is understanding how hookup culture is presented in media. For queer people like myself, the likes of heartbreak high, heart stopper and sex education dramatize our realities. We end up becoming the media we consume, and so let's empower and educate ourselves and each other from it. If anything, it's a necessity, because hookup culture is already branded as something either worthy of gossip or extremely taboo by others. and when bombarded and grown up under this mindset, it's just a very long day. Another point to mention is the significance of language in these very intimate situations. And now I hope I don't speak for myself when I say that some of my most intimate moments have been with people that I just haven't spoken to ever again. We think it's this sense of loneliness that we just crave fulfillment for. You have nothing to lose when there are no strings attached, right? And so the role of language is bifold in its intent here, as I hope to outline both the impact of verbal and body language, two key components in the equation that is hookup culture. And so with that in mind, I remember a scene from sex education. So suppose you're in Wales, you're in Mordell High School, and you're stuck in a dreadful sex ed class. You're female presenting, and so you're getting absolutely slated for embracing the art of having sex, or even just merely discussing it. This scene in particular spots a lot of the anxiety that I felt with the impending doom of both Christian guilt and misconduct. misogynistic shame looming over me like a thunder cloud waiting to rain on me. However, this was instantly remedied when Maeve Wiley, essentially, rebelled. She said something that really, really stuck to us, and all it took was three words. Sex is beautiful. And since then, it kind of struck her nerve that I never really forgot about. She then went on to how it could be creative and funny, and I suddenly felt afforded of all these realities that everyone else around me had just seemed to challenge. and as a modern linguists, I'm a French student myself, having safe words in other languages sounds really nerdy, but it's actually really funny. And so long as both parties are safe, secure, and trusting in each other, hookup culture remains all around us, and I just refuse to be prepared to allow it to be bashed like the generations before us have done. We also then went on to remember the scene that shared with Isaac, who is in a wheelchair. The intimacy that was shared on our screens was quite literally something I've never seen before. Similar to queer relationships, interabled relationships, i.e., a relationship where one partner is disabled, are more than deserving of gratitude and representation. I do speak for myself because more my parents are an inter-abled relationship, and they are just the happiest they could ever be. Anyways, satisfaction is as simple as a sense of touch, and that is a beauty in itself. Additionally, hookup culture is empowering in the sense that it quite physically just brings two bodies together, whether it be your sneaky link in college to a one-night stand after park end. Casual sex can enable you to learn more about yourself under boundaries that you instill should you engage in it. Inherently, we are all just social creatures and sometimes it just boils down to wanting to be held. And so my final argument isn't really an argument. It's a poem because who is Bow without a poem? It's actually true. Anyway, Reclaiming is a piece that I wrote about someone who kind of made me feel a bit rubbish but then I knew better and then secured better, and now they're my ex. But anyways, the bottom line is that it embraces the beauty that is hookup culture and the euphoria of consent. And it kind of goes a little bit like this. Slightly sick and tired, sick and tired by being haunted by your entitlement, sick of being used, abused, thrown down into a shoot. I'm not a commodity, and fuck, I'm certainly not yours. And when I think about you or you, you made sex for wrong, and just sinful. But navigating myself in my own terms, I want to take the lead for once. Together we could form warm ripples in our bodies, human maps we lead and follow each other. And so why not bathe me like I'm baptize? Cleanse me off the trauma that cripples me. Remind me of the hope that I'm deserving of, the healing I'm entitled to. Actually sick, the thought spiral in my mind. Actually sick, because I'm chronically ill, but not that I have to be, not with you. And so as you walk out those doors tonight, vote no. Vote for positivity and vote for liberation. In doing so, we will continue to advocate the fact that hookup culture is refreshing, fun, and nothing to ever be ashamed of. Thank you very much.
