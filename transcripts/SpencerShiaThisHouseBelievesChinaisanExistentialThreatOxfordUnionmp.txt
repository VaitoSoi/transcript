 Thank you, Mr. President, for what is truly an honor and a debate a motion that is so important to so many of us. Before I begin my speech, let me delimit something and make something crystal clear. When this motion uses the word China, it does not not mean 1.4 billion citizens of the PRC. It does not mean all persons of ethnic Chinese assent, like myself or the treasurer, librarian, excuse me, university college. But what it does mean is that terrible communist regime, that government, which is a threat to our freedom, our liberty, and indeed our way of life. my speech has three points. First, the CCP is exporting authoritarianism to the third world. Second, the CCP threatens freedom here in the West and the first world. And third, how the CCP's mismanagement of COVID-19 was not a circumstantial fault or something that happened because of one person, but something owing to the basic structure of the Chinese communist regime. Then it falls upon me to introduce members of the opposition bench. First you will hear from Sharon Chow University College and you're a librarian. I stand corrected. While her position may have a veneer of democracy, her political record does not. After losing her election to the standing committee, she was given a litany of appointed positions by favorable presidents before being automatically promoted to a librarian after an auto-resignation. the rinks like an imperial Chinese bureaucrat in the days of yore, I can scarcely wonder why she supports the Chinese Communist Party. Second, we will hear from the ex-selected member of Standing Committee, Christchurch, Ms. Cindy Yu, an assistant editor at The Spectator. Of course, as a conservative, a reactionary, as some of you may call me, I am reticent to roast anyone who writes for a magazine as sound as a the spectator. But then I realized something. She shared a stage with Jackie Smith, the former Home Secretary on Good Morning Britain. And of course, Ms. Smith was involved in some sort of expenses scandal using taxpayer money to pay her sister. Now I totally understand why Ms. You would associate itself with a bunch of kleptocratic apparatchiks. Finally, we hear from Mark Logan, conservative member of Parliament for Bolton Northeast. At previous life, he was a member of His Majesty's diplomatic service and was posted to the PRC. A patriotic man, I believe, and a conservative, I was surprised that Mr. Logan is on the other side. But then I realized something. Mr. Logan has been educated at socialist and Marxist institutions' entire life. First came the LSC, founded by a bunch of Fabian thugs. Then came the People's Republic of Wadham College, a center for cultural Marxism. Now I understand why supporting the communists. And Mr. President, these are your speakers, and they're most welcome. Now, of course, as someone who loves definitions and words and intents sculli is textualism, it falls upon me to define what way of life an existential threat actually means. Way of life. Well, we must first understand way of life in the context of this House. This House is the Oxford Union. God willing, will be voting on those doors for and against this motion. Democracy is a way of life. Free speech. This term especially, thanks to the great leadership of the President, we've held motions that challenged the most controversial issues here today. Free speech is a way of life. This union has many ROs, a legal system, due process is a way of life. Freedom, democracy, due process. that is their way of life. Now, of course, this emotion does not say threat, but existential threat. So what does the word existential mean? And I think the way to define this, operationalize that word, is it will diminish or change the phenomenon modified to the point at which it is unrecognizable from its current state, which means they either get rid of freedom of democracy or they fundamentally change it so much that it's unrecognizable from what we understand in the status quo. Now, let me first begin with my first point, that they are exporting authoritarianism abroad in the third world. But before I get into the substance of my point, I must define what does the Chinese Communist Party want. Well, like all governments, they want wealth and power. I think this is a general rule across most governments. But I don't think it's as simple as wealth or power in the abstract. Like every other government, it is colored by ideology. In the case of the CCP's ideology and narrative, they had a century of humiliations. the opium of wars in the 1840s till Mautze Deng's takeover in 1949. But with the communist takeover, according to those Reds in John Anheye, what they're saying is there will be a century of rejuvenation, where China will recover its past position as a major economic and political world power. First a regional hegemon, then a global hegemon. That is their goal. So they're not pursuing any form of wealth and power, but a particularized form based upon ideology, at least to some extent, where China is a world power and a hegemon. This looks at control over trade routes and investment across Africa and Eurasia. It looks like political power over countries previously reliant upon the U.S. security guarantor. Now, how are they exporting authoritarianism to the point in which democracy is under threat on an existential level? Let's first look at the immediate region. Let's look at Hong Kong, for example, where they passed the national security law, not with any consent of the people of Hong Kong, but through decree from Beijing how many thousands of miles away. And under that law, they've been disappearing members of the press and bookshop owners. They have been arresting protesters and detaining them without due process. Indeed, they are increasingly making Hong Kong a previously democratic place, a place increasingly under the jack boot of authority. And this is inherent the CCP's ideology, because what do they want but reverse all the changes of colonialism and what is Hong Kong but a vestige of the opium wars and a terrible century of humiliation? Or let's look at Taiwan. Now, I know opinions will refer about the possibility of an invasion. But the fact that the CCP has increased the military spending recently raising their budget by hundreds of billions of dollars. That means they are increasingly. increasingly having the ability to invade Taiwan. Taiwan was under an authoritarian regime in the past, but increasingly, if they're invaded, their democracy will no longer exist. That is the definition of an existential threat. Let's look at the third world now. So China has done a Belt and Road initiative. I think it's overblown because we've seen funding actually decrease. But its foreign policy is generally of building economic and political reliance upon Beijing. Look at debt traps, for example, that China is giving out massive amounts of loans of third world countries that couldn't possibly pay back. Country like Sri Lanka, Burma, Djibouti. And what is the consequence of that? Often when they can't pay back the loans, China will do two things. Number one, make them increasingly reliant about Chinese trade. It looks like them, for example, being forced to resolve trade and investment disputes within Chinese arbitral courts that systematically benefit Chinese investors. What this looks like are them building new ports in areas like when they shield a Chinese. Chinese Navy, giving them leverage over international trade those vessels that support this diverse and global economy. Now, why does this threaten freedom and democracy? The mechanism for this is very simple, is that if you want to maintain the status quo of political and economic reliance upon China, then what you need is for those regimes to not change. Because if there's democracy, if there's free speech, there's always a possibility that the current arrangement gets voted out. And for that reason, what they must do is make sure that the people don't vote to reject it. And the CCP has been doing this to many of their new tributaries, countries like Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Kazakhstan, and Ecuador. What they're doing is exporting their new surveillance state, sending their technologies not only to spy upon 1.4 billion helpless Chinese people, but for that to be exported to these new authoritarian regimes to suppress new movements for democracy. Last year and the year before, the people of Kazakhstan wanted, more freedom. They protested initially because of a labor dispute, which became more political over time. But there, they were randomly imprisoned and detained indefinitely with no due process. Their speech was limited because of Chinese surveillance. With the Zimbabwean people want to get rid of their thugish regime of beastly, terrible thugs that don't know anything. Again, they were reliant. The Zimbabwean government suppressed any sort of dissent using Chinese technology. Increasingly, authoritarian regimes are being propped up, and democracy is being siphled, being removed. That's existential again. That's a key word, because of Chinese technology and the CCP's policy for world domination. Now let's move to the first world. I think the basic point is that China's activities in the West, through diplomacy, intelligence, and funding, threaten free speech as we know it. Now let's first look at what happens with Chinese dissidents. Under the Trump administration, one of the great things they did was called the China Initiative, using the DOJ to prosecute Chinese spies that are taking over American civil society. And what they found were two things. Number one, that CCP intelligence would infiltrate dissident networks to sabotage them. But even worse, they would often threaten dissidents to harm family relatives back home in China, chilling their speech. And this is also happening and affecting us directly here on university campuses, where CCP student organizations, like the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, funded by the CCP and supported by the embassies, and also the CCP affiliate organizations themselves through funding, are making these universities quash and chill speech that students want to engage. Last year, students protested the Winter Olympics at George Washington University. What happened was the university sought to crack down on these activities following protest by the CSS, the Chinese Students and Scholar Association funded by the CCP. As a result, because of administrative action, they are chilling their speech of students so and so far as they're increasing the costs of them speaking. That is a threat to their way of life, their way of engaging in free speech. Sure, not government enforced, but effectively with an institution as powerful as a multi-billion dollar university like GW, that is in function, in reality, chilling free speech. Or let's look at the University of Queensland. Take a couple of minutes, last paper speech, Matthew. saw the University of Queensland when they suspended Drew Pavlo for protesting against the CCP. I've met Drew Pavlo. We spoke here back in Mickleman. He's a great guy, greatest guy. You'll see this on Twitter one day. But more importantly, the fact is that as the University of Queensland suspended Drew Pavlo, they were taking millions from the Chinese Communist Party, funding from Beijing. That is chilling student speech. That is preventing them from engaging in their ability to exercise free speech by controlling institutions. And indeed, that must stop. And that is a threat that is existential. My final point now, I'll be gone soon. COVID-19. Now, what's the cause of this? Well, I personally think it's the lab leak. Now, it indulge me for a second. So not only does Chris Ray, the director of the FBI, think so, but even if you don't buy U.S. Intelligence Services, that Wuhan Institute of Irology was being funded by EcoHealth Alliance to insert fewer and cleavage sites into naturally occurring back coronaviruses. By inserting more fewer and cleavage sites, they become attached to human cells a lot easier. That is simple evidence that there was already research going on to make coronaviruses more attachable to human beings. But even if you don't believe that, even if you don't believe that the origin was a lab leak, We know there was a cover-up, and the cover-up is because of the structure of the CCP. We see this because, for example, when Li Wen Liang, who said there was a virus, who said there was a pandemic, when he said that, he was reprimanded, they died on a ventilator. We know this because the CCP made unusually quick advancements in the COVID vaccine, so much showed that multiple genealogists have said it's very likely that they actually found the sequence of COVID-19 back in November 2019, months before, most of us knew what COVID-19 was. That is evidence of a cover-up. Now, why is this a structural cover-up, not because of any particular person messing up because of the system? And the reason for that is because the source of power or legitimacy for a lower-level Chinese official is not through democracy, but appeasing your higher-ups, which means you do not want to report things to screw you over. Lee Kuchang, who is the outgoing premier of China, has something called the Kuchang Index. Which means that instead of looking at reported GDP figures that are almost always fake news. He must instead rely upon freight figures of finding the data. This is evidence that there is simply a lack of upwards accountability in China. And that proves the CCP covered up COVID and made the pandemic worse. And what did COVID do to us but threaten our way of life? We couldn't go out. We couldn't see our friends. Mental health issue incidents skyrocketed. And governments reacted through authoritarian measures, instituting that mask mandates, vaccine mandates, and lockdowns, not by passing any law, by the way, by creatively reinterpreting broad statutes, effectively abrogating the responsibility of the legislature and letting the executive make law. That is a fundamental threat to democracy. You might say the onus is not on the CCP to do what Western governments do. Two responses. Number one, the World Health Organization, funded by the CCP, recommended these measures. But number two, insofar as they made it worse, it only allowed the governments of the West to engage in rabid authoritarianism. And that authoritarianism threatened our economic life, but also democracy by allowing executive branches to make laws rather than our legislative branch, these kind of wholesale delegations that completely ruined the point of the separation of powers. So I want to end with some words in Chinese from the communist anthem. Li, will you and so on leader, arise you who wish not to be slaves. And that's what I wish for the people of the People's Republic of China. Thank you.
