 Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate the introduction and I appreciate being here today with all of you. I know you're busy with with exams. with exams and elections coming up. If I can give you some advice on elections, let me know. I can tell you certainly what not to do. But this is an exciting time for you all for a lot of reasons. The Jubilee. We drove over from London today, watched a lot of them on television and actually saw some of it. So I know you're very proud of this. this celebration and you should be. I was able to meet a few students, a few of them from the United States and we're proud to have students here from the United States because of the reputation of this institution and how important it is for certainly the UK but for countries all over the world including the United States who have had the opportunity to send students here. So thank you. for continuing that tradition. I'm looking forward to questions and whatever you all want to talk about. I'll be glad to respond to it. But before I sit down and we see what's on your minds, I just want to make one comment. I was in London yesterday where I was speaking at the George Marshall Foundation. It's the 75th anniversary of the George Marshall Foundation. Marshall Foundation. And there were many Marshall scholars were there and famous Marshall scholars from all over the world. But we in the United States are particularly proud, first of all, of George Marshall and what he did for the world in close collaboration with Winston Churchill and all the leaders in the UK during World War II. We're just as proud of him for what he did as Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and particularly what he brought forth in his Harvard speech, which laid out the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. That was really the foundation of post-World War II World Order. And the comment I want to make is that after more than 70 years of a rules, based world order that has secured this world pretty well. Problems, issues, still a lot of them. But we've not had a World War III. We take that for granted maybe those of us who were born right after World War II or certainly after World War II. We take that for granted, I think, sometimes, dangerously so. There's not been a nuclear exchange. Every World War II leader went to their graves, very concerned about a nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and the United States. And they all went to their graves worried about a World War III. But these coalitions of common interests that we built in the 10 years after World War II, the United Nations, IMF, World Bank, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is now the WTO, dozens of multilateral development institutions, they have served the world well. Selective security, NATO, and other institutions. They haven't prevented a lot of problems. They haven't solved all the problems. But when we analyze this and we inventory the last 70 years, We've had a pretty good run in the world. Not all countries, not all people, a lot of problems. And today we know and we are dealing with and going to be dealing with in the future more significant problems that we didn't face 70 years ago. Climate, energy, famine, terrorism, hopelessness, So what we are living through, and you all are going to be very primary in the future of the next generation and the world's future. Where does the world go as we are in the process of at the beginning of building a new world order? World order don't last forever. Things change. dynamics change, geopolitical situations change, economic situations changed. And when you think of what's happened in the world the last 70 years, technology, science, so much, we are now faced with building a new world order. I hope that we can continue to build that world order on common interests, and that was the fundamental element of the world order that we built. all people's interests, not just the United States or the UK or Europe or any particular country, but common interest, more freedom, more opportunities, more hope for mankind, more peace, less conflict. These are pretty basic, yet you build off of those, and that requires assuring that we have the energy, the clean air, the food, education that almost 8 billion people in the world today are going to require. And that just doesn't happen. That just doesn't happen because, well, it's always happened, hasn't it? No. So that's the thought I wanted to leave you with. I know we'll get into other things too. But I think that's probably overall the greatest, not just threat, but opportunity, that your generation is going to face. The challenges you're going to face in many ways are bigger and more significant than my challenges. But at the same time, you have more capacity, you have more capability to deal with those challenges. That's the story of history. Each successive generation has had more opportunities, more ability to deal with their challenges. And I think if we keep that in mind, and we do what you're doing and the people here and the people at universities and colleges all over the world not only to educate yourself and educate yourself in a wide way not just yes it's important if you want to be a doctor or whatever it is you have to have that but a responsible citizen as well learn something about the world you don't need to be an expert on any of it but be a aware of it and contribute. And I think the real issue and real objective and priority and purpose of education is to make a better world. Yes, you want to do it for yourself and your family, but don't lose sight of making a better world. That's the essence of what you're about, this institution, and the millions of students all over the the world and thousands and thousands of great institutions. So I wanted to leave you with that message and we'll get to whatever you want to talk about. Thank you. Appreciate being here. Thank you. Thank you very much, Secretary Hegel for those opening remarks. So very interesting. I suppose I would like to start my questions about an incident of US foreign policy that I think will be looked back on for decades as a sort of turning point, I suppose, which is the withdrawal from Afghanistan last summer. Do you think the right decision was made by the Biden administration to withdraw from Afghanistan? I do. We have been in Afghanistan for 20 years. we've essentially occupied and completely economically in every way propped up Afghanistan. We made some fundamental mistakes. We lost, in my opinion, we lost track of why we were there. And I remember when I was in the Senate on the Foreign Relations Committee during hearings, we would ask senior members of the administration, well, where are we going? How long will we be there? Is this nation building? What's the purpose? We know what the original purpose was, which allies like the UK went with us on it. But then we lost focus. We lost focus first when we made the disastrous, in my opinion, disastrous decision to invade Iraq. And we're still in Iraq. When that happened, we took our focus all. of Afghanistan. We pulled thousands of troops that we had in Afghanistan, resources out. And it became the secondary war. Iraq was the priority war. And that was where the first mistake was made. And then we just kept drifting and drifting and drifting. And mistake by mistake, here after year, for example, we never did a good job of the United States and all of our allies there, including the UK, of really training the Afghan military. For example, we never trained them to maintain the planes and the helicopters and the equipment that we sent. It wasn't that we didn't spend enough money. I mean, we spent a couple trillion dollars, the United States did there. But, but We kept for 20 years the Afghan people dependent on us. And you eventually are seen by the people of a country that you essentially are occupying as occupiers. Because you've lost your way, you've lost why you first went there. I was Secretary of Defense when we ended our combat role in 2014 in Afghanistan. Afghanistan. We pulled out thousands and thousands of troops out of Afghanistan, closed bases, but we still kept with NATO with us in other non-NATO countries, we still had 15,000 troops there. Well, by now things had started deteriorate in Afghanistan, and people turned against the United States, against the allies. And we just kept kind of hanging in. We continued to economically prop up the country and the governments. The government was considered of Afghanistan over the years by the United Nations as one of the five most corrupt governments in the world. But what we did, we kept supporting it without trying to fix it, but then it was too late. Fundamentally, the United States made a major mistake, as we have in Vietnam and I was in that war, as we did for other reasons in Iraq. We get ourselves into a mess because we don't ever stop and take a look at the culture of a country, the realities of a country, the religions, the tribalism, and every country's different. and every country is not a little UK or a little United States. And that's a fundamental problem for the United States that we've had since World War II. And we get ourselves in a lot of trouble when we do that. Now, I supported President Biden's decision to come out, but the terrible way that we did, did it was unforgivable. We did not put any time into planning. We didn't put time into thinking through how long it's going to take, what it's going to take, resources. Thousands and thousands of people needed to be hired by the United States State Department to process people getting out. You can't just, when you're in a country and occupying, supporting a country for 20 years, just leave without consequences. It was not going to be a happy ending no matter what. But you just can't pull out because you will see what we did see in Afghanistan. We should have never shut down Boggham Air Base and pulled military out of that. I mean, so many fundamental mistakes, I think, just because we didn't pay attention. So it's a long answer to your question, but I think I needed to at least put some of those pieces in as to why, in my opinion, so much of what we did in 20 years was a failure, not because the Afghan people, because we didn't do some things, some basic things right, and the way we left was wrong. And I just add this last point. I don't know how many of you have ever read the book, The Great Game, but it's because it's all about the UK in Afghanistan. By Peter Hopkirk. Yes. Yes. Yes, that's a book. And it's an excellent book because it gives the history of Afghanistan. No government, central government in Afghanistan has ever been able to govern Afghanistan. And if any of you have been there, you know why. The culture, everything about Afghanistan is different. It doesn't mean it someday it won't, but we didn't pay attention to any of those things. That's my answer. This time last year, the Afghan National Army was several hundred thousand strong, which is, for context, several times larger than the entire British Army. As you said, it had trillions of US dollars poured into it by the United States, hundreds of millions of pounds poured into it by the UK and the NATO allies. Where did that money, where did that strength go within two months? Well, as I just mentioned, the UN listed the Afghan government for many years as one of the most corrupt in the world. And so where that money went, it went into the pockets of many of the corrupt leaders. Many of the military funds destined for the military was siphoned off. I mean, you heard stories over the last couple of years how a lot of the Afghan soldiers were not paid, or two and three, even the, much as five or six months, they didn't get any pay. The stealing and the bribery was just rampant everywhere. I mean, that's how people survived because that money was being siphoned off and used for some of the corrupt leaders in Afghanistan. And it's a terrible story. History will record this story very specifically as to how the people Afghanistan, and it's always the people who are the ones that suffer, the ones who get hurt. Speaking of those people, more than half the population of Afghanistan was born after the NATO invasion of Afghanistan or intervention in Afghanistan. Those people are now ruled by a Taliban government that it doesn't look as likely to be displaced anytime soon. Do you think the West should now normalize relations with that government and attempt to moderate it? Or do you think that our interaction with that part of Central Asia is done for the next few decades? Washed our hands of it. Well, I think our interaction with that part of the world, I don't believe, is done. I mean, I don't think you can just walk away from a certain part of the world. But I think our interaction with Afghanistan and other parts of the world, in particular that part of the world, has got to be recalibrated, restructured, managed differently. I think finding ways, as I mentioned in some of my comments about common interest. The reality in Afghanistan is just as you said. I think it's unlikely that there will be any change in Afghanistan's government for the near future. I don't see how that would happen because of the stride and see the brutality of the Taliban government and what they're doing to young women, not allowing to go past certain grades in school, head coverings. They're going back to a lot of where they were 25 years ago. To your question about should we formalize relations, there's hardly any countries in the world that have formed normalized relations with Afghanistan. Yeah, as you know. I think you always have to weigh that question with the people, Afghanistan, the citizens. Would we help them if we did that? Maybe some. Would we help them more if we continue on the outside? Because as you know, we, you know, we, you know, United States particularly, but some of the Western countries hold a lot of Afghan assets, resources, and that we've frozen those assets and won't allow them until we formalize relations. Again, is that better because of does it force the Taliban government to moderate or does it make any difference? If you unfreeze those, assets and allow them to flow back to the government, does that help the people or will the people not see that? So I mean it's a tough thing. I think the position that we have right now is the correct one, approach to Afghanistan, trying to do what we can to moderate, to get moderation. And if the world sticks together on that, I think that's the most hopeful sign and best possibility for the future of Afghanistan. Lots of observers and academics viewed the vacuum from Afghanistan and have seen it as a further step in a decade of Western military withdrawal from across the world and military presence from strategic regions. And the sites of some of the world's most advanced militaries stumbling over themselves, get onto airplanes, sent a message across the world about the demise of Western dominance. Do you think that there is an indirect link between the withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's invasion of Ukraine earlier this year? No, I don't. I mean, I think there are indirect dynamics that may have played into Mr. Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. But I don't think the Afghanistan thing did. If you kind of unwind that a little bit, Mr. Putin, first of all, you've got to understand, as you all know, because you study this, you've got to understand something about not only the culture and the history of a nation, like I said, which we didn't do, and many of the wars we've gotten into since World War II, but the leader. and the leaders and the system. And when you start to unpack Mr. Putin's background and who he is, where he came from, what dominates his thinking, he is a KGB officer. He was very good at it. He is a pure KGB officer in that he was shaped and formed in every way by the KGB tactics and what they do. disinformation, misinformation, misinformation, deceit, deception, lies. I mean, he tells the Russian people and anybody who will listen and he broadcast it around the world that the reason that Russia went in to Ukraine was because Nazis have taken over Ukraine. Well, that's an insane statement. But that's what they do and that's what he does. I think he has always believed and I think a lot of Russians do, that Ukraine is just a natural part of Russia. And when the Soviet Union imploded and they lost many of their Soviet Socialist republics, all of those South Asian countries, middle, Asian countries, as well as Ukraine, that was wrong. And Putin has said that. If you recall, he said that that was the worst event of the 20th century, what happened to the Soviet Union. And if you know any Russian history, you know that the beginning of the wasn't called Russian then, Russo. Empire started in Kiev. That's where it started. It didn't start in Moscow or St. Petersburg or anywhere else. It was Keeve. So for the last 500 years, it has been a part, the breadbasket of the Soviet Union, Russia. And so there's a lot of historical information and factors that go. into that but Putin has always had his eye on Ukraine he's always believed it was a problem until he got Russia was able to get Ukraine back because that was a part of Russia the other part of this is too he has always been uneasy with NATO on the border especially many of those former behind iron curtain Eastern European countries going into NATO and the European Union. And of course, when you go back to 1991 in the agreement between the West and Russia over Ukraine, it talked about Ukraine's independence and the guarantee of its security that Russia would be part of that west, but when Ukraine started moving in the direction of we want to apply to become a member of NATO and a member of the EU, but especially NATO. I mean, that was a blinking red light, I think, for Putin. It probably would have been a number of years before Ukraine would have been admitted to NATO or the EU if then, because there's pretty rigid requirements and standards before you can join NATO. We were probably, NATO was probably a little lax in the late 90s when we brought a number of those Eastern European countries in. But I think all of that has told Putin, I cannot let this stand. Last point I would make on this, I think, and it cuts to your point, your question. I think he has watched the United States to your point. point over the years appear to be pulling back and I think the one issue that probably gave him more justification to think that was when I was Secretary Defense it was in 2013 when President Obama had said about Syria and Assad If he uses chemical weapons on his people, that will be the United States red line as to our involvement in Syria. Up to that point, we had not, we, the United States had not been involved in Syria. But when Assad used chemical weapons, and we had proof he did through the United Nations, then we, the national security staff of President Obama, gave, but especially my operation, Department of Defense, gave him options, military options, as to what then he could do to fulfill that promise, the red line that the world had heard. And he chose one, and it was one that we recommended, I recommended. But at the last minute, he pulled it down. And when Russia, Putin saw that the United States was not going to fulfill or honor what the president had said about the red line. I think that sent Putin a signal that the United States is not going to get involved in Syria, not going to get involved anymore in the Middle East. We're going to start coming out of the Middle East, not getting more involved. To your point, I think all that did add up to. If you can say, what was the plan? Well, that's top secret. And I, but I can tell you, that this, it was a plan that was not focused on a lot of loss of life for Syrian troops. It was a plan not built to cause a lot of loss of life. Boots on the ground? I'm sorry? Boots on the ground? No. No. But you know, we do have, today, we have special forces in Syria, and we eventually, because of ISIS and so on, and so on, it helped with that, but no. And you think President Obama made the wrong call on that? And you think President Obama made the wrong call on that? I do, not doing what he said he would do. I think it hurt America's reputation. I think it shook our allies and our partners. When a president of the United States says something to the world, I mean, that's a big deal. And not fulfill what you are. say you're going to do, especially in light of the atrocities that Assad was committing on his own people. I think there was a lot of question why I know there was. I was told that directly by every time I went to a NATO conference by my colleagues from other countries and when I'd meet with leaders of countries and so on. So I mean it wasn't an overwhelming mistake, but it was a mistake. And I think it did affect how Putin saw us. There were substantial discussions at the time, and I remember this, I was only 11 or 12, about the United Kingdom in France, putting boots on the ground in Syria. Do you think it was a mistake for other NATO allies not to intervene directly in Syria? I can't speak for any other country, but the history is, The history, again, just understand history. The colonial powers of which UK was one, France was one, Germany, Italy, that history is so bad and so blatant. And even today, Italians, Middle East, Africa, remember those days. their young people read history and their grandparents tell them about it and so on and so on. And so I think that's always a consideration for one of the former colonial powers to be concerned about that. If we put troops back in Syria, I mean, it was the French and the British that carved up the Middle East in 1923, the Sykes-Pico Act. It was now we could look back on it was a mindless Act. I mean, it carved up nations that had no consistency. It carved up nations that went across tribal boundaries, and it just made no sense. And I think all the colonial powers are aware of that and have been aware of that, some of those mistakes that they made early on, especially in the Sykes-Pico Act in 1923. And so I think that inhibited and still does a lot of Western powers to get back in involved in something. We're focusing then on Ukraine. Obviously, over the last few months, we've gone from an overwhelming Russian force of 180,000 soldiers on the border being pushed out of substantial territorial gains that they made and now engaged in a very different sort of warfare from the plan that was originally put forwards by Russian high command. Why has Ukraine been so successful in its defense of its homeland? Well, I think, let's start with. the Russian side. Why have they so miserably failed? Let's start there. I think Putin made some very big, very costly, and I think not just costly now, but for the future. The consequences they're going to visit Russia for a long time. He underestimated the will of the will of the Ukrainian people, totally underestimated their will. He underestimated the competency of the Ukrainian army. In 2014, and I was Secretary of Defense then, when they took some of the eastern part of Ukraine, the Russians did, and then Crimea, we were limited as to what we, the United States could do, and NATO powers because the Ukrainian army was so bad. It hadn't been trained, and quite frankly, Ukrainian governments have been pretty corrupt since independence. And we couldn't give them the kind of weapons that we've been giving them in the West and UK and Germany and so on. I mean, couldn't even think about giving them those weapons because they didn't know how to use them. They would probably leave them on the battlefield. The Russians would get them. And the other thing, if we started doing that, we would make it worse for Ukrainians. And so we gave them other more defensive weapons. We supported them other ways. And what happened after that, we started training the Ukrainian army, not just the United States, the UK, a lot of NATO countries did. And so their army today is a whole different army than it was in 2014. So that's one thing, mistake Putin made. Another big mistake he made was the strength of the NATO coalition of 30 nations coming together. I think he totally underestimated not just the strength, but the cohesion of the West, in complete, absolute support of Ukraine. of Ukraine. And in some countries in Europe, as you know, at their own peril, Germany, Nord Stream Pipeline, so on. Third, he overestimated his own military. And I don't care what the country's difference in attitudes, difference in armaments, difference in capability. When you invade another country, a big country like Ukraine, almost 45 million people. That is a huge undertaking. And you put 150, 200,000 troops in another country. If you don't have a logistical train to support those, and their logistical train was non-existent, because he thought, Putin thought, this would be over in three days. He thought they would take Kiv in three days. They would put a puppet government in, and the whole thing would turn around. The Ukrainians would say, well, you know, we are part of Russia. And those things never happened, never, ever happened. And it got worse. And you saw so much of the world supporting Ukraine, not just NATO countries in the EU. And the reality that he did not understand, and he still doesn't, because he thinks Putin, And the Russians can overcome this, not in this world, and that is, Russia has no allies, that has no friends. Even China, who has abstained in the United Nations votes and so on, but they have not produced any support or help for Russia in armaments. Russia has asked the Chinese for help in armaments. is getting no help. It's getting no help. You get black market on your oil and so on and so on. But that's not the kind of world you want to live in in this world and it's going to get worse. So those are some of the big reasons I think what's happened. Were you expecting the cohesion of NATO and or do you think that this marks a turning point for the next few decades of NATO? I think it does mark a turning point. Number one, because what I was saying earlier, just because we've had 70 years of relative peace, except for the Balkans in Europe during the 90s, what's the problem? And when we saw Russia invade, blatantly invade and committed atrocities right under our nose right here in Europe, we said, how could that happen? This is the 21st century. century. That's sobered everybody up. And I think it's going to affect NATO for a long time. Was I surprised? Only Vladimir Putin could have done for NATO what he has done for NATO and bring a cohesion together. I mean, I think NATO and all the meetings I used to have in Brussels, I mean, there was not serious, but there's some fraying. fraying. I mean, Macron and France talked last two or three years about what we need is a European army. We'll stay in NATO, but we really need our own European army. Different conversations like that would not be good for NATO at all. And so I could see some fraying of NATO, but only, like I said, only Putin could have done what he did to bring NATO together. And it was It will be there for a while. Is NATO doing enough? I think NATO is doing enough. I mean, can you do more? Can you provide more armaments, I suppose? But the Ukraine army can only absorb so much. I mean, so you can, railroad cars full of armaments and plane loads of armaments, that's good. But if they just sit on a runway somewhere and the Ukrainians can't absorb it. because you've got to get all those armaments into and on the other side of Ukraine, which is a long way from their western border to their eastern border. And so it takes time. And the Russians are smart. They're focusing on railway lines and different transportation means to get those weapons around Ukraine where they need them. No, I do think NATO is doing enough. Germany has, that has surprised me a little bit. I mean, because they've hurt their own economy on cutting off oil and natural gas. UK is doing a tremendous amount. Not all NATO countries, but not all NATO countries have the capability. Some NATO countries are pretty small. France? I think France is doing enough. Let me put it that way. Could they do more? I think they could do more. But I think they're doing enough, but they could do more. I'm very actually, I want to move on to some audience questions, but very quickly I'll touch on China. Obviously, very recently, President Biden has reaffirmed the United States commitment to defend Taiwan in case of invasion by the People's Republic. of China. Do you think the United States actually would put boots on the ground to defend Taiwan? I don't know. I think it depends on a number of things, starting with who's the President of the United States. Each president, when you, and I've worked for three presidents, I've known every president since Johnson, when I was in the Senate, worked with some. I mean, I know Biden very, very well. He's a very good friend. Each president that I have talked to personally about China, Taiwan, is a little different amount of enthusiasm. And strategic ambiguity has been our official policy on this issue, strategic ambiguity. And I think that's where most of them have been most comfortable. One reason, don't tell, don't let the Chinese know, keep them guessing a little bit too, that no, we're not going to get involved or yes we are. So strategic ambiguity I think has been the right approach. If you're China and you're looking at the reality, I mean we have that. big bases in Asia. We have a number of troops in Asia, South Korea, Japan, Guam. I mean, we've got well over 100,000 troops. Then when you add our naval fleet and Air Force bases, I mean, we've got a major presence, by far bigger, bigger. much bigger in Asia than we have anywhere else. China's guy is aware of that. Taiwan would not be a cakewalk for China. They have a very good army and Air Force and Navy. They have modern equipment. This would be a tough affair, a very, and especially if you've got the United States helping, and we would help. I mean, what degree. I don't think there's a very, I don't think there's. the Japanese or the South Koreans would have any choice, but to help too. And they would. Boy, that's taken on a lot if you're trying to. That's taken on an awful lot. So I, like I said, I don't know. So it depends on the president. It depends on the Congress. It depends on our allies in Asia, where they would be. Would you support a permanent US military presence in Taiwan? No. I think what we have is right, not have a permanent military base there or presence. If we did that, that would really totally change the equation with China. Final question from me, I promise I will open it up. Under your tenure, Secretary of State of Defense, the United States was criticized quite a lot by allies in East Asia for scaling back some of its military commitments in the region. Do you think that this, or at least the perception that this has been the case, is partly to blame for the increased expansionism of the People's Republic of China in the region, the building of islands in the South China Sea, increased activity in Hong Kong, etc? I don't know. I've never heard that. In fact, that's not true. It's on the Wikipedia page. Well, that's just not true. We didn't scale back our military presence. We increased, certainly our naval. Like I said, our big bases are in Guam, Japan, South Korea, Okinawa. No, no, don't you remember when President Obama shifted a focus on the Asia pivot, the Pacific Asia. I mean, that's where, and we were criticized in Europe for that, because, We're abandoning Europe. We didn't abandon Europe at all. I mean, we've still kept the bases we've got. But that's just not true. We didn't scale back our military. We increased our military. On that, I did promise. So any questions in the audience, please raise your hands now. The gentleman at the end of the bench at the front. Right, I'm thank you so much for coming. I'm just going to ask your thoughts on a recent book that was published by Elbridge Colby, who was a Trump-era DOD staffer. So his view was that the Europeans should engage in stronger rearmament, and the U.S. should move the balance of their forces far more towards East Asia to contain the growth of China and prevent it from expanding the Western Pacific. What are your thoughts on that policy prescription? Well, first of all, we don't have a lot of troops. in NATO countries compared to Asia. You could only increase your troop levels anywhere depending on do you have the facilities? And first of all, does the country eat the host country? Are they agreeable? Do they want more U.S. troops? and platforms, whether it's ships or helicopters, planes. So there's all those dynamics go into it as well. I think, who wrote the book by the way, Trump? Oh, it's told me, who was the deities after? Yeah, I'd never heard of him, but I didn't, I'm not aware of the book. Another thing too, this is the 20th, This is the 21st century. And if you look at, pay attention to the most effective armaments being used in Ukraine today, they're not troops on the ground. And this is where the future is going, by the way. It's all technology. It's drones. It's all missiles. It's artificial intelligence. Yeah, you're going to need troops on the ground. But the most effective weapons are those that I just mentioned, and then byproducts of each of those, not troops on the ground. So I'm not sure what his thesis is, again, going back to your question about, I mean, we have tremendous capabilities in East Asia. I mean, we've got not just a big basis there, but we've got ports where our nuclear submarines can visit. And there's no particular ground presence there, but we've got Trident nuclear submarines that can do a lot more damage than 50,000 or 100,000 troops. So I'm a little mystified by that, the point in the book, because that's not where it's going. Because the lethality of weapons today are so massive, aside from nuclear, conventional, are so massive that they can eliminate. We're seeing a lot of it in Ukraine, but we're not seeing the most destructive weapons used yet. in Ukraine. So I don't agree with that thesis. The member who's very fast as hand in the white t-shirt third row on the left. It strikes me that the agents we're talking about here are essentially Soviet Russia gone gone wrong after 89 and China and there are similarities one could draw to the Cold War although it seems that the senior partner and the junior partner of swap places. The long game in the Cold War was to bankrupt the Soviet Union. If we are in a new Cold War, which you may disagree with, but if we're in the footholes of the New Cold War, what is our long game now? Is it about technology or is it about something broader than that? Well, it's about many things, but let's start with technology. I mean, we cannot afford to fall behind in technology because the game will be up. And China has made tremendous advances in every aspect of that. They've also been very productive in the area of technology and their platforms, meaning ships and planes and so on, because they have no legacy weapons to continue to support and maintain, like we do. I mean, we've got planes and ships. that are 50 years old. China, over the last 20 years, every dollar they put in to their military is forward. They don't maintain anything because they didn't have anything. And that's a huge issue for us, although our defense budget is larger than the next 10 defense budget, including Russia and China. So technology is one thing. Partners and allies. Huge. It's always been important, but it's more important and will be more important when you guys start making these decisions than ever before. China has no friends either, just like Russia. They have no friends. They have no allies. I mean, they're trying to make friends, as you know, in the South Pacific now, in the Solomon Islands, and so on and so on. But there is not one of those leaders in any of those areas that are not very wary of China. China doesn't give foreign aid. I mean, the United States gives massive foreign aid, billions and billions and billions. And we have been since World War II. Now, you can't buy friends, but you can support friends. Give you an example, China, when I used to get to Africa when I was in the Senate, and wherever it was, and I'd land and the embassy would pick me up and we'd be driving along, and we'd always usually have the foreign minister or somebody greet me at the airport of whatever country. I'd be driving along into the city and to meet with their president or whoever. And I would see a new school or a new hospital or a new beautiful highway. And I'd say, this is beautiful. Who built this? And they would say, oh, the Chinese. Oh, very nice. But then kind of under their breath, they'd say, well, they wouldn't allow any of our workers to work on the project. They brought all their workers in. And not all of them would say this. Some of them, the ones were more honest and knew, some of them didn't know, that all the time that China was doing all these nice things for people and never having troops on the ground, never having any of their troops on the ground. They were locking up box site contracts for the next 50, 75 years or contracts on natural resources that nobody knew about. That they could go open minds and do things that what's happened now over the last 20 years, all these countries have gotten smart. Just one example. So I think partners and allies who have common interests that I talked about earlier are so much more important than anything other than technology because technology will rule I mean look at our society today social media I mean every facet I started cellular telephone companies in the early 80s when nobody knew what cellular was I mean it's wireless telephony is very simple and I mean everybody they thought it was some medical term or some cellular And I remember I started an international company and I went around the world to developing countries. And I thought if this technology, it's going to be great and it's going to transform as it has, everything in the world. And it still is. Because everything we have came off of the development of wireless telephony cellular. And that had been boxed up for years and years by AT&T because they were in the monopoly in the United States. United States. We had cellular. We were using cellular in World War II. But because AT&T controlled everything, they didn't want to roll it out because it would affect their profits with wireline telephones. So we don't want you guys to have this other stuff. Well, that changed that changed everything. And I saw how technology, I saw how fast cellular exploded. Because the developing countries I went to, I thought, you guys have no phones you have no technology in communications this leapfrogged you ahead of everybody generations but they never because I was on the first wave they never quite bought it because they thought it was some American deal and you know if it's so good why don't why don't you have it well first of all we didn't need it but it was just coming on so I often think of what happened and as a result And then 10 years later, I mean, developing countries, oh my God, yes, they were just taking it as fast as they could get it. But the basis of your question is a good question, because things are changing at such a rate. We can't calculate it. We can't keep up with it. The world can't. It's happening that fast. You guys have been born into that kind of. world and your generation has been. For you that's not as much as an adjustment. I've got a daughter and a son 28 and 30 and when they started going to school and so on, I mean you had all this technology. I mean not everything we've got today. But Facebook, I mean all these things, they just grew up with it. So what's what? such a big deal about all this. Well, when I grew up, when dinosaurs were on the earth, it was totally different. So the rate of change has produced so many more challenges. But the good news, again, is I don't think you see it that way, the same way. You see challenges, you see change. But the great news is for the world is that I think you're absorbing it better and faster and more naturally than my generation or those that came after me. And that's a tremendous advantage to have. Tremendous. So we'll see. I'm just about old enough to remember VCRs and cassette tapes. Not really, but about five or six, I remember them. Technically, between the end of the time, but I'll allow one or two more questions. I'll go to this side to the member in the front row. Might you be able to stay around the bar for 20 minutes afterwards to answer some questions? Yeah, I'll get, sure. Thank you very much. Hi. So I was just curious, as someone from Taiwan, what are your thoughts on the fact that US has been sending higher level delegations to Taiwan in the last several months for the first time in decades? And looking to sign a trade pact and essentially moving closer to Taiwan, is that actually have the count? counter effect of encouraging further Chinese military aggression and kind of going opposite to what you were saying of showing strategic ambiguity? Well, you never can be sure. As to your point about, is this showing the opposite effect what we may want to show? But I don't think so. I'm very supportive of the those delegations going to Taiwan. Because for years and years, and you know this, we've kind of left Taiwan alone. I mean, yeah, we, and I think it was, well, we don't wanna exercise China, and we're doing a lot of trade with them, that's the huge market, and so on and so on and so on. So we haven't paid much attention to Taiwan. But, and I meet with your, representative in Washington fairly often. And I always have. When I was in the Senate, I did too. But I think it's the right thing to do. Because it does send a clear message to China that if they would start something with the Chinese, and they may, they're going to have a problem. and it's not like it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago the U.S. attitude toward Taiwan or the Congress's attitude toward Taiwan. That's totally different today than what it was 10 years ago. And I think that's good. And I think the basis of all of that as much as anything else is, and this is all for your generation to be very aware of. history is full of examples where we have tried to appease dictators, authoritarian governments. Well, let's just, let's not get them all too upset. And maybe we can do this. I mean, the perfect example is Neville Chamberlain comes back from Munich in 1938. He waves a piece of paper, piece at our hand. and he was just a stooge for Hitler. And we all know what happened after that. It isn't just Chamberlain and it was all the West. But history is replete with all that. And I don't think we should, and I'm no warmonger. I was in war in 1968, and I saw a lot of bad things happen. In the year I was in Vietnam, we sent 16,000 dead Americans home. 16,000 in one year. America would never put up with that today. But no, I'm one of the, I'm not a peacenick, but strength through peace. I mean, that's what Ronald Reagan once said, and he's right on that. You can't buckle under because this world now is too dangerous for that. That's another reason why partners, allies, friends are so critical. So critical. So, I mean, I don't know. I'm not smart enough to know what China's thinking. Although I can tell you, in 2014, I took more, the two years I was Secretary of Defense, I took more trips to Asia Pacific than our Secretary of State did. And I was in China for a week and met with Xi, had three meetings with Xi, and on issues that he didn't want to talk about. in order to the Chinese government, about the East China Sea, South China Sea, and what they're doing. They're building up those little rocks in the runways, lying about it. And I told she, I said, that's not true. No, no, we're just doing this for shipping purposes. And that's not true. I said, you know we have intelligence that shows you're building runways, and airplane hangers for your most sophisticated jets. I mean, you're building up many fortresses all over East China, South China Sea that could affect the international shipping lanes. And we're not going to tolerate that. And I've been to China many, many times. I've not been to Taiwan, but I've been to China all over China, in China, matter of fact. And what's going on in China? too is I don't think simple. I think there's a lot going on there. And not all of it good for China as far as how she would interpret what's good for China. So I think there's some opportunities there too. But again, trade, relationships, exchange, because the economics of the world, as we move further into the 21st century with almost 8 billion people are going to become more and more critical. I'm afraid that's all we have time for in this section, but I believe Secretary Hagel's kindly offered to go to the bar afterwards, so if you'd like to grab a pint with him and ask your questions, then 15, 20 minutes or so to do that. Very quickly before we end, I'll ask you this one question that we ask all of our speakers in two or three sentences, if we don't have anything more than that. What advice would you give to the students at the University of Oxford? First, respect all people. Respect all people, listen to all people, and always do the right thing. It gets difficult. The older you get the bigger responsibilities and bigger jobs you take on. jobs you take on because you're going to be compromised. But don't compromise what you know is right. Always, always, always, always do the right thing. And it'll come back. You may suffer in the short term, but I've lived long enough and had enough jobs and done different things, made enough mistakes to know that's true. That's just not a proverb. It's true. It's true. no matter what, if you do the right thing. And then, like I said, in my opening remarks, always work toward making a better world for all people. Ladies and gentlemen, Secretary Chuck Hegel, thanks very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm
