 With that, I look to Chloe Glynn, guest liaison officer, to close the case for the proposition. chosen to speak here today. It is also my first time, especially having heard such compelling arguments, at least from the proposition. I have two points that I'd like to pick up from the opposition. Unfortunately, they're both from the professor. Sorry. Number one, you talk about Durkheim and the shared set of beliefs and what would happen, sorry, the shared set of beliefs that organise our life and I quote, cannot sustain life without this shared set of norms, eyes and beliefs. But what happens when we have multiple competing religions creating those set of beliefs and norms? Number two, you quoted Durkheim from 100 years ago, or 1912, which is more than 100 years ago. But yeah, I would like to ask people today, do you look to Durkheim who tried to answer this question without knowing how the world would look 100 years ago? Or do you look to the Dalai Lama, who recently published a book quite literally titled Moving Beyond Organised Religion. Now, before starting my points, I would just like to say that moving beyond organized religion can be interpreted in many ways. I will not look to war. It's overdone. Sorry, Lucas. From eradicating large places of worship, religious hierarchies, to moving beyond religion in society, by moving away from an era in which religious teachings determine our policies and laws. It is the latter that I will focus most on today due to the simple fact that this house sits in an increasingly secular society in which particularly one religion can no longer determine how we live as a society. Today I will make three main points. This proposition is not calling for a total ban or abolition of religion. Number two. The power organized religions hold is not fitting in an increasingly secular society. And finally, what is the need for organized religion? First, this question does not call for a ban on religion. It simply asks for a movement beyond organized religion to progress into the future. I argue that we must move with the times, follow the lead of secularisation into a new technological era in which religious doctrines, structures and ideology no longer govern our lives or influence wider government policy, culture or estate education. We are not here to argue that religion is no longer relevant or useful in an individual's life. As we have heard tonight, religion can have many benefits, and I firmly believe that individuals should maintain the right to believe and practice their faith. However, organized religions characterized by their large number of people, historic legacies, and establishment not only... No, thank you. not only result in power due to a number of people, but also financial power, which is allowed organised religions to maintain their prominence in politics and society. While organised religions, by definition, have a large number of people. Statistically today, in this house, the minority of you will identify as religious. For example, the British social attitudes figures from 2018 found that 52% of the UK said they did not belong to a religion. if less than half of the British population would consider themselves religious, then surely we must move beyond religion and the methods that govern our society in order to create policies that reflect the identity of individuals today. I move on to my second point. One of the issues we've organised religions is their significant economic leverage and political power despite being a minority opinion in the UK, which this house sits in. particularly when looking at just one religion rather than all religions. For example, as a woman, I look to organise religion such as Christianity, and the structures they have created that have dictated when, where and the logistics and how one can access an abortion. It is not hard to find these examples of women's rights being determined by religion in wider society, whether that be Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland, speaking out and trying to prevent the legalising of abortion in Ireland in 2019, to the 2021, Texas abortion bill, which was heavily supported by organised Christian groups, giving private citizens the right to sue abortion providers who carry out the procedure after a heartbeat has been detected around six weeks. I'm sure many of us here, especially the women, will know that six weeks is not long enough to know whether you are pregnant or not. This allows religious organisations to govern the lives and bodies of women who may not follow that religion. Although it could be argued that organized religion is itself becoming more liberal in contemporary society, the pace of change is insufficient, and these structures continue to govern the lives of many. Looking further afield, I come to Sharia law. Now, in most countries that follow Sharia law, the majority of the population do identify as Muslim. Therefore, the power organized religion has, in those countries, may be equal to the size of the population. However, what is hard to tell is whether those people who identify as Muslims would still do so if they did not live under the state of Sharia law. Furthermore, as previously stated, we must look to the future, moving from the past to progress as a society. This is where I look to you. To decide tonight whether it is still right for countries and societies to be governed by the interpretations of a book such as the Quran that is at least 1,600 years old. do not even get me started on the Bible, which is estimated to be 3,400 years old. No, thank you. When you vote tonight, I want you to think about the society you live in, the freedoms you have and the future you envision for people around the world. When it comes to walking through those doors, recognize as an individual that you still hold your own religious beliefs, and you can respect the religious beliefs of others. But as a house, as a body of people, we can decide to move beyond all. organized religion and the way it plays a role in everybody's lives despite them not believing. Finally, I ask you, what is the need for religion? The opposition has spoken on the great work and how it takes care of communities. I mean, essentially we could have a whole debate, a whole different debate on the work they do. I'll look to charity work just due to limited time. I cannot deny that this is commendable and life-changing for many. However, if we look to the past at charitable work, religious leaders and followers have carried out, we can now see that Christian missionaries in Latin America and Africa did not do charity work without seeing some benefits to their cause, as they also spread Christian and European ideology, which later caused conflict rather than peace. Today, the use of food banks, baby and parent groups should not be compared to acts of colonialism, but we must recognize that young children, homeless people, or struggling parents should not be targeted by organised religions who often hold motivations of encouraging people to join the religious organisation as well as helping their community. Help can be given as a primary and central motivation. Charities do not need religious affiliation. We can love and care for one another out of empathy, not because a religious leader told us to do so. To conclude, everyone is free to hold their own individual beliefs. In no way are we asking you to remove religion. But I am asking you today in this house where statistically the minority of you will identify as being religious, is it still right to live in a society in which religion can dictate the way people live? Consider the atrocities organized religions have caused in the past and the lack of regulation that continues to this day in this country. Consider the way religious texts are interpreted interpreted and taught, and whether an equal society that reflects your beliefs is possible if we do not move beyond religion. Organised religion, sorry. This proposition argues that we must move beyond organized religion to progress to a system of science, democracy and equality that reflects everyone in modern society and what you wish to see in the future. You may not be interested in organised religion, but organised religion is interested in you. Tonight, you have the power to choose how religion. and impacts your life. If you value anything from equality, democracy and technology, walk through the ice side. Thank you.
