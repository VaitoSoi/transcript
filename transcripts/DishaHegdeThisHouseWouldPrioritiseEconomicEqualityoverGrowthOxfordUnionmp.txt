 Thank you very much, Mr. President, for giving me the immense honour to speak in tonight's debate. After four terms on committee and many, many hours of my vacation spent putting our term cards together, this will be my first paper speech, so I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be here tonight. When I was sat in this chamber a year ago for the first time, I could never have imagined that I'd be be stood here before you today, running for president. I could also never have imagined that I'd be doing so with a broken arm, having asked the hospital if they could match my cast to the colour of my dress, which they kindly did. But I guess it's the first time for everything. Now, anyone who believes in indefinite growth in anything physical on a physically finite planet is either mad or an economist. I'm an economist myself. It's okay. Those words were said by bolding in the 1970s and ring even truer today in the face of rising inequality. Economic growth is an objective that we watch leader upon leader pursue mindlessly. Through the use of GDP, we constantly monitor its movements, we measure it to the decimal place, and we use it as a metric by which to judge the health of our economies and the success of our governments. However, as issues of inequality and climate change come into the centre stage, there is a bigger movement towards refocusing what our policy objectives should be. Nations such as Scotland, New Zealand and Bhutan have all made moves towards going beyond mindless GDP growth in their national accounts. I have three main points for you tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Firstly, prioritising economic growth above all else does more harm than good. It helps the super-rich get richer and the ordinary people to stay poor. Secondly, the prioritising economic equality is better for social advancement and lifting people out of poverty. I will cite the numbers and aim to show you that economic inequality actually harms growth. Thirdly, how given climate constraints it becomes even more important to shift our priorities to ensure that our children and grandchildren have an improved standard of living. But ultimately, to ensure that our children and grandchildren can actually have a life at all. Before I go further into my points, it is my duty and indeed my honour to introduce tonight's opposition speakers. First up, we have Chloe Glynn, a third year at St. Anne's College and the Union's Development Officer. She claims to be a woman in STEM, despite studying geography. Chloe has currently taken a year out of her degree, so one could say that just like trickle-down economics, Chloe Glynn does not work. Chloe is also the union's development officer, and the largest thing she's developed in this role is an addiction to the union bar. I can only imagine how much we, raised through Chloe's drinks expenditure. Second, on the side opposition, you will hear from Mr. Peter Bone, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough and Rushden. Now, Mr. Bone has clearly had a flourishing political career, having served as deputy leader of the House of Commons in 2022. However, Mr. Bone has not had the best relationship with the media. Having been described as Britain's meanest boss for his opposition to the minimum wage, and also is nepotistic for previously employing his wife as his executive secretary. Now, I think these qualities, being a mean boss, a nepotism, would make Mr. Bone a great fit amongst union presidents. Now, speaking third, we have Juan de Vila, a fourth-year engineering student at St. John's College, my own. Now, I must admit, when I found out that Juan was running for president from the same college as myself, I had the same reaction as probably most of you in this room. Who is that? Now, according to his Instagram, what of Juan's hobbies is pheasant shooting? And so it's probably unsurprising that Juan was previously president of the Oxford University Conservative Association and is speaking against economic equality tonight. Lastly, we have the pleasure to listen to the right honourable Lord Hannan, who is a live peer at the House of Lords, advisor to the UK Board of the UK Board of of trade and one of the founders of the Vote Leave campaign. Lord Hannan is the second ex-Alca president I have introduced tonight and given that Lord Hannan graduated from Oriel College, I suspect the quality of his speech will not be fantastic. Lord Hannan was an outspoken critic of lockdown during the pandemic, calling it a confiscation of liberty. If Lord Hannan thinks that COVID lockdown policy was a curtailing of human rights, I wonder what his reaction to the the Tories Rwanda policy will be. Mr. President, these are your speakers, and they are indeed most welcome. When considering this question before us today, we must consider ultimately what is our policy goal? Whether we prioritise economic equality or economic growth, what is it we are trying to achieve? I will take the stance tonight that ultimately our policy goal should be social welfare and improving the standard of living while looking after our planet. This brings me on to my first point. The prioritising economic growth, above all else, does more harm than it does good. 20th century economists assured us that if economic growth creates inequality, don't try and redistribute it, because more growth will benefit everyone, except it doesn't, and it won't. Let's not forget, we live in a society where 1% of the world's population own over half of the world's wealth. Our pursuit of GDP growth has widened the gap between the richest and the poorest, and it has benefited those that were already well off. Early this week, we were lucky enough to host Bernie Sanders here at the Union, so I thought I'd take the USA as an example. Since the 1980s, real GDP in the United States has grown by about 130%. But despite this, the bottom half of the American population have been completely shut off from this economic growth. Wages stagnated, life satisfaction flatlined, poverty grew, and the environment got worse. I've said it before, and I'll say it again, trickle-down economics does not work. It just doesn't. This idea that they say fair thinkers have worshipped that cutting taxes for the rich will create more jobs for the middle and lower classes, meaning that economic growth is felt by everyone, is just fundamentally flawed. Unfortunately, as it turns out, no thank you. No, thank you. Many, many governments in the past have. But unfortunately, as it turns out, those at the top do not use tax cuts to help the working classes. they use it to hoard their wealth and keep wages and working conditions lower. We see this time and time and again. Amazon and Jeff Bezos, aided by tax cuts, have enough money to pay their employees a fair wage and provide reasonable working conditions. However, Bezos will continue to increase his fortune through exploitation and underpayment of workers, and no one except executives at Amazon will actually benefit from this. Secondly, economic inequality hurts economic growth. OECD data has repeatedly proven that a lack of economic investment derived from inability and inaccessibility to financial wealth and education is a key factor to driving inequality in economies from around the world. Recent OEDC forecasting has placed the UK as the only developed economy, including Russia, to predict economic downturn in 2023, attributing a large part of this to be due to the weakening of the welfare state. In the UK, the number of households with children experiencing food poverty has nearly doubled in the past year, affecting almost 4 million children. The Food Foundation has found that 80% of British people support expanding the Free School Meals program to all children whose families are on universal credit. Pressure is mounting on the government to make this move amid rising household bills and increase poverty, and yet in pursuit of growth, growth, growth, we have left behind what is the future of our society. When certainly children are growing up in poverty and are going to school hungry, these children who become the future of our workforce and our economy cannot achieve their full potential. It is time to stop chasing endless GDP growth at the expense of our people and to put social welfare first. No, thank you, Spencer. In the face of environmental threats, we cannot keep striving to produce and to consume more and more goods. Our panace simply can't take it. It's not possible to have your cake and to eat it too. It is time to put people's welfare above mindless growth that does not trickle down. Vote for realism, vote for prioritizing ordinary people, and vote for the proposition tonight. Thank you. I'm
