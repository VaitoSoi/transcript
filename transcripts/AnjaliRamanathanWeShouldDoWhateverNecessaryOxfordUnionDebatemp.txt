 I now look to my secretary, Angela Ramanathan, to continue the case for the proposition. Thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to speak in tonight's debate, and thank you, Rachel, for the introduction. Before I get into my arguments about why I propose tonight's motion, I'd like to address the part of this motion that goes on set. We're here tonight to discuss whether a means is justified, but the motion, of course, does not specify the end that we're working towards. The proposition, therefore, reserves the right to decide which problems we do whatever necessary to solve and which we wouldn't. This means that in order to ever have a debate about whether we ought to do whatever necessary, we must first identify a problem that is severe, irreversible, and carries a sense of urgency. Only then is it justifiable to take all necessary measures. I'll now go on to make three points. The first is that violence isn't necessary, and therefore it isn't justified. Second, I will outline the necessary components of effective protest, that is, whatever is necessary. Finally, I'll show that the destruction of property, though it is often touted as an example of unacceptable protest, can be a highly effective way of demonstrating our values in a way that speaks the language of corporations. My first point this evening is that violence is not necessary. The opposition tonight will try to persuade you to oppose this motion on the basis that violence is not justifiable. I agree with them. Violence is unacceptable, and this is because there are some values which are fundamental to an organized, compassionate, and humane society. But it's also because violence is rarely the only option available as a mechanism for social change. Indeed, violence can set back efforts to bring about social and political change by harming the popular opinion of the movements responsible. This brings me to my second point, which is about what is, in fact, necessary. I'll illustrate my point first by describing ineffective protest. When social issues hit the mainstream, in recent times particularly, protest has become fashionable. It's become a Saturday morning activity, often followed by brunch and memorandes. Moses. And though communal spirit, don't get me wrong, is a necessary part of effective protest. It has to be more than just fodder for Instagram, and it has to be more than just once a year. If you feel like I've called you out, don't worry. Now I'm going to tell you how to make your protest more effective because I'm assuming that's something that you want to do. There are three key elements of successful protest. The first is that it must be disruptive. If you've ever been stuck in traffic on the day of an Extinction Rebellion March, you've experienced disruptive protest. Effective protest cannot be polite or considerate. It must call the bystander into action. And this isn't possible if it has no effect on the life of the bystander. Oftentimes, movements like XR spark conversations about whether their approach is the right way to go about addressing the issue. Commentators claim to care deeply about the climate, but their concern is just people who would have supported the movement are turned off by the method. The reality is that people who care enough about an issue to spend time protesting on it are unlikely to decide that an XR protest entirely undermines the cause of climate justice. Instead, they'll think critically about what approach they believe is best, and they might join the cause and protest in a different way. Most importantly, though, disruptive protest makes the cost of an issue clear to those who would otherwise look the other way. In that sense, it holds up a mirror. In another simpler sense, it gives powerful institutions a tangible reason to act on a social issue. Even if governments don't care about an issue, say climate change, for what it is, they might be persuaded if huge numbers of people are experiencing a disruption to their daily lives. It serves as a negotiating tool for movements to get the public on side, if not because they care about the issue, because they care about putting an end to disruption. There's a point of information. Not now, thank you. It must be acknowledged, second, is that effective protest must be acknowledged by the media. Even if you manage to hold up a sign on the busiest street corner in your city, it isn't going to be enough to sway popular sentiment to the point where the powerful are forced to respond. That type of popular pressure requires media coverage. The question, however, of how to get media attention is a complex one. Art, for example, as a form of protest is highly effective. People respond to strong, unusual, and persuasive imagery. Symbols work very well, too. Handmade costumes worn by pro-choice protesters in the United States serve as a very good example. Images can serve to draw comparisons that force onlookers to view a social issue in a very different light. Ultimately, the most important factor in ensuring media coverage is novelty. What's news this week is by the very nature of news, stale by next week. Reacting? Sure. Do you don't think that negative back from a crime from the media would be more hard than go to the current today? Yeah. So I think the distinction is between violence and disruption, and I think that distinction is essential. Because in order to justify violence, the threshold would be exceptionally high, which is what I established in the start of my speech. But to justify disruption, the threshold is much lower. And that's what this speech is centering on, because disruption in many, cases is necessary. So back to my point, which is that reacting effectively to media coverage and changing tactics to ensure newsworthiness is the only way to keep media coverage consistent beyond one 15-minute period of fame. And I think the relevant point here is that we are not talking necessarily about violence, we're talking about art. But third is that effective protest needs to be sustained. And sustainability in this context has to operate like a relay race. One person or even one group alone, cannot protest until a goal is achieved. People have lives and jobs and educations and children, and though many people are willing to make small sacrifices, short-term sacrifices, very few people are willing to make giant long-term ones. In order to keep a movement alive, there must be sufficient media coverage to bring new people into the cause and convince them that the mode of protest, whether it is art or music or anything else, is an effective way to address the issue. And now that I've explained what a successful protest requires, I want to conclude this evening by highlighting the crucial distinction between violence, which we've established is not justified, and the destruction of property. There is a tendency in the media to describe protest, which involves the destruction of property as violent. Property, however, cannot be the victim of violence. It does not feel pain, it does not die, and most importantly, it can be replaced. and though it should not be the first resort, the destruction of property should be considered an acceptable last resort. There are always risks to life, however, associated with the common tools of property destruction through the use of force or fire. And for this reason, all other methods of protest must first be exhausted, and every precaution must be taken to protect life and well-being. But destroying property can allow activists to speak the language of corporations, hitting them where it hurts, so to speak. The logic of property destruction back home in the U.S. where I'm from is that when property is damaged, insurance companies feel the hit to their bottom line, which results in the insurance lobby, then becoming more likely to push for a change to whatever it was that prompted that destruction of property in the first place. When nothing else is working, the destruction of property often does. To paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr., the riot is the language of the unheard. And I ask you all, in conclusion, to vote with a proposition tonight, not because I believe that violence is justified as a means to an end. It isn't. I ask you to vote with a proposition because though what is necessary might not be polite, it might not be considerate or fun or Instagramable, if we believe that change is necessary, we must push for it by any means, short of violence, that is necessary. Thank you very much. Thank you.
