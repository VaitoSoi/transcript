 Okay, thanks very much. I don't normally get applause when I walk into places, so it's very nice and very unusual. Just to check that I'm audible. Okay, so one of the problems of age is that you have to change glasses, which means most of you are a blur to me. I can see you clearly, but, um, um, um, one of the problems of age is that you have to change glasses, which means most of you are blurred to me. I can see you clearly, but, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, um, but at least I can read my text. And when you hear bits of your CV read out, and when you get an invitation from the Oxford Union to say, you must have learned some interesting things about financial stability and other things over a career, you realize you've reached that part of your life where actually people say, well, we really should talk about the things you did, and you've got to the point of recollections. So I thought today what I try and do is give some recollections primarily on financial stability, If you invite a central banker, you must expect a long speech. The going rate for central bankers in certain countries is at least two hours, and with algebra thrown in. I'm going to speak for about 25 minutes, but it will be on financial stability and some of the issues that I've faced over the last eight years in this job. I should say afterwards, I think we do questions, and I'm happy to talk about questions on anything and everything. but this will be, and for those of you that are not interested in central banking or whatever, either online or here in the hall, just talk amongst yourself while I go through this. So it was about, this actually exactly 25 years ago, on a day after a general election in 1997, I was handed the incoming government's surprise and detailed plan for giving the Bank of England independence in monetary policy. I was a Treasury official at the time, and I was allowed to tell only a couple of people, and together we worked through the night and over the subsequent bank holiday weekend, so that three days after taking office, the new Chancellor could announce, not just that he was giving the Bank of England independence, but from that day, but the key details of how the new system would work. And over the months that followed, we worked intensively on the legislation that would redraw the functions of the Bank of England, and we managed that legislation through Parliament until the Bank of England Act 1998 was on the statute book. The Act, though, did not mention financial stability. Even though the legislation transferred the bank's responsibility for the supervision of banks to a new authority called the Financial Services Authority, the reforms to the bank were very much focused on the issue of the time, which was the UK's high and volatile record on inflation. And there was some consideration subsequently about how the Bank of England, the new financial services authority, and the Treasury should work together on financial stability issues, and that was codified in a memorandum of understanding later in the year. But there was no statutory backing for this financial stability work, nor was the bank, or actually the financial services authority, given any specific powers to secure financial stability. I should emphasize at this point that this was not some idiosyncratic United Kingdom blind spot, as the global financial crisis was to reveal pretty brutally actually 10 years later that we simply paid insufficient attention to financial stability. We didn't read the warning signs, and when the crisis came, the institutional arrangements, not just in the UK, but across the world, were found sorely lacking. And the depth and the duration of the economic damage done by the near-death of the financial system over 10 years ago, I think was a wake-up call to us about the cost of losing financial stability and the need for greatly reinforcing the institutional arrangements to ensure that that did not happen again. And in the UK, following the model of the monetary policy reforms 10 years before, an independent committee of the Bank of England, the Financial Policy Committee, which I'm going to call the FPC, because in the bank we make acronyms out of just about everything, the FPC was established and we were armed with serious powers and charged with that responsibility to ensure financial stability. And shortly after the formal establishment of that committee, I was appointed the deputy governor with responsibility for financial stability. I've often wondered, by the way, whether this was some twist of fate that was poetic justice for the failure of my younger self some 15 years before to understand the fundamental importance of maintaining financial stability. but in any event, I've spent the last eight years trying to embed and to develop the domestic and the international machinery to ensure that we can have a vibrant and an innovative financial system but without periodic financial stability crisis. And I want this evening to set out some of the key lessons I've learned over that period about the FPC's objectives and its scope and also maybe to talk a little bit about some of the challenges we now face, including the challenge of what's happening. in Ukraine. And for those of you, well, actually it's nobody, but for those of you maybe at home frantically taking notes, if there is anybody, this speech is being published on the bank's website with more details and numbers, so you can just sit back and relax and listen or do whatever you were otherwise going to do. So I'll start with a question that I've been asked many times over the last eight years is, what exactly you're trying to achieve? And it's a very reasonable, but it's a rather awkward question. There are many indicators. of financial activity, but there's no single metric, no quantified objective for financial stability, as we have for monetary policy, the 2% inflation target. So my answer of what are you trying to achieve is actually rooted in a human characteristic that makes financial activity and indeed economic growth possible, which is our ability to envisage the future. So human beings, I think, are unique, they're probably unique in being able to imagine the future. I say probably because there is actually now some evidence that certain animals might be able to a limited degree to share our ability to what some researchers have termed mental time travel. The ability we have in our minds not only to recall the past, but to use past experience and present experience to form expectations about the future. And I guess, although it's not my specialism, that mental time travel evolved because it gave us as a species an advantage. And it's fundamental to the development of economic life, because economic life is inextricably bound up with our ability to form expectations of what will happen in the future and actually to make claims upon the future. Think of pensions, for example. However, though we can envisage the future as a species, we can't know it. And whether we form our expectations by extrapolating our memory of the past or whether they're rationally formed on the basis of all available evidence, and that's a big debate in economics, our expectations no more than that. And when, for whatever reason, the future does not live up to those expectations, there has to be some sort of correction. And such corrections happen every day, of course. The future, when it arrives, can exceed or disappoint our expectations, and investors make money, or they lose money as a result. However, if that correction is very large and widespread, the shock can endanger the financial system as a whole. And this correction can come because the expectations we made about the future have become highly unrealistic and cannot be sustained, and that's what happened in the years leading up to the great global financial crisis. But it can also happen because some unanticipated event causes a sharp adjustment in our expectations, has happened at the beginning of the COVID pandemic in February and March 2020, and indeed it may be happening now as expectations adjust to the reality of the invasion of a peaceful European country by its neighbor. Such corrections can't be avoided. There are a feature of the financial system generated by the fact, as I say, that we can envisage the future, but we can't predict it. And the task of financial stability authorities is to ensure that when those shocks occur, the financial system is resilient, so it doesn't amplify the impact on the real economy, which is what happened back in 2008, but is able to absorb it and actually dampen the impact, if possible. It follows from this that financial stability authorities must focus on what could happen rather than what's most likely to happen. Of all of the dismal science of economists, we're probably the most dismal of the lot. This is very different to monetary policy. For the monetary policy committee on which I sit, the key question is, what's our central forecast? What's the most likely outcome and the risks around that most likely outcome for inflation, for GDP, and in the light of that, how should we set policy to respond? The financial policy committee's primary concern is not the central probability, what is most likely to happen. Rather, the key question for us is what could plausibly happen, and if that happened, would the financial system amplify or would it dampen the shock? That's the basis on which we stress test the core banking system every year. To be very clear, we don't sit down and try to anticipate specific types of shock, like there'll be a pandemic or there'll be a war. Rather, we use historical data to anticipate the impacts any major shock could have on the economy, on growth, on inflation, on unemployment, on house prices. We then test the major banks to ensure they can withstand a scenario comprising those economic and market impacts. And the benefit of focusing on so-called tail events, events in the time, tail of the distribution, the probability distribution. In other words, what could happen were demonstrated, I think, pretty vividly at the beginning of the COVID crisis two years ago. The realization of the impact the pandemic was going to have led to an abrupt and very large correction in the expectation that people had of economic prospects. And that happened in a matter of days and weeks. But unlike the great financial crisis, that correction did not lead to a loss of confidence, lead to the collapse of the banking system. Banks were resilient. They were able in those initial months before we knew about government action to support the economy to actually extend lending to the economy. I think bank lending in March 2020 was 30 times its average. So the banks were resilient. So focusing on the tail event on what could have been, could have happened, I think, has proved to be key in ensuring the banking system, which was the epicenter of the financial crisis, supports financial stability. That leads me to a second lesson I've learned over the past eight years. That was the banking system, but financial stability is about more than just the banking system. Non-bank finance, and by that I mean this vast ecosystem of investment funds, pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign and private wealth funds, now account for about half of global financial assets. and most of the growth in finance that we've seen across the world since the financial crisis in 2008-9 has actually come on the non-bank, rather than the bank side. And non-bank finance carries different than perhaps lesser risks than banks. Unlike banks, it's not really an issue of large systemic institutions, but more an issue of correlated actions by a large number of diverse players. But the sector does present its own financial stability risks. It can be subject to run risk where investors seek to redeem their investments, and this leads for demands for liquidity to meet those redemptions, often at a time when markets are most illiquid. Non-banks are highly interconnected with the rest of the financial system, which means that shocks can transmit very quickly to systemic institutions, including to banks. And the Financial Policy Committee has been concerned for a number of years about how this kind of ecosystem of market-based finance might behave under a severe stress. But given the breadth of the sector, the lack of data, just the number and the diversity of the participants, and the fact that much of this is cross-border and international, has made it really impossible for us to apply a stress test approach of the sort that I just described for banks. We do now, however, have the result of a real-life stress, not a test, which is that COVID shock of two years ago, and that exposed some important vulnerabilities in non-bank finance. In February 2020, as the implications of the pandemic became clearer, there was what we call a flight to safety. Investors shifted from risky assets to safer and more liquid assets, and the price of safe assets like government bonds and gold went up. And such a shift is exactly the correction you'd expect, given just how great we had to, the adjustment in expectations was when COVID struck. but the non-bank financial system, unlike the banking system, proved unable to manage that correction. Around the first week of March 2020, what had been a move to safe assets, a flight to safety, turned into an accelerating dash for liquidity, the so-called dash for cash. So in order to obtain cash, and with markets for less liquid assets completely closed, investors sold their safe assets, their government bonds, price of gold, actually, which is where people normally go when they're worried about the future, went down. And as the price of safe assets dropped, the dash for cash was amplified by other mechanisms in the market. And we saw in the first and second week of March 2020 that the core financial markets just began to seize up. And so at a time of great stress, when the global economy needed the support of easier financing conditions, the opposite was happening. market interest rates were going up. So in a nutshell, the dash for cash was amplifying the economic stress of the pandemic. And the only way we were able to halt those self-reinforcing dynamics was by massive, and I mean massive, central bank intervention to support the market and restore order. So over that short period, around the world, central banks announced the purchase of about $1.5 trillion of bonds to break the dynamics of the dash for cash. and support the economy. So the real life stress test of March 2020 demonstrated how non-bank finance can amplify shocks. In November 2020, the International Financial Stability Board, which serves the same purpose internationally as the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England, published an initial analysis of how the various elements of the system may have contributed and reinforced that stress. And further, more detailed work, underway in the international regulatory community. But until we actually get to the point of taking coordinated international action to address these vulnerabilities, in my view, we remain vulnerable to the risk that the non-bank financial system could amplify a major future correction to expectations. And I'll return to that concern later when I address the financial stability challenges we face at the present time. Before doing that, I want briefly to touch on two other lessons that I've learned about financial stability. The first is it's not just about banks, and actually, financial stability is not just about the financial sector. One reason why the recession following the financial crisis was so deep. Our recovery from the recession after the financial crisis of 2008 was longer than our recovery from the Great Depression in the 1920s. One reason why it was so deep and so long was in the crisis, Highly indebted households, households with a lot of debt, cut back most sharply on their consumption. And that in turn prolonged and it deepened the recession and then added further damage to the financial sector. And household debt relative to household income is a really important metric for financial stability. There's a sizable body of research on the link between high levels and fast growth in household debt and financial crises. In 2014, the FPC introduced policy measures. to constrain the growth of household mortgage debt to income, particularly in the event of a housing boom. And last year we published our latest review and some proposed adjustment to those measures. So we've published extensive evidence and research on the impact these measures have and the role they play. And I won't go into this in detail. I think, though, it's reasonable to conclude that the measures we took have had an impact in keeping household debt growing in line with household income. and moreover in keeping house price growth more in line with the growth of income. And the FPC's action on mortgages, I think, can be viewed through that same lens I had earlier of expectations and corrections. When household expectations of future prospects and income have to adjust sharply, like in a recession, that correction is more damaging, both to the economy and to the financial sector, if household debt to income is high. And the final lesson I'm going to touch on briefly is that financial stability, is about more than financial risks. The financial system is also vulnerable to operational risks, which, if they turn out to crystallize, could just bring key elements of the system down and cause a financial crisis. Quite early in its existence, the FPC recognized the importance, for example, of the risks of cyber attacks on the financial system, and we instituted a program of cyber penetration of key financial firms and of cyber stress testing of key parts of the system. I have to say that those risks look less and less like tail risks by the day. And this area of the financial policy committee's work is very different to the work of ensuring that the banking system can absorb losses or that the non-bank financial system isn't prone to severe liquidity stress. But as I say, as recent events demonstrate, this is an essential part of ensuring financial stability. So having looked back at some of the lessons of the past eight years, I want to conclude by looking forward at some of the challenges to financial stability we face. And I'll begin by briefly highlighting two challenges that are likely to be with the Financial Policy Committee for many years and long after I've left the committee and I have another 20 months left on my terms. So this will go on a lot longer than that, which are climate change and crypto. And I'll then spend a little more time on the immediate challenges we face of high inflation, the tightening of monetary policy and a war in Europe. So climate change is in many senses the most systemic risk we face as a society and as an economy, as the IPCC's latest report on Monday reminds us. The physical effects of climate change, such as more frequent, severe weather events, but also the policies that may be necessary to reach net zero have and can carry substantial risks to the financial system if we don't prepare for them. Many in government, industry and finance are now working to support that transition to a net zero economy. But the future temperature pathway and the policy outlook remains uncertain. And to help the financial system make those essential preparations and to navigate through the uncertainties that I think climate change poses, we can use climate scenario analysis and those same techniques of stress testing to ensure that the system is resilient to a range of possible futures. So we're currently considering the outcome of the UK's first stress test to assess the resilience of the core financial system, banks and insurance companies, and key players, to different climate scenarios. And over time, that sort of exercise, that stress testing exercise should give us a much better understanding of climate-related vulnerability, that exist across the financial system and shape our policy response to ensure that the system is resilient and can contribute to the transition to net zero. And that's going to be an increasing focus of the FPC's work for many years. The advent of crypto technology in finance poses a very different set of questions. To go back to fundamentals, recording and transferring and verifying the ownership of assets is actually the bedrock of the financial system. role in storing value and transferring value and making transactions between people. And crypto technology in the public blockchain enables recording, verification and transfer to take place without the banks or the other intermediaries that have historically carried out that function. So at present, these crypto technologies have been used in finance, mainly to create speculative investment assets like Bitcoin. So before somebody asks me later on, should I buy Bitcoin, somebody normally does, I'll just say these are highly volatile assets because they have no intrinsic value, which is an economist's way of saying that there's nothing behind them, so there's nothing to prevent the price going to zero if that's where the price goes. The value of such assets has grown very rapidly over the past few years, and they're beginning to become connected to the conventional financial system. And we've also seen strong growth, though, from a lower base in so-called stable coins, crypto assets used for crypto payments like Tether and Ether. And more recently, we've seen early but interesting examples of the combination of crypto technology and the public blockchain with so-called smart contracts to offer financial services like lending or derivatives algorithmically without human intervention and completely outside the conventional financial system and completely outside financial regulation. So crypto writ large, all of those things, is not at present large enough or connected enough to represent a financial stability risk. But it's growing very rapidly and the technology is developing extremely quickly. I'm not a technologist, but I think it's a fairback that the use of these technologies in finance will offer benefits and will grow. And as it does so, the distinction between the crypto world and the world of conventional finance, I think, will become less and less distinct. This will be a major focus of financial stability authorities and other regulatory authorities in coming years. Regulatory authorities are now engaging to ensure a vital principle that we protect against the same risks to the same extent whether a financial activity is being carried out using conventional finance technology or whether it's being carried out in the crypto world. And that will take us many, many years to do as this. technology develops and becomes more embedded in the financial sector. So finally, we're near the end now, I want to return to non-bank finance and just the near-term challenges that we face at the moment. I noted earlier that non-bank finance makes up about half of the global financial system. And the growth of this channel of finance has benefits. One of the lessons we learned, by the way, in the financial crisis was that economies that were over-dependent on the banking channel for providing credit to the economic. economy suffered more when that channel broke because of over-reliance. And clearly if you have another channel of finance, non-bank finance, that gives you resilience. But much of the growth of non-bank finance since the financial crisis has also been characterized by the so-called search for yield. In other words, these markets have expanded in a world of very low interest rates and abundant liquidity, which has been necessary to return chronically low inflation to target and to support economic growth. So over the period of investors have searched for higher returns, they've taken on more risk. And there's been a marked growth in riskier types of debt and in equity markets, and lending standards have also weakened, which increases the risk. Economic and financial conditions are now changing. The restarting of the world economy following the pandemic has led to major supply-side disruptions and strong inflationary pressures across the world. In many advanced economies, central banks have entered a monetary policy tightening phase. And as interest rates rise to combat inflation and as quantitative easing comes to an end, financial asset prices change and investors rebalance their portfolios. The adjustment of the new environment has already started. The price of the riskier assets has fallen as expectations of higher interest rates have increased over recent months. To be clear, a period of adjustment. to bring the price of riskier financial assets in line with a new economic and financial environment is not in itself a financial stability event. But that adjustment is not without risks. Market expectations of interest rates should, of course, be factored already into financial asset prices. But if those expectations were to change suddenly, and markets began to expect much higher interest rates, we could see even sharper movements out of risky assets. Moreover, if expectations of economic prospects deteriorated, if there were expectations of weaker growth and higher inflation, concerns about creditworthiness could reinforce the selling of risky debt and equities. To those challenges, we now have to add, unfortunately, the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which is the first such event in Europe for over 70 years. As with the COVID pandemic, the events of the last few days have led to an abrupt shift of expectations about the future and a huge increase in uncertainty. So it's not yet clear how those events will play out or what their longer-term impact will be, including in economic and financial terms. Russia is a relatively small part of the world economy accounts for about 2% of global GDP, but of course it accounts for a larger share of the world's supply of energy and of other commodities. The sanctions that have been announced will severe damage to the Russian economy, but they should not, in and of themselves, pose material risks to financial stability more broadly. But the heightened perception of geopolitical risk and the potential impacts on growth and inflation can only increase risks around that adjustment away from risky assets that I mentioned earlier. And this comes during a period when market liquidity is relatively low. And it also comes against the background of those vulnerabilities I talked about earlier in non-bank finance, the vulnerabilities that were exposed in the dash for cash two years ago, and that led to powerful and adverse liquidity dynamics under stress. While I've said there's been considerable and valuable work to analyze and understand those vulnerabilities, we've also, as I've said, not yet actually taken any action to address them. Financial stability authorities like the FPC are, of course, closely watching how these adjustments to expectations unfold and will act as necessary to protect financial stability. I'm not saying that markets will be unable to manage the necessary adjustments, nor am I saying that we will experience another dash for cash. But all of this, in my view, underlines my first lesson. The securing financial stability means ensuring the financial system has the resilience to withstand severe and unanticipated shocks, however they are generated, and ensuring that it is able to dampen rather than amplify their impact on the real economy. Now, I think we've made great progress towards that goal over the last eight years, but I think there's still much to do. And it's important that we maintain our commitment and take the action that's necessary to ensure that our financial system is resilient. I started this talk by talking about how 25 years ago we'd, did not pay sufficient attention to financial stability. The subsequent lessons we learned were pretty painful and very hard one. I very much hope that as those events become more distant, we don't forget them. Thank you. When they told me earlier they'd move the lectern after I spoke, I thought I might be honest at the time, But no, okay, that's fine. Okay, I might just get some water. Do help yourself. Thank you so much for joining us and for such a fantastic speech. I'd like to track back to the beginning of your career, if you don't mind, since you've told us so much about financial stability. But you began your career in the Treasury. Did you always intend to work in this area? Was financial stability an interest you've had for a long time? Or was it something you found yourself sort of, So I, well, it depends what you, when you think a career starts. So I guess I started my career in the academic world as a teaching assistant and junior lecturer in Canada in English literature and drama. So I have got a master's degree, but it's in the influence of the Bible and Oscar Wilde. So at that point, no, I didn't really think I was going to have a master's degree, but it's in the influence of the Bible and Oscar Wilde. I was going to have a career in economics and finance. And I think probably if somebody had said to me when I was your age that you're going to wind up as Deputy Governor for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, I might have thought they were being offensive. I might have thought they'd either drunk too much or consumed something else they shouldn't have consumed. So I had no idea that I would do this. And I think for much of my career at that point, I was very interested in Elizabethan and Jacoby in drama, and I had ambitions to be a theatre director. So, no. I can talk if you want about how I got from where I was to where I am, but this was not a plan. My next question was I was going to ask you about when you became the UK permanent representative to the European Union, your experience with the European Union. So perhaps if you'd like to talk a bit about how your career tracked from the Treasury to where you are now, I joined the civil service. I started in the Department of Transport, actually the Department of Environment, and then moved to the Department of Transport, and then got sent to the Treasury. I had no formal training at that point in economics and finance. The Treasury gave me a bit of extra training, and then I sort of worked through the Treasury until I was responsible for international finance. and actually macroeconomics, although I don't hold a degree in economics. I worked a lot with the current Chancellor, Gordon Brown. When he went to Downing Street, he asked me if I would go with him or to the Cabinet office and to do this role as his advisor on international economic affairs and Europe. So it seemed an interesting thing to do. As I say, this has not been a career that's had a plan. it's been a series of fortunate accidents and that was an opportunity that not many people get so I took that opportunity Gordon Brown left after the election of 2010 I stayed on with David Cameron for a couple of years and then basically he suggested I go to to Europe to European Union as I'd be working on Europe for the last 20 years to do the job of that permanent representative in Brussels, which is a small and select group of people who've done that job now because it's come to an end. And given your insights that you've gained throughout your career, do you think that the general public in the UK have a good conception of the UK's relationship with the EU and with financial stability, or do you think that it's something that's they're often misled about? I think in the UK, and I've seen this play out over my career, the European Union was never, or our membership of the European Union, was never in the main an affair of the heart. And it was always based around what you might call a more transactional approach to Europe. for those of you that remember, and probably many of you don't, but it was seen as a trade primarily when we joined. It was seen as a trade arrangement that would be good for us economically, at a time when we were economically extremely weak. But I don't think it was ever seen as a passionate commitment on the UK side to the spirit of Europe. And that's not a criticism. I mean, it has a lot to do with British history and culture. It's a lot to do with very different experiences in the Second World War that the UK had compared to the rest of Europe. But I'd say that you... One could go to a European Council and other leaders could come out and talk about how they'd taken certain action. They'd done certain things for the spirit of Europe. You rarely heard, in my experience, a British Prime Minister make that. statement because actually in the UK, I don't think membership of the European Union resonated in that deep way. And if you look at the history of our membership from Fontainebleau and the rebate through through to our opt-outs on justice and home affairs, the euro, a range of things, I think our membership and our ability as a country, our willingness as a country, as a whole, so countries made up on lots of different parts of opinion to actually engage fully in the European Union over the period of our membership was less than others. And I don't, I'm not saying that's a good or a bad thing. I mean, views on Europe are very divided in this country and they're very mixed up, I think, with other things as well. But I think that's a reality. I felt that reality very much as the permanent representative in 2012, 2013. You felt that reality while working on European affairs. We'll see how the future now plays out, but I just think the UK has always had a different relationship and a different attitude towards Europe than the majority of member states. And you spoke about how your role in the Bank of England has changed and sort of what you're looking for going forward. What should the general public be paying attention to you in the next two years of, I suppose, British finance and economics? So I think the general public shouldn't have to worry about financial stability. I mean, this is quite basic. I mean, these are things that people like me are paid to deal with, but actually people don't want to worry about financial stability. They don't want to worry about the economy. They want to concentrate on their lives and the like. I think the issues that we face, we've got to worry about. we're going to face a period that's in the Bank of England's forecasts of high inflation. I think people should be confident that the Bank of England will do whatever is necessary to keep inflation under control. I don't think there's anybody I'm looking round in this room apart from me. That's the advantage of being old. Who can remember the inflation of the 1970s? I was at university, studying for my finals when we had the three-day week and the economy stopped. but when I came out we had extremely high inflation caused by the oil crisis. That is damaging for society and the economy as a whole. It's actually most damaging for the poorest people. So I don't think people ought to worry about that. I don't think they have to because of the Bank of England. But clearly now is a difficult time. And I think people will be concerned about the events that are unfolding on our television screens and what that means for the economy. But again, it's our job to manage through those shocks and try and ensure stability. Well, I'm keen to leave plenty of time for audience questions. If you have a question, please raise your hand or your membership card. Anybody wants to ask me about the influence of the Bible and Oscar Wilde. I'm prepared to talk about that as well. Yes. Yes, please. Thank you so much. It's so interesting. I was struck when you mentioned that in 1997 and thereafter no one could see the problem. Do you think there is a problem as the media makes out that there's a sort of whitehall bubble where everyone thinks the same thing? And if so, were you and Gordon Brown and so on in it? And if so, what can be done about it for the future? Thank you. Yeah. So it's a really good question. It's a question about group think, I think, which, you know, it could be whitehall. It could be anywhere. I mean, do people have self-reinfor? Do we kind of reinforce it tendencies? I think primarily it was a problem of history. We hadn't had financial crises bank runs in the UK since the 19th century. I never thought. I thought bank runs, I don't know how many people here have seen Mary Poppins the film, but I mean that was the only bank run I'd ever seen until 1997. And they happened in history books and the like. So I think some of this was we had forgotten and it hadn't been taken in to the received body of economic and financial thinking. If you think about research, academic research at that time, didn't really sort of think about those possibilities of financial stability. The Queen, when she addressed the Royal Society of the Economist after the crisis, asked one of those penetrating simple questions, why did nobody see it coming? And the society then put together its greatest brains and sent in a very long and detailed explanation. But the fact is these things were not in the body, of work that people studied and thought about. And as a result, we did get into a situation. It's not just the UK, it's worldwide, where we saw warning signs like the Asian financial crisis, the Mexican financial crisis, the Russian financial crisis. And it didn't really hit home that what we're observing was a feature of the liberalisation that had happened without the necessary regulation to go around it. Why does that happen? I think some of it is diversity. So you tend to get in places like the civil service, the banking system, whatever. People who've been through a similar training, people have had a similar experience, and they tend to see things in the same way. It may have happened because of an over-specialization, which again led to a narrowness of focus. I think there is a lot to be said for opening up our institutions to people well I would say this as somebody who started in one sphere of academic work and wound up something completely different. But I do think people with different perspectives because they come from different social backgrounds or because they have different life experiences to help guard against that. But it's something that, shall we say, policy elites need to be thinking about all the time. Yeah. And we'll take a question from the member in the jump. Hi. So my question is about the resilience of the financial system to a breakdown in bank lending, bank finance. So you mentioned that in cases like those, what matters is having a non-bank finance as a key part of the economy. and that economies that rely less on bank finance will do better in response to certain financial shocks. And I'm interested in maybe the welfare cost of relying too much on non-bank finance because if you think about maybe the key markets in which non-bank finance plays out, it is extension of credit to large corporations and not so much to the real economy. households and small firms. And I'm wondering what the bank's view is on that. How does a small business or a household get credit when bank finance breaks down? I know there's some non-bank mortgage lenders, but, you know, what, yeah, what's the bank's view on that? Okay. So the first thing I say is resilience is often about having more than one channel. So people, after the financial crisis, made this point that the US had suffered less economic damage than some of the European countries because the US had developed market-based finance. They said, you know, you have a spare wheel, you have an extra tire, a spare tire when something goes wrong. It's true the other way around as well. You know, if you have a crisis in market-based finance, you want a resilient banking system. I think I'll go back to this. I think the banking system at the moment is pretty resilient. it has capital that can absorb losses and it has liquidity. And I make that point that before governments really stepped in just to cushion the shock of COVID, the pandemic, yet we didn't see what would have happened in 2008. Markets immediately would have driven banks to the edge because they'd have said this pandemic will result in so many losses that you'll be in solvent. So I think at the moment we're kind of well served. The second question, though, is where is finance going? Sorry, to what is it being directed, which I think is really your question. I don't think there's an issue of consumer finance to households or mortgage finance. But I think there really is an issue about finance to small businesses. For those of you that know your history, this has been a problem in the UK since before the Second World War. So there have been numerous reports done about the provision of finance to small businesses. business and also the provision of finance to that section of small business, which are startups, growth businesses, kind of innovation. And I don't think in this country we have a particularly strong system for managing that. During the COVID pandemic, we have the bounce-back loans where the government pretty much guaranteed loans to small businesses and thousands of small businesses that would never have borrowed, you know, actually borrowed. But do we have the right financial system in this country to support small businesses and growth enterprises? I think there's still an awful lot to do. It may be that some of the new technologies, it may be the internet. You know, we talk about crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending. And it has to be a bit careful because some of those things, you know, have only exist when times are good, but they disappear when times are bad and they're quite fragile. But I do think that it's a problem in the European economies as well. There needs to be kind of more work on channeling finance to the small business sector and the like. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean because sometimes in a stress, you know, some businesses will fail. And there's nothing one can do about that if the business model is gone. But I think there's more we can do, particularly in business as usual, to support small businesses in finance. I'm going to take one more brief question from the members on the front. No, that's okay. Thank you so much. I have actually two questions. The first one is regarding that yields in developed, Yeah, in the developer, basically there are now increasing liabilities in terms of health care and pensions all over in the development, which is why a lot of money is going to be chasing yields all around, which sort of means that the non-banking sector is only going to grow more, whereas money goes more into the private markets. You mentioned here that there's a lot of problems in terms of data from those markets, and how do you basically... assess the financial stability of that market when you know for a fact or you can reasonably assume that that market is going to grow a lot in the future. We'll take just that question. We'll just take that question because we're running out of time, but thank you. Yes. So, first thing I says, I think an integrated global financial sector is a good thing, provided it exists within the right government's framework. So if pension savings in countries with elderly populations can be invested in economic activity, in countries with younger, with different demographics, and fuel and drive their economic growth, in principle, that is a good thing. What I think you have to be careful about is that those flows to and from are not volatile. because actually it matters as much that, if you like, flows of finance, out of pension funds into other economies cross-border don't kind of come in a rush and depart in a rush. And they can depart because suddenly investment opportunities look more attractive in other countries and, you know, American interest rates, US dollar interest rates go up and sort of investment comes out of emerging markets. and they can also move because of the conditions in some of the developing and emerging countries that cause the funds to leave or the sucks the funds in. I think we have got better about managing those flows. So we went through COVID without the sort of emerging market financial crises that we saw in the 1990s. I think those emerging markets have become better at managing things, but those things still exist. And you don't want the pipes through which. this investment flows, the funds, etc., to actually be amplifying the volatility of the flows. And for that, I think we need better data. But we also need to manage some of the problems around liquidity risk that I was talking about in non-bank finance. But that will need coordinated international action because this is really a global cross-border market and no one jurisdiction by itself can solve it. So, John, thank you so much for joining us. We'll finish with. with a question that we ask all of our speakers, if you could give our members just one thing to think about for the rest of this week, what would that be? Well, it's a depressing, but think about the impact on what I would call the global order of what you're seeing happening now in Ukraine. I think it is a fundamental change. One hopes it will be kind of it'll be a temporary turning on the road and we'll turn back again. But I don't want to press you at kind of a young stage of your lives, but actually just think about the ramifications and the importance when you can, when you leave here or whatever, of trying to do things that actually push the other way in the careers you take up. Thank you so much for your insight. Please join me in thanking Sir John Kahn. Thank you.
