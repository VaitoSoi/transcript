 Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the honour to speak in this debate and bringing this motion to the attention of our members. The issue of same-sex marriage is indeed a very topical one, and one which is currently being discussed in the church, indeed at the next general synod being held next Monday in London, which I was very happy to hear that many bishops sitting with us today will be attending. Admittedly, this is a sensitive and divisive issue, and though I am surprised to be standing on this side of the dispatch box, representing a view which I'm personally opposed to, I think this really cuts to the heart of what the Oxford Union is about, which is about having these difficult conversations and embracing new perspectives. Tonight, side opposition will be advocating a viewpoint in which many members of the Church of England hold, that same-sex marriage should not be permitted within the confines of the church. Given that this motion is gravely oversimplified, it's worth stating that this is not a binary debate, of for or against. Rather, it is far more nuanced. Opposition here are not standing condemning the rights of people to identify and express themselves is sexually, but equally we're not going to shy away from the fact that the church does hold socially conservative views, which are at odds with the modern fabric of society. Given this, we want to have a realistic discussion of what sexual diversity could look like in the church and why there are potential arguments against this. Having said that, my case tonight will be centred around two main questions. Firstly, why this motion only supports surface-level change for the status of same-sex couples within the church. And secondly, why the motion is not a question of civil rights, and instead why the church and other religious entities are entitled to their own concept of morality and what they deem is good within their own theological frameworks. But before I go on to my arguments, it falls upon me to introduce your speakers proposing the motion tonight, albeit in a less funny way than Jenny did. you've just heard from Jenny Heath a first year at Oriel College and one of the press officers on committee in the union this term. I got to know Jenny when we ran on the same slate last term in the election and though we were technically political rivals then I'm very happy to say that she's a personal friend of mine now. The three bishops sat in front of me on side proposition tonight the bishop of Buckingham, the bishop of Dudley and the bishop of Worcester speaking in that order all senior figures in the church who have first hand seen the internal matters of the same-sex marriage play out and are very well placed to offer their insights in tonight's debate. Mr. President, these are your speakers and they are most welcome. Now on with my arguments and why this motion only supports surface level change and why if we genuinely want a world where heterosexual and homosexual members of the church are equal, then this is not enough. we have to actually ask ourselves, what are we debating tonight? Because despite what the motion reads, the real question is not about gay marriage, but it's instead about the church recognizing gay people within the church as equal members of the spiritual community. If we think about it, for a gay person, yes, the problem is that they are not able to marry in the church. But the larger and the more fundamental problem is the Church of England's theological position in its most orthodox states that homosexuality is fundamentally unnatural and sinful. due to the lack of procreation, a view that nowadays prevents gay Christians in 23 from fully expressing their sexual orientation. There is significant debate on the theology and the doctrine behind this position itself, and despite me being a theology student, I will leave that to the bishop sat beside me to discuss who have far more expertise and knowledge on the subject than I do. Instead, what I want to touch on is this wider problem, which is whether as a society we can reconcile these socially conservative views with modern liberal thinking, because this is what the debate is really about. As a society, we are currently at the apex in our public discourse on gender, identity, sexuality and expression, and every day we are questioning and revising old views so that they can fit in with our modern thinking and what we deem to be acceptable in society. We've seen this with the issues of racial and gender equality and how these have developed because of this moral evolution that we are undergoing. Given this, it is no surprise that religious institutions and governments alike are struggling to keep up with these developments, rapidly reconsidering how we redefine our human values and what human unions and what exclusive commitments look like in society. However, whilst both face the same problems, the distinction here is that unlike governments and public bodies, the church is underpinned by thousands of years' worth of dogmatic theological belief, which is justified not by public or logical reason, but by the private reasoning of only those who decide to emotion. subscribe to God. And this is the problem because there's no getting around this. This history and this reasoning is so ingrained into the fabric of the church that whether we allow same-sex marriages or we don't, this is not going to change the fundamental attitude. And though this is not the way that we like it to be, side opposition is just being honest and realistic in recognizing that the problems go much deeper than we think. And that this issue bleeds so much into the modern church that any attempt the church now makes to keep up with progressive society, whether that be through same-sex blessings or same-sex marriages are shown to be inadequate in making gay members of the church feel truly value due to this profound theological history. Therefore, if we genuinely want to see greater sexual and gender diversity in the church, a goal shared across both sides of the house tonight, then we need to target this structural problem of belief and dogma, rather than proposing a band-aid solution just so that the church can keep up with society. Whether the church is able to solve these structural problems or not is an entirely other debate. But what side opposition hopes to highlight is that now more than ever, in this state of moral flux, the church has this duty to its members to clarify exactly what their values are, exactly where their doctrine lies, and essentially totally revise things so that they are able to genuinely affirm the status of gay people and gay marriage in the church in a holistic way. The second argument I'm going to bring about is the question of rights. The idea that if the church looked in the mirror today, and decided that they wanted to hold socially conservative views, and whether we as a chamber agreed with that or not, that there is a genuine case for them being entitled to do so. Unlike the state or governing bodies, the church is its own private entity, and thus their beliefs do not have to be informed by public rights and public liberties that we are familiar with, but instead their own conception of good and what works within their own theological framework. In fact, it's very important in this debate. It's crucial, in fact, to make this distinction between church and state. Just because by law, people in society are able to marry in a certain way does not mean that they are entitled to marry in the same way within the church. As a private institution, the church is able to set their own parameters of what marriage should look like and for that to be a condition of association into the church. For them, that's between one woman and one man for the purpose of procreation. This is not a belief system that we are defending. Rather, this is just something that the law protects and something we see many examples of in society. For example, just like the church is a private group of believers in faith, the Oxford Union similarly is a private entity, which you only have exclusive access to if you have paid membership. The difference between the union and the church, obviously, is that the Church of England has had far more influence over British public life than arguably any other body or worldview, underpinning the ethics of our justice system, creating the foundation of our social services. So, therefore, all of the influence that the church has had in our society, is very important in this debate. However, this does not mean that the church's views have to bend towards a social norm, as this is just not the case. Given the recent rise of atheism and non-religious belief, the church now more than ever is its own independent entity. And just because society has revised views on what a flourishing human union looks like does not mean that the church has to blindly follow suit and, in fact, to do so would be a breach of the church's own right to religious freedom. So in this way, our side is able to get around the language of rights, which I suspect the proposition will be using, affirming that religious marriage in itself is not a right versus the ability to express freedom of religious belief, which is. To conclude, I'd like to leave you with these remarks. Though many of you, such as myself, might have come into this chamber with a clear idea of what you thought on this motion, I hope that after you've heard all the speeches tonight, you can come out with a greater recognition of all the different range of viewpoints and stakeholders on the table. this topic. And the realization that this is not a black and white debate, it's not just a matter of foreign against, but instead what we're touching on here is a wider question of society. Can society reconcile competing worldviews? Can a pluralist society do this? And fundamentally, can we reconcile our past with our present? Thank you.
