 Thank you for joining us, Thank you for joining us, Congressman. I wanted to join. Thank you for joining us, Congressman. I wanted to start the first question today. You began your career as a, you began your career as a, you as a litigator for a big law firm. What made you decide to switch from law to politics? Well, it's great question. Thank you, Ahmad. It's great to be here at the historic Oxford Union and to be amongst you. Thank you for coming out on a Friday evening, on a college campus, when I know there's a lot that is going on and I appreciate this invitation. It's a great honor. When I was on a call, college campus, I went to the State University of New York at Binghamton. In my senior year, there was a situation that had occurred in the prior year where an African American motorist was pulled over in Los Angeles, brutally beaten, almost to death, without justification. And it was caught on camera. And that was a very unique thing at the time. 1991, I'm dating myself. At this point, there were no cell phones. And so while instances of police brutality were clear to many of us, particularly those of us who grew up in inner city, predominantly African-American communities, It's not to say that the majority of police officers back at home or, you know, throughout the country or the world aren't hardworking public servants who are there to protect and serve. They are. But as we've now seen in very clear ways, there are challenges in terms of the police use of excessive force, police violence, police brutality. But back then, prior to everyone having a camera, on their cell phone or smartphone, it was very rare. And the police were always given the benefit of the doubt. So in this particular situation in 1991, there happened to have been a bystander who for some reason had a camcorder, a video recorder. Y'all know what a camcorder is? I had a handheld camcorder. And from across the highway was able to record the entire encounter that all the world saw. This was the Rodney King case. Rodney King, if you look it up, was the police beating that subsequently led to the civil disturbance in Los Angeles. in 92 when Los Angeles went up in flames. And what happened is four officers, all of whom were white, who were the most abusive, went on trial and were acquitted by a jury, notwithstanding the fact that everyone saw what happened was almost as if, almost as if the officer who was accused and charged with killing George Floyd and everybody saw what happened would have gotten off. In this case, those four officers were somehow acquitted. LA exploded. When that happened, it was toward the end of my senior year, and I came to the conclusion that while we made a lot of progress in America, we still had a long way to go in the context of racial and social justice. And I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do with it, but at that moment I knew I wanted to be part of the solution. And I wound up graduating, going off to get a master's in public policy, then going to law school, and knew that I wanted to use my law degree to advance the cause of social justice to try to make a difference. And after spending a few years at the law firm beginning to perfect the art and science of the law, I decided that instead of advocating for clients at the firm, I wanted to be an advocate for my community. And that's when I made the transition. to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly. But ultimately, the initial spark came at that moment on the college campus when I saw the injustice of the verdict and decided that I wanted to be part of making a society a better place. Yeah, sounds incredible. Would you say you have been more effective in making a difference as a politician now? now that you've made that transition? Well, I think that being in office at any level of government provides such a unique opportunity in that, you know, you really have the opportunity to make a retail difference and then hopefully also a wholesale difference, a retail difference, you know, in the context of you have a constituent. he or she has a problem. It could be an immigration problem. It could be a government benefits problem. It could be a problem navigating a governmental agency and it just frustrated with the inefficiency of bureaucracy. Whatever the case may be, you've got that dynamic, that situation. And you're called upon to help them. And that's one of the best feelings in the world when you can address their challenge. But then there are also wholesale opportunities that you have to impact the budget or pass, you know, transformative, hopefully legislation will be part of that effort where you affect, you know, thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of people. And that also, I think, you know, is gratifying as well. Yeah. So on the political side of things, your chair of the House Democratic Caucus. The House Democratic Caucus is politically very diverse. So it's ranging from centrist to democratic socialist. How do you balance the interest of such different and sometimes even opposing groups? Yeah, I mean, the House Democratic Caucus is incredibly diverse in every possible way. In fact, over the last two Congresses, the Democratic Caucus in the House is the most diverse legislative caucus in the history of the country. And over that period of time, starting with the class of 2018, when they were elected, giving Democrats the majority, had more women serving in Congress than ever before, more African-Americans, more Latinos, more Asian-Americans, more members of the LGBTQ community, two Native American women elected for the first time in American history in that class of 2018. One, Cherise Davis, still with us. The other, Deb Holland, is now the Interior Secretary. And so we're incredibly diverse as a caucus on race, on gender, on religion, on sexual orientation, on life experiences, on region and on ideology. But I think we lean into that dynamic and believe that it's what makes us the most authentic representatives of the American people because we broadly reflect in the widest possible way the diversity in every possible way of the American people. And that doesn't mean that we always agree. Sometimes we agree to disagree while trying to work to find common ground and arrive at the highest common denominator, which is always the driving objective. But for me, it's, I'd much rather be part of a, I'd much rather be part of a coalition than a cult. If you're part of a cult, and I'm not saying that, I'm not saying there's cult-like activity going on in Washington, D.C., you can draw that conclusion yourselves. But Senator Bob Corker, conservative Republican from Tennessee, during the early days of the previous president, said, this is turning into a cult. That's not Hakeem Jeffery's from the People's Republic of Brooklyn. that's Senator Bob Corker from Tennessee, Republican. I'd much rather be part of a coalition than a cult, but it's harder. Because if there's at least cult-like behavior, you just take orders from the cult leader. It's no matter how reckless, irresponsible, divorced from reality, dangerous. The orders are, the cult leader says it, you do it. Whereas in a coalition, you've got to work out these differences, including different ideological perspectives, the center, the center left, the left, you know, the furthest left. But all driven by the same values, what we like to say is fighting for the people, is what brings us all together to try to reach the highest common denominator. Yeah. Just sort of like following up from that, I mean, looking ahead to the 2020 election, 2022 election, sorry. Some political commentators have argued that the Republicans are going to win both the House and the Senate. Do you see the Democrats having any chance of victory? And if so, how so? If not, how do you think, how do you plan to operate as a political minority? And I think in the context of your last sort of response, do you think the sort of diversity of the diversity of the, Democratic side has something to do with that at all? Well, first of all, I have no plans to operate as a political minority because I think we're going to do everything possible. I know you had to ask the question, but we're going to do everything possible to make sure we hold the House and the Senate. Now, I understand the basis of your question because traditionally midterm elections in the Senate. in a president's first term, when that president's party controls the House, the Senate, and the presidency, I think the average loss of seats in the House is around 27. So mathematically, this is complicated. I mean, it's a complicated situation because right now we're sitting on 222 seats, which means we can only afford you know, to lose three seats or four seats and hold the majority. And there's some tough atmospherics as well. COVID fatigue, understandably, exists, you know, two years plus into it. People are done in many ways with COVID. Although COVID may not be done with us. Hopefully it is, but people are done with COVID, two years. in so there's a malaise and there's fatigue. And then, of course, the rising tide of inflation is impacting the pocketbooks of the American people. And that's a challenge as well. That said, I think there's a lot that President Biden has accomplished under his leadership, 6.6, I believe, million jobs created in Joe Biden's first year. That's more than any other president. in a first year in American history. Fastest rate of economic growth in 40 years. Unemployment at 3.94%. That's pre-pandemic low. We've had a situation where when President Biden first took office, two million Americans were fully vaccinated. One year later, more than 200 million Americans were fully vaccinated. Our infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. in Washington for decades, they'll tell you every other week was infrastructure week. Every other week and nothing ever happened. But under President Biden's leadership, we had a historic investment in our nation's infrastructure to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, tunnels, airports, mass transportation system, clean water in every community, universal access to broadband and high-speed internet, particularly important in the digital economy. those are just the highlights of his success, including a historic child tax credit that cut child poverty nearly in half during the last six months of 2021. So we have a record of accomplishment to run on. I think most would agree we have to distill it and do a better job of communicating that record of accomplishment to the American people, sympathize and empathize with the circumstance that people find themselves in, COVID fatigue, and inflation, articulate a vision for pulling us out of the final stretch of COVID, hopefully, and lowering costs for everyday Americans, and I believe we have a fighting chance to win. And the other side is a mess at this particular point in time, so we'll be able to draw a contrast as well. Yeah, well, you've kind of answered. like the question that I was going to follow up after that in terms of like the elections was whether it's to do with how the Democratic parties usually accused of sort of being too focused on social issues and not as much on sort of like economic issues. And I think in the accomplishments that you outlined, sort of you sort of shed light on some of the economic things that Joe Biden has worked on. The next thing that I wanted to ask, which is sort of moving towards the former president, recently Donald Trump and some of his children were recently subpoenaed by the New York Attorney General. Do you believe that Donald Trump committed criminal acts? And if so, would you support locking up Donald Trump? Well, I support making sure that we hold the former president accountable to the fullest extent of the law because in America, just like in the UK, no one is above the law. And that includes the President of the United States of America. Now, I have said on the record and believe it to be the case that during the previous four years under the prior president, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue was an ongoing crime scene. and certainly there were multiple impeachable offenses that he committed, one of which I participated in the trial to try to hold him accountable, and perhaps we can get into this, related to the events that we're seeing unfold right now in Ukraine. And then, of course, he told the big lie around the 2020 election and incited a violent insurrection and also may have tried to criminally alter the results in at least Georgia by pressuring the Secretary of State to find votes that didn't exist. And then there are a whole host of other financial improprieties that are being investigated. My advice has really been publicly, having spoken to these prosecutors, privately of course, but publicly, I just expect that they're gonna follow the facts, apply to law, be guided by the Constitution, and let the truth fall where it may. That's understandable. I'm just quite dubious of how, well, about the biases of a former president, versus an ordinary person. If it was someone else, I believe it would have been a lot more different. And I, well, I don't think personally that anything, this will yield to anything. But you mentioned the situation in Ukraine, and I think I just wanted to move on to that generally, which is very relevant in recent times. As we speak, Ukraine suffers the wrath of Russian invasion. Should the West, particularly the U.S., be blamed for not responding earlier? Well, I don't think that the West and the U.S. should be blamed, but I do think that we have to address Putin's aggression with increasing intensity. And we were talking a little bit about the former president. I'll just briefly say what was interesting about that initial impeachment trial is that our central charge was that the former president, engaged in a corrupt abuse of power by pressuring a foreign government, Ukraine, to target an American citizen, Joe Biden, in order to encourage them to dig up political dirt by threatening to withhold $390 million in military aid that had already been approved by the Congress and a bipartisan war. way, knowing that Ukraine desperately needed that aid, because Russia had already at that point invaded Crimea, had guns and malignant designs on doing further damage to Ukraine, which they now have done. So that was the first impeachment trial. And it's interesting how I think for many Americans now, it's a lot easier to understand why we endeavor to hold him accountable and why what he did was so problematic. It was geopolitical blackmail. And now we're seeing the basis of why he engaged in that blackmail. because he knew how much pressure Ukraine was under even at that point in time. Ukraine, an ally of ours, I think that it's important for us to stand up to a bully and an aggressor. But we have to stand up to him in a responsible way. so as not to trigger, I think as President Biden has indicated, World War III. So it's a difficult balance in part because some believe that Putin is reckless and unhinged. And at the same point, we can't allow him to run roughshard over a democracy in an independent country. I do think that making sure that the sanctions regime is the most onerous in world history is merited at this particular point in time. Maximum pressure on Putin. Some may say he doesn't care about the Russian people, but he does care about the oligarchs and his money. And that's why I think the strategic targeting of the oligarchs freezing their money, their assets, many of which are located in the West here in the UK and beyond, perhaps limiting the ability of Russia to participate in the international monetary system as best as possible. One of the things is being contemplated. Isolating them in the world are all things that should be on the table. And also making sure that there's a meaningful presence of American troops in the NATO-allied countries that are in that immediate neighborhood. All steps that I believe the administration has either taken or are contemplating taking in the next few days and next few weeks. Well, I think I would say that I sort of, the first thing that comes to mind is that when we speak about the oligarchs and freezing the rest of, I feel one would argue that it is perhaps difficult to connect those to the government for many reasons. And for that reason, it would be difficult to just go up to, well, go and just like freeze an oligalic sort of assets in the UK. But I think generally I want to say that we've seen that the economic sanctions do not actually deter Russia at all. They're going to continue whether they get more intense or not. Does the US intend to take any further sort of action? actions, any different actions to the economic sanctions, perhaps military action, or will it refrain from that? Well, let me just respond to your initial skepticism. This is, in fact, perhaps the world's greatest debating society. And I do think that, one, when the Soviet Union collapsed, you had all these state-owned assets. And there are many objective observers who believed that there was a corrupt bargain that was struck. State privatized these assets, fell into the hands of many oligarchs. Some, I'm sure, legitimately grew their wealth. Others, you know, inherited as part of a corrupt bargain that then financed the ruling elite in Russia, which now includes, and has for the last 20 years, Vladimir Putin. There's some who believe he's also Vladimir Putin, though he's a government employee, one of the wealthiest men in the world because of the corruption and the connection between him and his oligarchs. Even though he's not in private industry, how is he one of the wealthiest men in the world, possibly? So there's a lot of interconnectedness, and I think the U.S. has got, along with the West, intel and visibility into this web that exists between Putin, the oligarchs, and Russia. Just in the same way that we saw the United States and the West be able to basically declassify intel and say, we know he's saying he's not going to invade. We know he's saying he's drawing down troops and backing them away. He's doing the exact opposite. Make sure you get out of Ukraine if you're an American citizen because he's going to invade in the next few weeks, if not the next few days. And the U.S. was correct. And if they had that level of intel, the intel community, I think there's a lot of information that's known about the interconnectivity with the oligarchs, which is one of the reasons why you're seeing this maximum pressure effort. Whether it will work or not, of course remains to be seen, but I think it is the next most important step to take. I don't support the use of troops on the ground in Ukraine right now. I believe the president is correct to have refrained from taking that step in terms of escalation. But I think he's taking the next best step, which is to make sure that the American military presence in the region, in the neighborhood, Poland and beyond, is increased, and that we will continue to increase our military aid and assistance, direct military aid, including lethal weapons to Ukraine, now that they're in a hot war. One would say that perhaps providing weapons to the Ukrainian military is a sort of military involvement. But I, and a sort of, a sort of sneaky proxy war against Russia in that region. But do you, would you do not think that, well, firstly, that the American sort of like intervention in this, well, Americans, the US is seen as the guardian, like, you know, they, well, at least they portray themselves as the guardians of the world. And in this situation, the second we've seen are not working. I just want a snappy answer as best to whether what would be the next steps after the most intense economic sanctions that you have done and still it doesn't yield anything. Because if it is the case that these sanctions don't yield anything and they still occupy Ukraine, then that means we're just letting them take Ukraine. Is there anything planned? Well, I think, you know, well, I'll be back in the States in the next couple of days. I look forward to hearing what the president has to say both at the state of the union address, which he'll deliver on Tuesday. And I'm sure he's going to now dedicate a significant part of that speech to the war in Ukraine. So I don't want to get out of head ahead of any public pronouncements that he may put forward. But I do think we are going to have to address this issue with the intent. intensity of being, I wouldn't say the United States views itself as guardians, but I would say that you've got the free world and then you've got the authoritarian world. And at least in the context of the free world, you know, you've heard the United States be referred to or certainly our presidents as the leader of the free world. I think I would say first among equals, right? There's democracy right now and there's autocracy, and there is a responsibility. You know, as a robust democracy, I guess India would probably be the largest democracy in the world in terms of population, but as a robust, long-standing constitutional republic, century after century after century, there is a responsibility. And I think we're going to have to take that seriously, even though it's very dicey because of the dynamics around Russia run by an unhinged authoritarian who has nuclear weapons at his disposal. Yeah. I wanted to just, I was just wondering, what do you think this, you know, Ukraine invasion means for China's involvement in Taiwan? It's a great question, and I think it's one of the public policy questions that we all have to think through, because we believe that China is watching closely how the West, how America and the West, how the free world responds to this act of aggression by Putin and Russia in Ukraine. And of course, China's been very clear that they've got hegemonic demands or designs on Taiwan. And there's at least one school of thought that suggests, of course, if the United States and the West, the free world doesn't aggressively and decisively respond to Russia, China's much stronger. that may mean that they can proceed with a green light or at least a flashing yellow and take more aggressive steps as it relates to Taiwan. That's a legitimate concern. And something that I know policymakers back home in the states are thinking through in terms of wanting to get this right for the same. sake of the Ukrainian people, for the sake of the principles associated with democracy, and the premise of free and fair elections and government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and for the sake of what it means as it relates to sending the wrong signals to China. Yeah. I just wanted to sort of like, well, we've discussed Ukraine and got a lot of I don't think there is much that I can sort of acquire from our discussion unless President Biden has made much further announcements. And I think the addition of like sort of the consideration of Taiwan is very important in this because if it is the case that we just sort of let it happen, China will see it as a green light and they'll just move on. But also I just wanted to bring us back to the issue of Afghanistan, which has been sort of like forgotten about now that we have bigger, well, more recent problems. at hand. In August 2021, well, it was a dark, dark day for Afghanistan. After 20 years of war, the people of Afghanistan were led to Taliban mercy. Would you say withdrawing from Afghanistan was Biden's biggest mistake? No, I wouldn't call it Biden's biggest mistake, but I do think that and the American people, after 20 years, certainly supported a withdrawal from Afghanistan. Afghanistan because it couldn't be a perpetual endless conflict in war. I think the evacuation by and large with the tragic exception, of course, of the loss of military lives, any loss of life is tragic, military or civilian. but those were patriots who were there to do a job and died at the hands of a cowardly suicide bomber as part of doing that job not just to evacuate Americans but to evacuate Afghanis as well and I think the president has spoken to that pain of that moment with a sincerity and a heart that he brings to these type of tragedies because he's experienced human tragedy. I do think we have to continue to do everything possible to try to make sure that anyone who is under threat in Afghanistan from the Taliban can find safe harbor. Safe harbor in allied countries or safe harbor in the United States? And I do believe that that's a continuing responsibility that many of us in Congress believe the United States has to this day. Well, I think I may be too skeptical here, but I think that one would argue that after the U.S. forces sort of drove up, like, you know, drew back from Afghanistan, it hasn't been thought about at all. The people there have been left to the Taliban mercy. and for 20 years they were at war because of the US involvement of Afghanistan with Taliban. And after 20 years, the state is literally almost exactly the same as what it was 20 years ago. The US sort of interference there has made almost no difference, but in fact done a lot of harm over the years in terms of loss of lives. Now is it going to do anything in the future or at any point to sort of like, you know, prevent the human rights violations that are happening under Taliban governments? Well, I think I would, I wouldn't use the word U.S. interference in terms of our initial intervention, because I think our initial intervention was entirely justified. The Taliban gave safe harbor to al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, who, you know, who, you know, Rookle Down in history is one of the most brutal individuals ever to walk the face of the earth. Mastermind the plot where nearly 3,000 people were innocently killed on one day when the towers were struck, cold-hearted murder, mass murder, along with the Pentagon and the flight that went down in Pennsylvania. And dealing with the safe harbor that the Taliban were clearly provided. in Afghanistan to al-Qaeda was a necessary thing. I think mistakes were subsequently made, including making the decision to take your eye off the ball in Afghanistan, and based on a lie, go into Iraq, a war that I didn't support at the time, and I commend those who were in Congress. I was not in Congress at the time or in elected office, but commend those who understood that it was something to oppose. It was a tremendous mistake, and it continues to have consequences to this day because the fatigue that resulted amongst the American people from a failed war in Iraq that cost trillions of dollars, thousands of lives, tens of thousands of people, permanently maimed hundreds of thousands of lives lost in Iraq if not millions adversely impacted over more than a decade of illegitimate engagement that's a big mistake that can never happen again and I think as a a result of it, you have war fatigue now. It was an illegitimate conflict. But you have war fatigue, which limits the ability in the eyes of many authoritarians across the world for the current president or prior presidents to really legitimately threaten. Oh no, we're willing to send American troops into Ukraine. When they know the American people are still dealing with the trauma of that failed war. So that to me is the big foreign policy mistake that was made over the last 20 years, and we've got to learn the lessons of that. Thank you very much. I would like to now move on to some questions from the audience. If anyone has any questions, could I please ask that member? Yes, please. Thank you very much. Congressman Jeffries, it's pretty much an open secret inside and outside the beltway that you're being groomed to be Nancy Pelosi's successor. And I guess I want to ask you, like, how do you, how do you being under that microscope? How do you live with that? Because some of your critics, when you follow the U.S. media, is like, yeah, he's playing. He's always playing it safe. he's always fighting with the progressives but never in an overtly way so I guess yeah my question is like how do you navigate this incredibly like difficult role yeah I mean Nancy Pelosi has a hard time keeping this incredibly diverse not just in terms of like diverse in every regard this group together And yeah, sorry to be blunt, but that's why we're here. So thank you. I see you guys are starting with the easy questions first. I would. So, no, thank you for that question. One, you know, Nancy Pelosi is an amazing speaker. It's been such a great honor to be able to serve with her over the last nine plus years and then work with her as part of the House Democratic leadership team. a legendary figure in governance in America and really across the world. And she's still leading us forward on the battlefield where we're dealing with an incredible amount of issues. And so my view has really been none of us right now who are in the arena, in the Coliseum of American politics right now should be thinking about what may happen in the future. when we're battling, you know, for the American people right now, in the face of, you know, an intransigent opposition, Trump is gone, Trumpism is still with us. And it's not even clear right now in America whether everyone believes in democracy. And that was really brought into focus. On January 6th, during the violent insurrection and in its immediate aftermath, where my hope was that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would run toward democracy, many of them have run away from democracy and continue to embrace the big lie. So I think a lot of us in the generation of members of Congress who have been there for 10 years or less, really authentically are of the view that we're committed to holding the House. and that it would be irresponsible for any of us at this point to think about what may come next, what comes after November. We have to hold the house or we may not hold our democracy in the humble opinion of many of us. And that really, I think, is what keeps me focused on the moment. In terms of, and this question was asked earlier, part of what's been interesting about serving as chair of the House Democratic Caucus, it is an incredibly diverse caucus. Our diversity is a strength in my view, not a weakness, as I talked about earlier. And trying to find that common ground is something that I think is a day-to-day challenge, but one that I embrace because the framers of the Constitution were very clear. The House is supposed to be the institution closest to the people. That was their view of the House's role. It's the reason why all 435 of us stand for election at the same time every two years, unlike the President, four years, The Senate every six years, only a third at a time. Supreme Court, life tenure, the House, the institution designed to be the closest to the people to reflect, the hopes, the dreams, the passions, the concerns, the fears, the anxieties of the American people. And it's just an honor to be able to serve in this institution at this moment. And to be part of a caucus that I believe, you know, from the most, moderate and centrist to the most progressive and all points in between, does really strive to effectively represent the passions of the American people, their hopes, dreams, aspirations, fears, concerns, and anxieties. Thank you. Could I take a question from the ordinary member? Sorry. Thank you. I recognize that, as you've said, you're laser focused on holding the majority. in the November elections. But one doesn't climb as high and as successfully as you are without looking to the future. So if and when Nancy Pelosi does eventually retire, if you are the person who succeeds her, you have said that the Republican conference or implied that the Republican conference operates something like a cult and follows the leader. And yet they famously chew up and spit out their speakers. Look what happened to John Boehner. So, how does one keep control of a far more diverse caucus and successfully whip votes that doesn't have that same pressure from this strong man type figure? How does one fill those shoes? Well, I can talk about it from the perspective of sort of the moment that we're in right now. And we in the house we really don't have the luxury, I think of thinking about two, four, six years into the future. We're on two-year cycles. And they're on two-year cycles. And The Congress and the nature and makeup of the Congress really changes every two years for us. By design, right? By design. And, you know, and we lean into that. I think what keeps us together as a caucus is that I think what makes a House Democrat a House Democrat at the end of the day is that we fight for the people, three words. We fight for the people. That authentically captures at our best. best who we are. That every day when we wake up, we're trying to figure out how we can make life better for working families, middle class folks, those who aspire to be part of the middle class, senior citizens, young people, veterans, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, the least, the loss, and the left behind. That's us, House Democrats, at our best, from the most progressive member to the most centrist member. May not always agree on the means to achieve that result, but are all in 100% on that result that we fight for the people. So it's really the values that hold us together while embracing debate amongst ourselves to try to get to the best possible solution in public policy. Thank you. I recognize that now. You spoke about making the transition from corporate law to the State Assembly. I think many of us might soon be in a position where we feel like we have to play the game a little before doing something we're perhaps more passionate about. How did you keep that vision and how did you know when it was time to take the risk and make the leap? Yeah, you know, I think I very, Eventually wound up being in the private sector in terms of the practice of law. First started out at a law firm Paul Weisbriskin, Wharton, and Garrison in the litigation department. I initially thought that I was going to spend a little bit more time at the Department of Justice and wanted to work sort of in the Office of Civil Rights. graduated from law school in 97, clerked for a federal judge, largely from the beginning of 1998 into the early part of 1999, went back to the law firm, was planning on spending about a year or two there, learning the art and science of the law in the litigation department at Paul Weiss, widely recognized as one of the best in the world. And then perhaps making a transition at that point to the Department of Justice, particularly and hopefully in terms of my aspirations then within the Office of Civil Rights, which is headquartered at Maine Justice in Washington, D.C. As I was working through that potential path, something happened in November of 2000. that was unexpected, Al Gore lost the electoral college vote to George W. Bush. And I concluded at that point that that's not a Department of Justice in terms of the Office of Civil Rights that I wanted to work in, because I understood that they were not going to be actively enforcing civil rights laws. if anything, they were going to be engaging in benign neglect or outright undermining it. So then I changed course in terms of where I thought I might land. And it was at that point that I decided to pursue a seat in the New York State. Around that time, made the decision to pursue a seat in the New York State Assembly. I wound up doing that lost twice. And I remember losing the second time. And I was knocked down on the ground and I went back to the law firm. I remember saying, I'm in personal, political, and professional ruin. It was either my wife who's here with me today or my mother who said, stop being dramatic. And I had to realize, and I think this is an important life lesson, and I had to learn that it's important for all of you as you pursue your journeys, that you're going to inevitably confront adversity in life at some point. And almost anyone who's achieved any modicum of professional success, has at some point encountered adversity and failure. You often do not see it because you're just seeing whatever success they may have achieved at the point that they're currently at in their professional careers, but if you look back at it, you will inevitably find that they were knocked down on the ground. But the important lesson that I learned after those first two races was that a knockdown is different than a knockout. And while you can get knocked down, you need to have the strength and the resilience to pick yourself up off the ground, learn from your mistakes and those experiences, get back in the arena wherever it might be, and continue marching forward, dismiss the doubters, and continue marching forward toward your dream. That to me was an important lesson. I remember, you know, Corey Booker, United States Senator now, spent two years here at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar. So Corey has had an incredible amount of success throughout his life. It was a football star. He's a good friend of mine. Now, a football star. in New Jersey, went to Stanford, played football, at least for his first couple of years. Then was a Rhodes Scholar, then went to Yale Law School, then decided to move to Newark, ran for the city council, defeated, I think it was the 16-year incumbent at the time. Incumbent was a former boxer, was a street fighter, and said it's the road scholar versus the road scholar. And Corey was successful, which often doesn't happen. And they ran for mayor four years later, against another incumbent, lost that race in one of the highest profile municipal elections in the country at the time. And I remember someone saying to me, are you disappointed that Corey lost? I said, yeah, I'm disappointed, but I'm not devastated by it because I think this may actually be a good thing. And a person looked at me quizzically and said a good thing. Corby lost. You were supporting him. Believe that he's going to have an incredible future in American politics. I said, yeah, but look at his life. Nothing but success, every step of the way, including in his first race. But when you get into government, to your point, you're going to get punched in the gut often, have to face some tough decisions, be criticized, be vulnerable and exposed in a public way, and have to handle that. And I think it's an interesting thing to see, can Corey handle it? Adversity for the first time of his life, because now he's knocked down on the ground. Is he just going to be knocked down or is he going to be knocked down? I believe it's just going to be a knockdown, but let's find out. And four years later, he came back at one, and the rest is obviously history. And that's the case with almost anyone in any field of human endeavor who has achieved success. So embrace the adversity as you move forward. even if you make an initial decision to transition and it doesn't work out. The most important quality in achieving your dream, I believe, because you're all naturally talented and brilliant and hardworking. You wouldn't be here if that wasn't the case. It doesn't mean you're immune from adversity. Keep persevering and you'll achieve the success that you want to achieve and make a difference in this world. Thank you very much. I think that'll be it for questions for tonight. We really thank you a lot for coming today and having a very interesting discussion with us. It was also good to discuss some of the recent issues that have arised in Ukraine and the older ones, Afghanistan and all of those. And we're very grateful to you. So we'd like to thank Congressman Jeffries again for coming here. Thank you.
