 Let me begin by thanking the President and members of the Oxford Union for your kind invitation. A few days ago, I watched a YouTube clip of the singer James Blunt serenading this house. I'm no James Blunt, but for reasons I'll make clear shortly, I'd like to frame the case I want to make for tonight's proposition with a song. My country tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride, from every mountain side, Let freedom ring. Thank you. So, my first threshold point is a performative one, and it's quite personal. Quite personal indeed. You've just listened to the first stanza of the patriotic hymn, America, better known as my country, Tizavi. I like this song, and I like singing it. It's a song that every American of my generation, I'm 65, learned as a young school child, along with multiplication tables and the Pledge of Allegiance. Like Professor Kennedy, I was born, during the turbulent years of the civil rights movement. I was one of the little children whose future Martin Luther King dreamed about. In his celebrated oration at the 1963 March on Washington, I have a dream. Those of you who know that speech will remember that the incantation with which it ends, let freedom ring, is aligned from my country tis of thee. Aretha Franklin sang the song in 2009 at Barack Obama's historic first presidential inauguration ceremony. And President Obama used the lines of the hymn, the words of the I sing, as the title for 2010 children's book that he dedicated to his daughters. It's my personal American dream song. I imagine, though, that many of you heard yourselves silently singing the melody along with me, subconsciously, but with entirely different lyrics. My country Tizavi is what musicologists called a contrafactum, a composition that substitutes one set of lyrics for another without changing the music. Aromologically, the term derives from the Latin contra facere to counterfeit, which is a compound of the words contra, against, and facie to make do. My country tis of thee is an American ode to democratic freedom and popular sovereignty. God Save the King, which is what some of you heard, is a British anthem to the sovereign majesty of monarchical dominion. Both lyrics give voice to dreams of the imagined community, to use Benedict Anderson's phrase, that we call the nation. Now, some of you may have experienced the unfamiliar pairing of words and music as an acoustic disorientation, a dissonance that was not just cognitive, but corporeal, not just intellectual, but emotional, something you felt in your body, as though your ears were deceiving you to use the familiar figure of speech. If you did, you've experienced something of what I feel every time I sing, my country tis of thee. The dissonance I speak of, however, is not what you just felt, but something different. It involves the almost out-of-body distance I feel from my Americanness as a global citizen who is a proud member of the African diaspora when I sing this song. The feeling that comes from knowing that as much as I love to sing it, the words of the song you're singing, Kendall, about the fathers who've died, and the pilgrim's pride, and even the thee, were not written with you or your America in mind. Try as I might. I can never quite shake the sense that when I'm singing it, I'm singing somebody else's song. But I have learned or been taught to like the song. I told you, it's my dream song. So I set my ambivalence about the lyrics aside and sing the contra facto, which is riven with contradictions that we call my country tis of thee. The same mix of alienation and attraction also describes how I feel about the contrafactam we call the American dream, that complex of symbols, of stories, of myths, of images, of songs that suture not just American citizens, but citizens all over the globe to the idea of America. So, I want to move the case in favor of the proposition with another personal observation about the dream that explains why we find it so hard to silence, or at least to stop listening to its siren song, knowing as we do that the American dream, the song of America, has become an ideological weapon of death, as we've heard, not just in the United States, but all around the globe. The first is that there is no such thing as the American dream. I beg to differ. While the American dream may have become a global nightmare, its nightmare is one that the world doesn't seem quite ready to shake. Both in the U.S. and around the world, the power and puzzling persistence of the dream stem as much, stem precisely from the success with which the makers of the dream have continually marshaled the ideological arsenal that Umberto Eko calls the power of the fake. There is no American dream. So what does it mean to say that there's no American dream? This claim can be understood in at least one of two ways. First is as an argument about the assumed singularity implicit in the definite article. the American dream. There is no such thing as the American dream. It's an individual matter which penetrates the unconscious of everyone who claims it. It's the second more radical understanding of the claim, though, that I want to defend here, namely that the American dream simply does not exist. The ideological roots of the dream run deep in our national history, but many people are surprised to learn that the concept itself is not even a century old. The first recorded appearance of the phrase only dates back to James Truslow Adams' 1931 book, The Epic of America, in which he argues that the American dream is a dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement. If we accept this definition of the dream, the one thing that can be said about it, without fear of contradiction, is that it is manifestly a fiction, a fantastication, a lie that has not ever truly existed in all its fullness. It is, in other words, an impossible dream. This is especially true today when the we of Adam's social democratic narrative has given way to the me of neoliberal capitalism with its toxic mix of market fundamentalism and libertarian individualism. The U.S. is now the most unequal society in the developed world. Inequality in the U.S. is approaching levels last seen in the years leading up to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Now, one of the central themes of the dream historically has been its promise of social mobility. But as the economist Raj Chetty notes, the chance of ending up today where you start in America has gone up, where you start in America has gone up, while the chance of moving up has gone down. As the pandemic has wound down, the American press has been filled with articles with wistful titles such as the American dream of the middle class is not what it used to be, obituries for the American dream. In short, the U.S. today has far less mobility and equal opportunity than the EU or other OECD countries. In fact, the U.S. is 27th on the Global Social Mobility Index of the World Economic Forum, just above Spain and behind Lithuania. And so the question for me becomes, what explains the enduring power of the dream? globally, since we know that by any objective measure, the American dream no longer exists. We may say that it is dead even. The thing about dreams, though, is that they create their own reality. And this is the feature of the American dream that I want to suggest makes the proposition before the floor somewhat beside the point, even though I'm arguing it. It doesn't matter if the American dream is not real. It doesn't matter even that it has become a nightmare, domestically, as well as globally. We now live in the world described by the unnamed official in the George Bush administration in a now notorious article that appeared in the New York Times magazine in the fall of 2004. The author of that piece, Ron Suskin, quoted some words from his interview that by way of a conclusion, I'd like to paraphrase before I sit down. This Bush administration official said this. This is the dream today. We're an empire now. And when we act, we create reality. And while you're studying, or debating, the reality of whether the American dream has indeed become a global nightmare, or whether it's even real or true, will act again creating other new realities. The American dream has indeed become a global nightmare. Long live that American dream. Thank you. Thank you.
