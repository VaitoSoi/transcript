 To close tonight's debate and indeed close the case for the opposition, it brings me a great pleasure to invite on. Laws of them from Lady Margaret Hall, Augustine Chan. this historic chamber and it is a great honor to close the debate for the opposition. Tonight, we have heard from the proposition telling us that borders are essentially evils. Whoever upholds the concept of borders will suddenly become a morally bad person who supports inequality, oppression and exploitation. The proposition has presented to us a utopian fantasy that by abolishing borders, the world will suddenly become in heaven where problems we are currently facing will automatically vanish. Problems that proposition identified today are not actually attacking the foundation of borders, but are merely demanding adjustment on relevant government policies. By removing borders, we are also removing the concept of states and citizenship. We can have a more open borders, but it cannot be abolished. Remember, the proposition's duty tonight is not to present to you that we have only present to you that we are facing a lot of problems in the world and how current substantive border settings are inadequate in solving these problems, but they must explain how an ordinary and functioning world can be maintained without borders. So three substantive points in my speech today. Firstly, borders exist naturally that even if we take away a structure, the form of border will eventually return. A more structured border system is better because it minimised conflict. Secondly, the border serve an instrumental function that ensures laws and policies are implemented democratically and efficiently. Thirdly, there are some form of border control is reasonable and necessary. My first point is that natural humanities that makes borders comes into existence. Even if we abolish borders, they will nevertheless return in this form. So all animals have some form of division of territories even without the concept of borders. Imagine there are various groups of chimpanzees that are spread across a fields of land comfortably and their boundaries are not touching each other. As times go on, each group will have new baby chimpanzees, and those baby chimpanzees will give birth to further championses. Expansion of land is soon needed to ensure all babies have sufficient space. At the moment, no conflict arise because groups of champions can expand their boundaries without interfering other groups. However, we will reach a stage where boundaries are touching each other, so borders will therefore arise. A study in Uganda found that championses expand their territories by attacking and killing neighbors. Gangs of chimpanzees carry out violent attacks on individuals from viral groups to secure more resources or mates. So in this example, we can see that invisible borders naturally arise through expansion of territories. Conflict will arise even there is not a structure of borders. So human evolution also originated from trials where we live in groups with similar heritage. We continue to have this concept under the notion of citizenship. Even if we abolish borders, human will still form different consequences. communities, self-protection and orders. Terrorist group or territories will still exist and it is natural for humans in groups to defend themselves. So given that the form of border will nevertheless exist, the benefit of having borders for a nation-state structure is that territory conflicts may first be resolved by political dialogue or democratic mandate. For example, the Treaty of St. Petersburg between Japan and Russia, where Japan agreed to give up its claim on an island in exchange for an undisputed ownership of an other island. Or the Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that the Northern Ireland can form part of the United Ireland with a majority of vote. Borders very often offer a concrete line for countries to obey and they are there to make the world in peace by avoiding any confusion on boundaries. Countries are expected to use their methods to solve an overcrowded environment, for example making greater land utilisation through redevelopment. So if we abolish borders right now, the mechanism for peace talks and negotiation is diminished because of the lack of boundary lines. It is very much a free-flowing world that communities hoping to expand may go around different places to search for ones that they can take advantage of. Then we are getting into a call-of-duty free-for-all arena in which communities in power fight over different areas of land. So my second point is that borders serve as an instrumental function for all social order and democracy. Within the country's boundary, we have governments, courts, laws which claim authority over citizens within the boundary. The idea that the world can continue to function orderly without borders presuppose that there is a world central government that can offer similar bodies and similar effects. And I argue that it's impossible and there are two reasons in supporting my claim. Firstly, it fails to ensure that laws are enforceable and able to reflect the culture in a particular region. Having specific law within one's community in a borderless world is unenforceable because the person can leave the community without any restriction. The only option is to create a world police that enforce the same rules against everyone in the world. The law can therefore no longer reflect specific groups of people's ideology and culture, ranging from death penalty to as minor as eating chewing gum, which is banned in Singapore, is impossible to provide a set of law that satisfactorily reflects the existing nations' consensus and beliefs. This leads to the second concern, the lack of democracy and administrative efficiency. I argue that the nation state is the absolute largest territories, within which democracy can exist. No leader can be elected to speak for the world's people. The party system and nations presents us with a spectrum of political ideologies, ranging from left to right and authoritarian to libertarian. I'm not saying that any electrical system is perfect because there is not one, but I argue that the Conservative, the Labour and Liberal Democratic parties in the UK can at least provide some meaningful way for people to choose representatives that reflects closely to their ideologies. In a borderless world with hundreds of community of leaders and region occupiers, there can be no devolutions like the Oxford City Council from the Westminster to provide public service for a region, because the central world government does not know who to give the resource and money to. Regional borders in a borderless world also have no duty to support people who do not like them because they can just say that person is kicked out of that community. So some people will be left out as truly individuals that they do not belong to any communities. It is then difficult to see how the world central government can find all these individuals and offer them to help they need them. Moving on to my final argument tonight is that some form of border control is necessary and reasonable. We do not oppose the concept of immigration. Indeed, lots of research have proven that immigration is good for both the hosting and sending countries. But countries have and countries also have a humanitarian duty to those who unfortunately suffer from war or political oppression. However, this cannot be said that we must open our arms to the world unconditionally and abolishing borders absolutely. Even if we put the issue of law and all that I mention aside, it is still practically infeasible for regions to take on an extensive transformation of people over such a short period of time, while continue to provide adequate public service such as schooling, housing and healthcare. Some may argue that the EU is a good example to show what abolishment of borders is possible and appears that we have freedom of movement and a relatively successful economy. But then why not we extend that to the world down? But this argument has failed to recognise that internal borders, EU countries still exist. Domestic law differ between members of dates and EU law actually gives a marginal appreciation to the difference in culture between states on human rights issues. More importantly, an open border system in the EU does not mean an absence of border. The EU actually permits internal border control in certain circumstances. For example, France currently has internal border control until October 22 under reasons of COVID-19, continuous terrorist threat and secondary movement. Norway, Germany, Sweden and many more EU countries have similar internal border control currently as well. Therefore, border control is reasonable and necessary in stopping the transmission of disease, national safety and avoidance of an unexpected number of people entering the region that it cannot hold. In closing my speech for tonight, I encourage you to think of the following. The law creates a border that prevents someone from entering my house about my permission. What the proposition today has told us is that because of social justice and general humanity, you should get rid of your front door, your kitchen door, your bedroom door, even the outer break wall, opening your arms to an unlimited amount of people into your house. We'll not be better to say that borders do exist and I can invite a suitable number of guests into my house so that I can ensure all of my guests and my existing family members are treated with great care. For the people who are outside of my house, I can invite, I'm there are other means to help them. A nation is just like an extended version of a home. The ways to solve immigration inequality issues is not through an abolishment of borders, which will lead us to a state of chaos, legally and practically. It is more to do with immigration policies, collaboration between countries and foreign aid, which applies to the same effect as the people outside the house that we have other means to do so rather than abolishment of borders. So ladies and gentlemen, for an orderly and functioning society, I urge you to oppose a motion tonight. Thank you.
