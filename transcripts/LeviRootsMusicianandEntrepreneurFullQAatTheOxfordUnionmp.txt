 Thank you so much for coming through Mr. Thank you so much for coming through Mr. Roots. It's a great pleasure to host you. How you feel? I'm good thank you. I'm really good. It's fantastic to be in a place like this. It really takes me back how much I wanted to learn when I was a kid because I grew up not ever been going into any school whatsoever until I was at age of nearly 12. So it was really difficult for me, but something inside me felt like I wanted to learn if I could have the opportunity. So coming here and going into the library and seeing this bastion of learning, it's just really encouraging for myself. for myself is really great. That's amazing. We're going to go into a lot of themes tonight. But before we start, I understand you have a couple of submissions to make before the interview begins. Yeah, absolutely. I think the most important thing why I'm here really, and the reasons why I brought my guitar with me, is because I think music and food has been that sort of way for me going forward. And if I didn't bring the guitar, then I wouldn't be the really Levi roots that's coming to have a chat with you about honesty and about all this kind of stuff. I really believe it wasn't for this guitar, I wouldn't be here now. It doesn't matter how fantastic the source was and no matter how much the dragons had invested in me, how many dragons had invested. If it wasn't for something as personal as music that I brought with me, I think I would have been one of those losing ones that you see on the den that goes in. You know, does a little bit okay, but nobody ever remembers him after that. And I think the memory is about the song. And music has always been in the blood of me. So if you're going to talk to me at all about my life, it has to surround about music. And music for me is about these three simple chords that I wrote. And it's made me one of the most famous black man in the country that doesn't kick a ball or run fast. And it's just this little simple song. So I'll just start with that and then we can go into them. Somebody put some music in the food for me. food for me give me some reggae reggae sauce at reggae reggae sauce it's so nice I had to name it twice I call it reggae reggae sauce at reggae regisos just like my baby it is the perfect delight it's got some peppers and some herbs and some herbs and spice we want some reggae reggae sauce at reggae rakey sauce so nice with your fried chicken make burgers finger lickin and your barbecue and your drumsticks put some reggae reggae sauce on your dish so nice with fish and chicks and in a vegetarian dish as a marinate or as a dip love reggae reggae sauce nice Your cheese rigi-rigi sauce, at rigi-rigi sauce. It's so nice, I had to name it twice. I call it rigi-rigi-rigi-sauce, at rigi-rigi-sauce. Yeah. Yeah. the power of being yourself. Because I suppose if I did leave the guitar at home, like many people had said to me before, I went on the show, you know, people said to me, leave I, don't take that bloody guitar, whatever you do, nobody's ever sung on the show before. But I, I wanted to be me. I didn't want to pretend. I didn't want to go to the Dragons Den without being the best of me, something that I've reaped on for half my life, when I realized that I was going the wrong way and the best of me is when I have this in my hand so to go to the day no matter how much the sauce was fantastic and I've been selling it and sold loads and thousands of bottles but going there I didn't want the investment in the sauce I wanted the investment in Levi-Rourdes and that's why I went with the best of me which involved the music that's incredible I think that's a very important thing you talked to have been authentic and being true to yourself But of course, the industries you, you know, traversed and succeeded in are ones which have tremendous external pressures and traditional ways of working. How have you managed to still be yourself, especially in the boardrooms when you're negotiating what prices or how people are going to invest in your business? How do you maintain that throughout your career? Yeah. I do think honesty have a lot to do with it. I think when you go through the quagmire of lying to yourself, of pretending that you you are the finished product, but you're not. But then when you do work hard and you overcome all that, it becomes easy to be you and you relish and you love that. I love me now. I didn't love me before. You know, the Levi roots of many years ago, pre-Dragon's den and with my music times and the struggles of that, it wasn't one, not even I would have invested in my own self. If I saw me or the TV struggle, I wouldn't have invested because I, I know that wouldn't have been the real mean. But that realization of that honesty of saying that you're not good enough. Because I only got to my part with the Dragons End and the music when I recognized to myself that perhaps the music on its own wasn't good enough. Perhaps I wasn't good enough as a singer and as a musician. And that was a very difficult one to go through. Because I'd gone through 25 years or so with the music and had seven kids at the time before I got to do. dragons then and the music didn't really bring me what I really wanted which was to buy my kids the kind of toys and the trainers and stuff that all the other friends had in Dulwich where we lived at the time and and and that honesty of admitting to my own self that perhaps I needed to have a plan B you know and and the plan A of the music which is a dangerous thing when you're in a comfort zone or something like music because you never want to get out of it because it's so enjoyable you know a life of singing and writing songs in a period and stage. There's nothing boring or bad about that. But it's the comfort zone that you get stuck and you don't realize that it's not working for you. But the bravest of people are the ones who can recognize that, you know, and manage to pull themselves out of it. Or, like in my instance, it's not me that pull myself out of it. It's somebody else that spotted that I was struggling and managed to help to pull me out. Because if it was up to me, I would be still there like strumming the guitar and hoping that the day will come one day when I have. upon you know one of these big MTV programs which never came but it was that honesty of saying that maybe you need to change and I merged the music and the food together and that was the massive success for me really I think you've preempted one of my questions which is going to be can you think of a pivotal moment in your life of importance yes it's propelled you to where you are today absolutely and I can think of that moment it was the rejection that you get if your own people reject you because I originally thought great, you know, I had my grandmother's sauce when the music didn't work. So I started to produce the sauce and I thought that I live in Brixton, a nice community here where everyone is Caribbean and I'm doing a Caribbean sauce. So I thought, fantastic, this is going to be brilliant. You know, I'm going to have a ready-made customer in front of myself, you know, in my own town. And actually, the whole thing bombed. Nobody brought the sauce. As a matter of fact, people were laughing at me. They were saying that, you know, Levi, sell us your music because we like you for that. You know, we know you for your music but please don't sell us a bloody sauce because we everyone can make their own sauce everyone's Caribbean in Brixton so it was that rejection again from your own local people that were telling you that whatever you're trying to sell us that's not good enough go and work and I actually thought that I had a right to that market but in real terms no one has a right to a market you have to go out and find your market it doesn't necessarily mean that is the people and that's on your doorstep and I I realized that when I got rejected there and I knew that the sauce was good because I had sold it at the carnival for many years but that was just once a year. So I knew that there was a mainstream market that loved the way I was putting the music and the food together at the carnival every year. They would see me and my children and I would have done and I would be singing the song and normally when I got to that verse about jerk chicken and all, everybody laughs and it's a great fun. But it was only once a year that it wasn't enough to inspire me to put the music down, music down completely. But at the time when you know that energy comes and you realize that this is something about you then you have to make that step. So I've always enjoyed being me ever since that day and it was that catalyst of having to find my market and I went into somewhere what I call the Shires. We decided to go to anywhere in the UK that had Shire at the end of it. Because we thought in the family as our kids then you know we thought that no black man with no dreadlocks like me, it's not going to be jumping out at you with no guitar about Reggie Reji Sauce. Perhaps people in the Shire's couldn't even pronounce reggae at the time. It was that remote in these places that I was thinking of going. And we went to places like Carmarthenshire and some really way out places that in these lovely country fate markets, that there's no black Rastaman and nothing called Reggae Reggae, nothing reggae at all. But yet I would be there with my guitar singing the Reggae Reggae Sauce song, and having the whole crowd in these lovely farmers markets in these Shire countries. And that's where I found out that actually business doesn't belong to anyone. Anyone can be successful in business, but you'd need to find your own niche of your market so you can control that market. And I was bringing Caribbean food to the Shires, something new to them. And I could tell the story as well. So it wasn't just about the source now in the Shires. It was actually about the story of a rastas. of a Jamaican, of the music of reggae, of the whole Bob Marley story of Rastafara and rebelism and all that kind of stuff. All this was popped into the bottle and on the label and you had a person that was actually singing songs about his grandma and talking about where the source was from and the Shias absolutely loved it and that's where my market was. Oh wow, that's incredible. You pointed a, I guess I proved to issue within certain communities about feeling rejected. And it's not a mystery that you're probably the biggest Afro-Caribbean cuisine brand label across the UK right now. What obstacles do you think people from your people who are pursuing a career in cuisine are facing when it comes to trying to promote Afro-Caribbean food in a much more prevalent industrial level than just normal corner shops and so on. Yeah, it's a really brilliant point that you might do because I know it's prevalent amongst people is that doubt that you have in yourself. And as I mentioned before, I had those doubts, you know. But again, when I said when I dug into myself and found that I was good at something and I'm good at being me and I enjoyed being me. It is an experience that I went on to do that, to actually find the real me that I, I could actually enjoy. And when I'm in the shires amongst the people that weren't from my background, I actually felt quite comfortable there. Because I was enjoying the fact that this new mean that I found wasn't something that I was ashamed of for anything. I could actually do things that other people couldn't do. For instance, I had my musical ability. And I had this cooking thing that I felt very comfortable in the kitchen to be able to do that. And I knew that not many people would have these kind of attributes, whether you're white, black, pink or brown. If you're lucky enough to be blessed with any type of music, it puts you above others because you become a conductor of people. Because that's what somebody on a stage does. Whoever the audience is, that person is conducting that movement of that person. So I felt very powerful in that respect because of my musical background. So when I went into the shires, it wasn't just somebody that was coming with a source and with an idea to sell sources to a lot of people. It was a performer that was now putting his performances, experiences, to a product. And when he's actually selling a bottle of sauce for one time 50, I'm actually performing that sales to the customer. And hoping that the customer doesn't just buy the sauce. They invest in the sauce. Because investment is when they come back again. And we found that people in the Shire just calling us up to come back for more sources. because the character of the sauce and the food, they were actually loving that. Somebody was bringing it alive. It wasn't that like Mr. Hines. You know, you give a bottle of sauce and nobody knows who Mr. Hines is. There's no character you eat it or you love it or you don't love it. But in this instance, when I was coming around, it was literally a person that was coming, telling you his stories of where the sauce is from. Jerk sauce wasn't around in the shires at the time, and I was coming with this news of what was jerk food and what was jerked. chicken and I was talking about scotch bonnet chilies and old spice and all that kind of stuff that was in jerk. So these people felt that they were actually getting a story from me and I relished the fact that after failures of my local, I'd found a set of people that was actually loving what I was doing. So it gave me that confidence that, yeah, being you is fine. Being you is okay to express you as what you are. That's amazing. I understand you live back in Brickson at present time and what lessons have you taken from discovering who you are back to the community and those who perhaps might have doubted or rejected you in the past? Well that's got to be about being grounded isn't it because even from rejection you've got to take something from that you've got to accept something otherwise you're going to lose out on that inspiration and the inspiration for me was people We're not saying that we don't like you, Levi Roots. They were saying that we just don't like the product that you're trying to sell us. So for me, it was still staying around of my locality, because I still live in Brixton now, which a lot of people find surprising. They think I should have moved to North London or so. As well, a lot of people, as soon as you make a bit of money, you move out from your local here, and the next thing you're living it up in North London somewhere. But I always thought that that rejection was a very valuable thing for me. me to learn from and I thought that there is a lot of Levi Rootsies around my community because I see them every day are the potential ones who don't get a chance to will ever get a chance to see a Peter Jones you know walking through Brixton or are any one of these great people that I've met in my time in business these youth will never get to see them and I thought it was important for me to be around you know so they can actually see me so so even though the The attraction of moving out has been really attractive to me at all times. But I think this thing of keeping grounded of having a reason to still be the Levi that people are invested in, because they're never invested in a guy that was living in Amsterdam or anywhere. They invested in a guy that was living on Railton Road in Brixton on the front line, and his expression of the source and everything was part of his upbringing. Because you can't forget that. I really do believe that that hustling attitude of me running around Brixton and, you know, breaking into houses when I was a kid and all that kind of stuff is still a makeup of who you are now. So I knew that there were other kids there that needed that attention. So I just thought that I've got to be there. And now when I walk around Brickson, and Brickson has changed so much. It's become gentrified now, you know, it's absolutely amazing. And I'm still one of the most, you know, famous guys or perhaps one of the old guards that are still around there. are still around there and still going to Letchukhavin you and do my shopping and do all that kind of stuff from Brickston Market that I always have. But to answer your question there is that I think the community has kept me grounded. It really has that you don't forget who you are and you still think that you have a job to do. You have a job to do there. Yeah, that's amazing. I think it's incredible that you're using your community as a source for being grounded, but also it seems you describe yourself as some form of paternal figure for many people there who might lack inspiration and i know that you just talked about how your upbringing is shaped who you are today and know in the past you talked about um the difficult relationships that you've had with your father i wonder whether you'd like to comment on how that's affected your career trajectory today but more importantly what role you think that has done in shaping the incredible successful man you are yeah no absolutely i think i i don't normally like to talk about my father. I think since it's been a long time I haven't talked about him. I think the only time at the time I spoke openly about him was on a Desert Island disc where Kirstie opened me up as she always does and she's a great interviewer because I normally always try and sly away from that sort of stuff but now that I have brought it out in the open about that terrible relationship that I had with him it would be it would be brilliant to had what I actually took out of that because I have just said you have to take the good out of the bad as well. So I spoke to my mom actually, you know, after all Dragon's Day and 15 years of Dragon Slaying and the sauce, out selling an end tomato ketchup and as I said, massive. So I asked my mom, I said to her mom, where do I get it from? You know, how do, where have I come from of being this person that I couldn't spell my first name at the age of 12? I struggled immensely, I couldn't talk, I, math, as you saw in Dragons Zen, as you guys you probably saw numbers just upside. I don't get numbers at all. And that was from a very, from I was very young. I never knew that I was dyslexic, because when I was in school in those days, dyslexia wasn't something that was quite known. So he was either seen as dance, or you were stupid in some sort of way. So I grew up with my father's, you know, sounds ringing in my ears that you're dancing, you're stupid. And at the age of 13, I'm just reading my first Enid Blighton book and only get into one. one or two pages. And so I spoke to my mom after the sort of dragon's the end thing. And I said to her mom, where do I get it from? Because I've never spoken to my father in any way. I've never gotten into his car. I was the youngest of his six children. But yet, in some ways, I got the worst treatment. So I asked her, I said to her mom, how, have all the family, why is it mean that's been blessed with? Nobody out of the family has ever done anything as fantastic of what I've done, even with the music from the early days. So I asked that, where do I get it from? And she says, you get it from your dad. And when she said that, for the first time, I found some respect for him because I didn't understand how I got to where I am now and managed to surpass a lot of my friends that were doing much better than me in school that had gone to primary school and everything else. And yeah, she said that you get it from your dad and she started to explain what he was like. And now I draw strength from it. I haven't spoken to him since I was 17. But I do draw strength from the fact that he was someone like me in some sort of way. I don't think about him too often. But I know that whatever makes me tick is something fantastic that I love. So it must be coming from a good place. So he must have some sort of goodness in him. That's incredible. and thank you so much for sharing that very personal story with us. As we began before you played, you noticed in your opening remark how institutions like this is something that you would never, when you were younger, envision yourself as someone who'd be speaking here or be part of it, but it seems there was a desire in you to pursue some form of education. Now that you've perhaps been diagnosed or know more about your knowing difficulties, in different ways. Is there any plans for you or any thoughts for you to maybe take up academia? Yeah, well, you know, I think where it lies for me is after I got famous, I realized that how much young people were buying the sauce, and it was them that was keeping the Leroy Root's name. Because of that, you know, that thought of seeing a guy with a guitar and a show about business and enterprise, and I'm sure everybody when I first came and thinking that he's going to lose. I mean even I when I look back at this myself I think that bloody hell what am I doing that trying to until you know you've overcome that but it was young people that thought that it was a cool I was a bit cool doing that and got the investment in slain dragons and ever since that day I thought that I want to give I want to give everything back to young people I want to give the inspiration back so I started my School of Life tour just a year after Dragons then and that's been going for 15 years where I just thought I want to go to every school in the UK. Wherever they're young people, that's where I want to be. Prisons, colleges, universities. I've done nearly as much prison in this country as there is hundreds of prisons I've been back into, spoken in hundreds of schools and universities and that just by going back and giving that immortal story that if I can do it, you know, after telling them where I'm coming from, you know, and I get the odd letter, you know, I get, well, I get lots of visitations every year but I do get the hard letter when somebody writes back and tell me where they've heard me speak you know as a young people and tell me how their business have this set their business up by watching Dragonsden and hearing and hearing my struggles then for me it's job done you know so really to answer your question I just want to give back the story I just want to try and save a few other kids like me that are out there and I don't have the greatest thing I have is this story it is this story of always overcoming my own frailties. And if I can tell that story and that can help other people to come over their own frailties, then for me that's the purpose, why I got this fame and everything in the first place. Oh, thank you. And overcoming frailties, a common question that is asked of people in the UK, especially successful, black men in the UK, is navigating a world whereby there are either some form of micro-regressions or something of systemic either unintentional overt intentional racism. In your experience, has that been an issue in if so, have you sort of overcome it? For me personally, it's a difficult one because I really try not to see it. You know, I think that's the best way I've learned how to be the new me because I learned the me that I had to completely not be the person that I was before. And part of that was disregarding a lot of the stuff that would have made me angry when I was younger. Because I came to this country in the 70s and that was a time of the sauce laws and skinheads and that were running around the place. And one had I would come out of school and there was a load of skinheads that would love me and want to know about reggae music and scar music and the mods and all that kind of stuff. They love the black kids and they love the Jamaican patwa. So that's on my left. But when I turn on my right, there's another load of skinheads. that want to rip my bloody head off because these were not the fashion skinheads, you know, these were the fashion skin that love the fashion, these were the fascist ones. So they, I had to bloody, you know, literally run away from them because I live in South London and a lot of skinners were in Norwood at the time, so we would meet in the middle. So, so I got to learn how to decipher the two and be really sensible about it and try not to make these things be a part of my things. thinking of this new me to overcome all these other things. So I've always tried not to notice these things, not saying that they don't happen, because the most dangerous ones are the ones that you don't see. Because they are the one that maybe have stopped me. When I am, you know, I used to try to get the investment before I got on Dragonston and try to, you know, to do it the normal way of trying to, you know, go into a bank and trying to get investment. But I suppose you come out thinking that you didn't get it because you said something wrong or because your plan wasn't right. But it's a good thing I didn't see the racism because that would have got me angry. And I think that would have set me back. So I've always tried to close my eyes off of it. But if it confronts you, obviously, you know, you've got to deal with it. But I never really got that. And that's being honest. I know it's there, but I try not to see it as much as I can. Because if I see it, I get angry and then it gets worse. That's amazing. On a much more fun question note, you've produced reggae reggae sauce, reggae cookbook. Looking at you today, if you don't mind me saying, you're quite the fashionable man yourself. A lot of mercy. I'm just wondering what's the next venture. Is it going to be reggae reggae rings? That's really cool. I get that all the time and I think because the brand is the most important thing. You know, it's not about the sauce. I think when you mentioned Peter Jones earlier, one of the first things that I said to Peter after Dragons Den is that moment when you invest and you'll see they come over and hug the investment. And I said to him, could we have a chat afterwards and we had a chat out the back, you know, just after filming. And one of the first thing that I said to him is how shall I play this? Meaning that now you've put your name towards my thing now. Am I going to have to change? Do I, you know, sort of change the way I talk, dress, whatever. And Peter said, no, be you. Be exactly who you are. He never invested in the sauce. He invested in Levi roots. So that gives me now the freedom to be this new me and to be happy about it. So that relationship is just grown on and on. And one thing that we did notice that, you know, it's not about the source. It is about Levi. And with that comes the integrity as well too. Because the source is the colors of Rastafara. It's green, golden, red. You know, it's called reggae, which is a Jamaican heritage. You know, it's got a dancing Rastaman on it. Everything is about integrity there. You can't fool around with that. And as a Rastaman, there are certain things you have to observe. And if you're selling something to the public and you're telling them that there's integrity involves in that, in that, then you really have to be true to who you are. So I won't be able to do the Levi-Roothings, bling, bling, range because, you know, we can't stamp anything just on anything. It has to be Caribbean. And if it doesn't resonate with who I am as a person, then we can't do it. One of the things I get all the time is to do pork. You know, I get massive opportunities over the years to earn a lot of money from a pork ribbon, pork this and pork that. But as a Rastaman, I wouldn't be able to do that. And that's part of the integrity that you have to bear. It's a bit of a cross still. But it stops you from indulging in anything. I refuse so many TV shows. I mean, some fantastic TV opportunities has come my way. Really brilliant. I mean, you're talking about the top shows. But again, there, I have a responsibility for who I am and not just to do anything that would make me laugh and make people buy the source today. And then in five years' time, I look back and think, oh, fucking hell, I shouldn't have done that thing. So I'm always very careful in stamping the name and anything. It has to be Caribbean. to represent it in what I want to do and not just because I want to make some money. So I'm guessing we won't be seeing you on the next episode of Love Island or anything like that. No, no. These are the programs that said I've responded. You know, I've legendary turned down strictly come dancing twice. I know guys, I know, you guys get that. But again it was about that sort of stuff. You've just got to be very careful that you do not regret these things and I actually relish turning down. some of these programs because I'm glad that they're still offering them to me and I think you know as a as a 64 year old raster man you know it's really I'm complimenting to know that I'm still being taught about in that way and being offered on these type TV shows and all that kind of stuff so I love that fact but it doesn't mean that you know I say yes to everything I'm very careful in what I choose to do that's incredible I think authenticity and being you is being a core to who you are today probably explains why you're so successful. But also that supervenes on your identity is a rasterfarian. And from what I understand, you weren't always, I think you grew up in a Christian household. Could you explain to us what Afrofarianism is, but also more importantly what it means to you and who you are today? Yeah. Well, it was a struggle growing up, as, you know, not being able to read and write at that age. Most things troubled me. You know, my name troubled me. My father had given me the name of a Scottish gentleman and the God of Love in Keith, Valentine, Graham. And by the time I got to 14 and I started to listen to reggae and Bob Marley. And now I started to speak better. I could read a little bit better because my mom was teaching me. And then you started to wonder about your name because all the stuff was coming from America about the civil rights movement. And black people were starting to get to know themselves now and started to raise up. But here in the UK, there was no such thing as civil rights. And when you were in school, no black history month or whatever. So you felt kind of lost who you are. So I looked up the name Keith Graham just to see where it was from. And I found that it was a bloody Scottish name. And I just kept looking in the mirror and thinking, I don't look fucking Scottish. You know what I mean? Something is wrong here, you know? How did I end up with that? And you get to learn that 90% of Jamaicans have Scottish names because of the slavery and that. and that sort of stuff, that we end up with these kind of browns and Grimes and that sort of stuff. So because the music was not becoming something that I wanted to do, I just couldn't feel the name Keith, no matter how much I said it, you know, in a way, I just couldn't feel it somebody introducing me on stages, bloody Keith. So again, listening to reggae and I found Rastafari, which Bob Marley was a famous 12 tribe member of Rastafari. And Rastafari was now saying that, your name is the month of the year that you were born. And it comes from the 12 sons of Jacob. And so the month of June is Levi. It represents the tribe of Levi. So I chose the name Levi because I wanted to feel better about my... It sounded better to introduce me at stages, Levi. And Roots is just really saying that, you know, the strongest part of the tree and I wanted to feel that I'm strong. So I started to use the name before I left school and I recorded my first song just after school. It was a track called Poor Man Story that was telling the life of of myself when I left school and having no job on your under dole in Brixton and getting arrested all the time and and I'd gone to prison. By the time I was 17, I'd already had three months in prison. So that song was just telling that the life and the struggles and that what it was as Levi Roots and not as Keith Graham. So again that thing about finding yourself was still in me from that very early age, finding the name, because you are, I think your name should resonate who you are in some sort. I feel so anyway. And so I didn't really feel comfortable to, maybe to express myself as a Keith. And I think the change into Levi, I relished that change. I felt, you know, I felt like a performer and I felt that name really was me. So it ends me changing that name. And the first thing that had to do was get Keith out of him. get Keith out of here. What's he doing around here? And I'm bringing Levi. Oh wow. That's really interested. Your relationship is sort of like growing from relationships with obviously your mom and with reggae reggae source. I understand that was born off through relationship with your grandmother and the relationship you have with her through cooking. You're also wondering if there's anyone else who you think is served as inspiration towards other parts of your life and how they've done so well i've got to mention the latter part of my life it doesn't be many people that has helped me back then but i think since the famous come it's been a different it's a different thing it's a different struggle and and if you don't have that and not many people have that you know and it's one that's very difficult to explain that you are struggling when your name is being you know on everyone's lip and lips and all that kind of stuff but I did struggle and it was it was my son he's nine now and I think when when he came along it was a it was a turning point of my life that I actually got sued by a friend of mine and was one of the biggest cases in this country in in that time big sued big time you know for 30 million quid was the numbers that the Daily Mail was pushing around and and every friend that I knew was now coming out and saying what a terrible person I was and everyone that I ever smoked a spliff with was now telling telling that I did that every girlfriend was now in the newspaper chatting about me and it really was the most difficult part of my life and I hated the fame I wanted to give it back you know I wanted to give everything back and just go back to the person back to the music and forget about everything else that came with that. And then I met my current partner and then we had our current son, Christopher. And for then my whole life changed. When you talk about inspiration, even family can inspire. You know, they don't have to tell you anything or say anything to inspire you. That's what most people think the mentor tells you what to do and makes a few calls and do that. I think inspiration comes from anywhere. because at that time when I needed somebody that couldn't give me what I needed a hug that I feel from when it touches my cheek right down to my bottom of my boots. Because my mom was the only person that I got that hug from. So when Christopher was born and I could get that hug, it was something special. And that saved me from literally nearly going the other way because of the court case and all the four out from that and even though I won the case and it was you know everything was absolutely fantastic but I think it did leave a small staying again in my local area again because that's that's how it is and I still wanted to live there and it was very uncomfortable at one time but when Christopher came along it all changed because it allowed me to focus on something else that I wanted because I was a rubbish dad before that Christopher was my eighth child but I my seventh before didn't have the best of me. You know, they had that part of me that I said was where I changed into the new me. And is him now just got the Levi who is now me? And it was just great being with him and being able to express myself. So in some ways he's my mentor at the moment. Because all my love and everything is the greatest thing to go home and see him and get that hug and that sort of stuff like that. So he's my savior and my mentor at the moment. How do you find time to be both, you know, a dad at home, working on your business, doing your music, a chef also doing a... You want to see my diary, trust me, the diary is absolutely on fire. But you know what? I relish it. You know, I really do. Because, you know what I thought people say about do a job that you're inspired by, otherwise you never work a day? It is so true. It really is true. When you're doing something that you're inspired by, because for me, you know, that you're inspired by. I'm doing the two things that I love most of all, music and food, and then going out and talking to young people and trying and try and inspire. So for me, there is never a boring moment. So I juggle all of them. The only person that's have the most difficult thing is Maria, my PA. It's trying to put all these dates and the diaries together, especially when it comes now and I'm doing Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, I'm doing Princess Trust, and then there's a whole thing to do with Africa-Caribbean, which is a complete whole new, you know, a whole bag of other things that you have to do there as well too. And the schools and the prison visits that I love to keep up with as well too. But it's all inspirational. So for me, it's not tedious or anything. It's just trying to fit everything within the diary so that I can get around to as much people as possible. That's perhaps the most hardest thing. Oh, wow. What single piece of advice would you give to young people, especially like in the context of us being Oxford University right now, lots of students you know are doing exams at the moment and that were at 20 year old something and what piece of advice would you give them or something that you somebody told you when you were maybe 20? Yeah well I wish somebody had told me when I was quite younger but um this is what I would say is don't undermine your worth your own value by comparing yourself with someone else. It's because we are all different Why every one of us, each and everyone, black, white, pink or brown, is special in their own way So don't set your goals By what other people deem important Because only you can get to the best of you No one else will know at that point When you're at that most powerful point in your life When you're the best person that you can possibly do only you will know that. So don't undermine yourself. And I think a lot of people go along the way and undermine who they are. You don't love who you are. You're searching for someone else. You're searching to be someone else. And what I'm saying there is to accept who you are because everyone is different. And that person is special. No matter what frailties they have, they are the only one who is like that. You are the only one who's like that. You have to relish it, live it, you know, and breathe it. That's why I said don't undermine yourself by comparing because everyone is specially in the wrong way. So that would be my message to anyone. Right, I'm keen to you open the floor to questions very soon. But before I do so, I question relation to home. Obviously, from this conversation so far, it seems you find home in a couple places, back home in Jamaica before you moved over here at 11, back home in Brickston, but also the place that you highlighted you found yourself in the shires. I've been living in the UK for most of your life. Where would you say home is? Wow, that's a difficult one. And the reason why it's difficult because I spend all my life here. But when I go back to Jamaica, man, it's the most amazing me. I buss out in flowers, so to speak. That means your smile gets broader. Your thoughts are more vivid. or more vivid than anything else once you're at that place where Jamaicans like to say you have to go back to where your belly string is buried, meaning that you're abilipical cord. Because in Jamaica, when you're born as a child, your umbilical cord is buried in your yard, in your backyard where it is. And it's always said that no matter where you go in the end, you're going to come back to where your umbilical cord is buried. So for me, in a few years before COVID, it was always going back two, three times a year. You know, I wrote, you know, most of my books that I write, I like to go back and write the vibes from Jamaica. So it is my favorite place. It's where I call home. I don't holiday anywhere else. I don't think I've ever been on a holiday anywhere other than going back to where I'm from. Because I think it's the most wonderful place in the rural. And it's full of culture. You learn while you're there. It's not just about having a great time and then going back and next time. It is about educating who you are further. And that's why I love going there. But I don't go to Kingston, which is where everybody goes. I go back to Clarendon, which is in the countryside in my part. That's brilliant. Thank you. I'm keen to open the floor now to questions. If you'd like to ask any questions, just signal by raising your hand or card up into the area. Yeah, I recognize the... Hi, I thank you so much for coming. That's loud. Hi. I wanted to ask you, I have a complicated question and an easy question. A complicated one has to do with cultural appropriation. It seems that since kind of reggae came to the West, you know, kind of white people are sort of appropriating it yet. I don't know if you know that kind of relate to that word or not. You mentioned people being interested in Jamaican patois, obviously music as well. I think of David Rodigan, you know, in the 70s going to the sound clashes. Is that something that's on your mind you think is a problem? Second quick question is, which song reggae or not did you wish that you wrote? Yeah, cool. Yeah, the first one, oh my God, I've, you know, it is a word that I really don't like to hear, you know, appropriation. Because I got mixed up in that couple of years ago during the Jamie Oliver thing. I don't have anyone you saw that when I think it was MP Dawn Butler. I put out a post about Jamie Oliver doing something. called a jerk rice which upset a lot of Caribbean people because you can't really jerk rice and and they thought that Jamie exactly as well as everyone was laughing and yeah so Jamie got in a lot of trouble because they thought that he was cultural appropriating and doing something to make a lot of money from because now jerk was jerk was popular because of me and so it got a lot of Caribbean people angry but in saying that I actually ended up on TV defending Jamie because the reasons why I did and I got a lot of flag from my own people because I defended Jamie because I've always said that I'm the sort of chef I don't want to hold onto Caribbean food just for myself. It's one of the most difficult cuisine to change and to actually get massive out there. I was lucky to get through with reggae reggae sauce because perhaps I did it from from here and I it was so big before a lot of people could complain about it, they had to accept it. But it is one of the most difficult cuisines to change. And I've always said that I think that once you get a recipe, anyone should be able to do anything to do with it. As long as you, you know, you can, if you're going to do it originally, you should do it originally in its way. But it doesn't stop you from changing a few things here and there. And I thought that's what Jamie did. I didn't think he was culturally appropriate. because I had actually did a video with Jamie a few years before that and showed him how to do jerk and showed him the three key ingredients that Jamaican say if it's not inside you cannot refer to it as jerk of which these three none of the three Jamie had in his in his creation for the jerk rice so I thought people had a real proper you know reason to have a go at him but at the same time I thought it was great for Caribbean food because here was the king of chef doing a Caribbean dish, you know, and big in it up all around the country. And as much as I had tried, I think with one click of the finger, Jamie had brought the word jerk and Caribbean into more houses than I had within 15 years of doing it. And I recognized that. So I was on Pierce Morgan and all these programs, you know, defending and says, I don't think that it was a bad thing, this cultural appropriation. And that comes into music now when you're talking about that. At the moment, the most biggest thing in reggae is that a band, a white, band in America is just won the Grammy for the reggae category. The name is soldier and you can look at S-O-J-A which means soldiers of Jahami and they just won the Grammy which it put nearly everyone who's an officianto in of reggae you know in a coffo and again I support that because I've always said that reggae is one of the most music that draws this influence from all other genres and put that together and made reggae. So I didn't think that there was anything big with it. Appropriation, I'm not one for it because I think that we all have to draw something. We ask about what is the English food, what is the top English food here? Most people would have to say chicken teakamasa, you know, or something Indian of that, that sort of stuff. And there's nothing wrong with that. I don't think the Indians are complaining because Indian food is selling so much, nobody's talking about cultural appropriation. So I really think that when it comes to the Caribbean, I don't joke. in that sort of argument. And your final question about which song that I probably would have loved to have wrote? I would say any one of Bob Marley's songs, because I think he's the only person that I can think in music, you know, for my deal, that has never made a bad song. And I'm somebody that plays music on radio as a DJ, and I can play any Bob Molly song at any time and you guarantee that it would go down well. So I would say that any one, that any one of his songs, and I would choose that, that would be a lot of royalties. Because his album, Exodus, was seen as the album of the Millennium, which is actually brilliant. Thank you. I recognize this, the member with a blue jacket. Thank you for coming in for speaking to us. I had a question about how the process of after your appearance on Dragon's Den taking that forward, because a lot of the time Dragons Den is sort of very exciting the pitch, whether you get an offer or not, but you rarely see what happens afterwards. You've been wonderfully, incredibly successful following that, but I was just wondering if you'd tell me a little bit more about what it was like to work with Peter and Richard in the weeks after you had that pitch and exactly how they propelled you into Sainsbury's, into different avenues, and helped collaborate with you with your massive business success. Thank you. That's one that is often asked, actually, because, and I think the reasons why it's often asked, and the question is how is the relationship with Peter and I and that sort of stuff like that. I think because a lot of people who perhaps thought that, you know, I got the numbers wrong, you know, I didn't really know much about business and Peter had to sort of, you know, sort of molly coddle me right through the old thing and set me up in business. The truth is, Peter's part in my upliftment in where I am now is just been all about one phone call. Just one phone call. He hasn't done anything else apart from that one phone call. And to be fair, I don't think he needed to do anything else about that one phone call. And that one phone call happened just the one phone call. week after the den that he rang Justin King, chief of Sainsbury's, who he knew at the time. And he rang Justin and asked Justin that if he could bring me over to see him and whether Justin had seen the Dragons Den clip the week before. And of course Justin had said that he saw it with his family and him and his kids were watching it. And of course, you know, bring over Levi. Let's have a chat about sources and all that. So Huff Peter and I went to in Alpertam to see Justin King. And I remember we were still making the sauce with my kids in the kitchen at the time when I was on my way to see him just a week or so after the den. And we were making 67 bottles every time we made a batch of the sauce with the kids, like 67 batch. So you can imagine me standing with Peter and perhaps one of the most famous supermarkets, the second biggest supermarkets and Justin King, you know, he's the man. And him and Peter is having a chat about numbers. Like you said, I don't want to know about numbers when that's going on. But the only thing I was worried about is that, please God, don't let him order anything over 67 bottles. Guess I'd have a problem with that with the kids at home. And Justin came out of the room with him and Peter and said to me, O' Levi, could you please make ready and make an order for us for 250,000 bottles of fucking sauce? I just thought to myself, I'm going to have to go home and get the whip out to the kids and stuff. Make that sauce. Make that sauce. Because it was fantastic, it really was. And that was just the call that Peter made. And again, you know, when I said to Peter, how shall I play this in that instance, the first thing I asked him, he was confident that he invested in Levi Roots. He didn't need to mollycoddle me and to be there for me and that sort of stuff like that. And I think that's become the secret of our success, that my position as the brand is what's driving this whole business. And as long as I keep that integrity that I spoke about earlier, there's not much that we have to do as the brand to sell loads of sources because that integrity is there. It's only if I, I think it's the only thing that will happen that we'll have to work hard and I'll have to probably go and see Peter to have a powwow about how we can bring back the sources. If I start drinking like Madley and falling out of pubs late at nights and getting the press on my back and that sort of stuff. But I think as long as I remain who I am as I have been from day one, we don't have to have anything. The most important thing is the Levi Roots name. You know, we don't have factories. We have had over 50 products on the brand since Dragonsden, well into nearly 70 products since Dragonsden. And we don't have any factories or any liability in that kind of way. We are a licensing company, because the most important thing, as I said, is the Levi Root's name, which allows me to walk into any where even if I did want to do the bling bling range I could walk into any shop in Covent Garden and says I'm Levi Roots and blah blah blah can I do a range of this and more likely they would say yeah because the name is quite famous but again like what I was saying we have to be very careful in that that we don't just just pick and turn so it's just the integrity of who I am just allowed us to run this business without having a type of mentor that has to be there for you and shows you how to cross the teas and about all that kind of stuff. To finish off there, I think there's two really important people that you have to have in business. And I knew that from the start, and that's what allowed my business to run. Is a lawyer, really need that legal advice, and an accountant. And I think whether you can count like I can't count or whatever, business can be done just by you, just by being integrity, and putting people in place to take care where you're not good at. So I have a very good lawyer. I have a fantastic accountant, and I'm just me that makes the bruntlete. and tick around everything. Thank you very much, Mr Roots. I've got a question if no one has one at the moment. I'm a university student, obviously. And one thing that I think many university students struggle with is budgeting and ensuring that they eat well or eat at all, as well as balancing everything else I do. Is there any affordable dish that you might, would you suggest to university students, in terms of how keeping some nutrition but also having some tasty thing yeah yeah yeah you're absolutely right i think the question the answer to your question there just a simple one learn how to cook guys you know i think it's it's one of the most amazing aspect of living home i'm getting on in life is that you know how to prepare food for yourself then it becomes not about how cheap you can buy but about how delicious you can cook whatever little you have. Because when you can't cook and you spend your last amount on some ingredients that you don't even know how to put together, you know, that's even takes you further back. But I think when you know how to cook and you have that cooking science around you, even if you spend little, you can manage to make something delicious. So I would say the science is actually getting that food science and having awareness about food, I was in Sarah and Sester the other day at the Royal Agriculture University and somebody pitched a business to me about how she will be using universities to start courses about kids leaving home, I'm going into university in the gap here. And that course is learning things like ironing and cooking and all the necessary things that sometimes as young people, you tend to forget and you go out in the big wide world and you realize that, you know, I can't boil an egg and I can't really know how to cook a dish together or put a proper recipe together. And I've always thought that it's one of the most important thing that you can leave, you know, university, leave whatever with, is that sense of looking after yourself. And not just about bathing, putting on good clothes, but I think the most important thing is what goes on the inside. And that's by basically having some kind of knowledge of food science. I think that's really important. Very good, thank you. I recognize a member with a blue top. Thank you for your talk. Hi there. So if you're not cooking, where would you go for a meal? Like, have you got a favourite restaurant or someone else that you like to cook for you? Yeah. Well, you know, I live in Brixton, which again, which is this fantastic place, you know, of restaurants and clubs and are really, you know, vibrant place. So I'm lucky in that respect that I won't have to walk too far if I fancy some Caribbean. But one of the things that I was really heartened about was when I opened my first restaurant and to see how Caribbean food now is popular around the UK and, you know, restaurants are popping up all over the place to do Caribbean food. And people don't have to walk too far now, you know, to enjoy the type of cuisines that they like. I know pandemic has changed things and, you know, my restaurant went away of many restaurants during the pandemic. But I think a new beautiful thing has happened that people are making more. choices online and really still having brilliant food brought to their home now which I think is a good thing as opposed to always have to going out and taking the family out I think it gives you a chance to have to sit at home more and actually eat more so I don't have a problem with you know with that eating in now but I do think it's important to have that family aspect of eating together I think that's really important but I don't really go and eat much. When I had my restaurant it was one of the most difficult things to do. I would never encourage anyone to open a restaurant because it's really hard. I remember Peter had said to me, don't do restaurants because he's gone on Dragons Den and actually said that he would never do the restaurant. But I think when I convinced him as my partner for us to do one, it was the right thing, it was the right thing to do. But I think now I would go back into it. It's too difficult. I think I have to stay with the blessing. and the blessing is the food and drink and the sauces and the ready meals and that sort of stuff like that. That's never gone wrong. That's been amazing so far. So I think I'll stick with those as opposed to going back to building another restaurant. Brilliant. Thank you so much for speaking to us today. That's all we are working time for. I like to work you all to join me. Thank you, Mr. Witts for coming and visit us again. Thank you.
