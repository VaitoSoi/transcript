 Thank you. It's honestly a pleasure to host you here today, and I'm sure it's a pleasure for all the members in this chamber and those watching the event tonight. To start off, I know you have an address prepared for us, so I'd like to invite you to say some words to our fellow members that are watching the event today. Thank you for inviting me. Thank you. Okay, good evening, everyone. I always liked to be back at Oxford. I had a great time here. And actually it was a big break for me. I mean, I'll talk about it in a bit, but it was a hell of a break. Now, as you might imagine, I'm just delighted to have been asked to address you, to address the Oxford Union. I mean, as we all know, you look at all these buses around here. it has hosted some of the greatest figures in British political history and Boris Johnson I want to start by by telling you a bit about my background the only way you go to Oxford is on the bus that's what my physics teacher told me when I was so But you know I surprised him because I did go to Oxford and it wasn't just on the bus. He would have been very surprised to hear when my college, Corpus Christi, named a building after me. And listen, before you ask, I didn't pay for it, okay? Okay. Corpus paid for it. And I was thrilled when the president called me up and said, Peter, we're naming a building after you. Now, the next thing was that my physics teacher would have been even more surprised when I turned up on a list of the 50 wisest people in Britain. Now, what the hell that is? I don't know. but I don't know how to define wisdom. But it was the wisest people in Britain. And it included the Queen and a whole bunch of other people that you've heard of. But that's a bit seriously. That's my message inasmuch as I've got a message, which is that people can surprise you. But as long as you give them the chance, what the Sutton Trust does, is given the chance. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. Now, I grew up in a time when social mobility was still very fluid. It was the 1950s, which has been called the golden age of social mobility. It was a time when a kid like me, whose father was a Viennese refugee, who lived on a council estate in Yorkshire, could go from nowhere to somewhere. After Oxford, I moved to the States and went to work for the Boston Consulting Group. I then set up my own business, the Sutton Company, a bold, breakaway venture of mine. Listener had a really sticky start, let me tell you. After almost two years, I'd really gotten nowhere, I was running out of my money quickly. Now, I was almost certainly bankrupt, but fortunately I didn't realize it because my accounting system was so bad so I just kept on going anyway finally I made it and over the next 10 years my partners and I bought a dozen losing businesses and turned them into profitable ones let me tell you making your first million is really, really tough. But once you've done it, it actually becomes a lot easier. Now, all these businesses had one thing in common. They were boring as hell. Really boring. And that wasn't by accident. That was by design. We used to say, if it puts people to sleep at a cocktail party, it's a great business. For instance, we bought a specialty distributor to the mobile home and recreational vehicle industry. Does anyone want to know more about that? I can talk for hours about that if you want. Trust me, when you tell people you're in the mobile home business, they're climbing over the canopies just to get away from you. But there was a method in our madness, which is it's very difficult to make money in glamorous businesses. You know, sunglasses or fast boats and all that stuff. Boring businesses like we did is much easier. So as a result of all this, I ended up making 230 million pounds in roughly a decade. And I did what a lot of people do when they make some money, some serious money. I bought some nice houses. I drove some really nice cars. I joined some nice golf clubs. It was great fun. I'd be honest with you. I really enjoyed it. But then I thought, well, maybe there's something else I should be doing with my money. So then I came back to England after 20 years in America and the place had changed while I'd been away in a big way. We'd gone backwards. For instance, my grammar school had gone private. So when I was there, 100% of the places were free. Now it was 100% fee paying. It's like, well, hang on a minute. I couldn't go there now. Neither could Peter Gershner, who's a friend of mine, has done very well, and so on. And then I went, and my college at Oxford, Corpus Christi, were taking far fewer state school students. So around that time, I was invited to lunch by my old school, by Corpus, and some other folks. I mean, what could explain my newfound popularity? I'll leave you to figure that one out. Now, at this time, I approached the admissions people at Oxford, and I said, listen, you've got too few state school kids coming through. And they said, listen, it's not our problem. If they don't apply, we can't admit them. So I said, well, why don't we encourage them to apply? And maybe we'll do a summer school or something like that. They weren't at all enthusiastic until I said, I'll pay for it. And they said, oh yeah, okay, then we'll do it. Okay, so we ended up with a summer school. We got 64 kids, and a quarter of these kids ended up getting in, which was a huge surprise. I never realized that many would get in. And a large, bright light bulb went off in my head. And it prompted me to found the Sutton Trust. That's what really was the trigger. Now, since then, we've expanded the summer schools. We've got thousands of kids now in summer schools. The government picked it up early, all universities do it. We reckon close to a million kids have now been on San Francisco. So it's been an amazing initiative. Now, over the last few years, I have put 50 million pounds into the Sutton Trust, and we've raised a further 70 million. And we've done some big things. We've influenced government, we think, on at least 30, occasion, we've influenced government thinking and what happens. We've carried out 250 research studies into education and social mobility. We've pushed social mobility very high up the agenda. I mean, what leveling up is, it's basically the same as social mobility is what social mobility is about. And when I started this whole thing, when I talked to, when you talked about social mobility, this is before we did all the research, people thought it was, you know, bus services of the elderly or something like that. Now as you all are aware, it's become part of the national conversation. And just to give you a couple of stats, before the we did the social mobility work, there were five mentions in the commons about social ability. Just before the pandemic, there were 450 and there were 15 debates on it. So it's leapt into the consciousness. But the most important thing we've done at the end of the day is we have basically given. I've given 50,000 kids the opportunity to change their lives. For instance, I'll give you for instance, and there's thousands of these, there's a young woman from Blackpool who grew up with a single mum, free school meals. basically came from nowhere. She got onto our US program. We have a US program that's just unbelievable. And we're getting kids into the best America. I mean, we got 35 into Princeton, we've got 22 into Yale. I mean, anyway, so we got, seeing, she got her into, so she's on our program, she gets into Harvard. I mean, you know. I mean, she's surprised the hell out of us, to be honest. She graduates from Harvard, and she is articulate, she is poised, she is confident. I mean, she's obviously transformed. And I take her on the Today Pro, you know, this BBC 4 program. They're doing a thing on our summer school. So I take her on the program. and as soon as she started speaking, I knew I was totally outclassed. So I just shut up and let her get on with it. And you know what? She's a really smart girl. She now works for the Sutton Trust, so we're thrilled. But that is one example of many, many, many of what we've done. Now, as a result of all this stuff that I've talked about, I've been described as Britain's leading educational philanthropist, which when I saw it in print, I said, oh my God, that's amazing. And then I realized I didn't know another one, so maybe it wasn't that great. So what I do, or what I do, is entrepreneurial philanthropy. It's, it's, which means you don't just write a check and walk away. You stay very, very closely involved. In fact, writing a check is just the beginning. And I would say the need for it has never been greater with what's been going on with the pandemic. I mean, our research says the gap between rich and poor has grown monumentally in the last two years. And we've done a lot of research on this, but kids from low-income backgrounds have, you know, for all sorts of reasons, have fallen way behind. But another point I'd like to make is you don't need money to be a philanthropist. Philanthropy can be the giving of anything. Experience, skills, time, enthusiasm. And you know what? The Sutton Trust, we have about 30 people work there. Most of them are doing stuff, philanthropic stuff, outside of working for the Sutton Trust. So I think philanthropy should not be for the rich, just, but it should be for everyone. And obviously, the people you're helping get benefit, but you get a lot of benefit too by being, part of that. And actually there's much more of that goes on in the United States than there is here, and I think we could up that level, and all of you here might want to think about that at some point. So, just to conclude, my experience over 25 years now has been, if you give someone the opportunity, more often than not, they will surprise you. This is all about being surprised. Anyway, you just have to ask my old physics teacher, if he was still alive, he would be very surprised. Thank you very much. Thank you so much, Peter, for telling us a bit more about your story and what brought you to start the incredible organisations that you've started for young people everywhere. I know throughout your speech, you mentioned some of the organisations you founded earlier on in your career. I just wanted to ask if there was any advice you'd give to young people who wanted to go into being an entrepreneur and start in their own business. and what skills do you think they need to develop first? Listen, guys, I think it's a wonderful thing to do. I think it's very tough. I mean, I was very lucky in the end. What skills? Well, I think I have got a thought. I mean, there are two or three thoughts. The first one, as you gather from what I said, I think you want to stay away from the maddening crowd and I think you want to try and find a niche. So I think that's really important. The other thing that's really important, and I'm old enough to have friends who've been through this stuff, but what happens? It puts, oh, I want to be an entrepreneur, and they don't have any resource at all to look at stuff. So something comes along, and they go for it. nine times out of ten it isn't going to work out whereas I had some resource when I started and so I was able to look at a lot of different situations which I think you know it sounds oh try it's really important so you know otherwise you're pressed into jumping on the first thing as I said nine times out of ten that doesn't the other thing I would count as you on is that I mean, I started the Sutton Company when I was 35, which is, you know, kind of late. But I had 10 years of experience of, you know, Boston Consulting Group. Then I joined a operating company. And so I kind of, you know, I'd run businesses and stuff. So I kind of knew what I was doing. And I think the risk is a lot lower if you wait. I think this idea that, you know, you're Bill Gates, are you suck it back or whatever. I mean, there are those examples. But I think the probabilities of pulling that off are very low. But I do encourage, I mean, I'm sure some of you're thinking about this, but I do encourage you to think about it. I don't think you should go off after university and do this. Yeah, that's interesting. Would you say that there's a lot of pressure on young people, in today's society to, you know, know what they're doing and what their career aims are straight of the back of getting out of uni? Well, I think you guys got a better idea than I do. But I don't know, I've got, I've got a couple of kids who are just leaving uni and one of them's out in British Columbia, he's working in a restaurant and he's skiing every day, you know. Then I've got a daughter in Montreal. I don't know. In my day, You used to, you know, when you left uni, you'd go off and do stuff and then you'd find a job. I suspect there's more pressure now on, you know, having something in hand when you leave. Yeah, definitely. And also, I noticed in your speech, you spoke a lot about how you started the Sutton Trust and what motivated you, including some talks you had with your previous college corpus. I just wanted to ask what kind of helps you decide what to focus on, because I know when speaking earlier, you mentioned that the Sutton Trust has a lot of different arms that they focus on. Well, I think we've been one of the successes of the Sutton Trust is that we have focused. And we focused on social mobility. And we focused really at the more able end for one to. of a better word. And people say, well, you know, why aren't you doing other stuff? Well, actually, I share and found with something called the Education Endowment Foundation, which actually works at the other end of the spectrum. You know, it works with low-income kids from, you know, who are not necessarily very able. And that, of course, is probably a more important agenda than one we do, but we've stuck to our knitting and I think it's paid off. I think you just have to have a focus and stay with it. Definitely. So in your experience, I know you mentioned you started it quite a while ago, would you say that a lot has changed overall in terms of UK and social mobility, or is there still a lot more for us to do? Well, I think, listen, this is the story, is if you take the 1950s and compare it to the 1970s in terms of mobility, the earnings and social position of kids in the 70s was closer to their parents than in the 50s. So there was more mobility in the 50s. And then we felt it was fairly flat, maybe a touch up. We're talking, you know, but up until two years ago, that was okay. But it has fallen out of bed with this pandemic. And, you know, I mean, some of the things are, I mean, kids from low-income background, around, about 10% of them would get help from their teachers during the pandemic, whereas independent school kids would get like 80%. The kids, they wouldn't have the right kit to get online, et cetera, et cetera. So they've been hugely disadvantaged, and it's fallen out of bed. I mean, just to talk about this, I mean, it is so important to get these kids on track. and someone who worked with me, Kevin Collins, did a study and said we need $15 billion. And you know, you only get one shot with these kids. You can't just let it go and say, okay, well, take care of it in two or three years. And the government has put a derisory amount up, one and a half billion, and then they've added a few things. But it concerns me greatly that we are not taking care of these kids. And there are two things there. You are, you know, you're just behaving really badly to these kids, and they're really being disadvantaged. And also the economics of all this. I mean, we compete with other countries. Other countries are doing more for these kids. Education is not a benign activity. Education is the way countries compete with each other. So, and we, you know, we're average, we've gotten a bit below average. We have a long tail of underachievement. And it is something, you know, it's something people don't realize, but it is something we really have to take notice of. If, like you say, the government doesn't act enough, do you think that there are some more long-term impacts of the pandemic that we should be worried about? Yeah, I think the long-term impacts on education is there are a bunch of kids out there who have not got a good education of basically dropouts and that is a long-term impact. I mean, the longer-term impact, if you like, is as an educational system, We are not staying competitive with our competitors. I believe this is a competitive thing. And we've looked at what are other countries spending to enable these kids to catch up? And it's far more than we are. I mean, the Dutch are spending like 20 billion and the Americans are spending far more. So that's the long-term impact. And it's pretty gloomy. you've got to really tackle this problem. Yeah, definitely. And I know in terms of issues to do with education, the private state school divide is something that's often spoke about a lot, and a lot of people have opinions on this. But even within the state school sector, we have new chains of academies who are heavily selective, are not paid for, but are giving, you know, pupils a large advantage. What are your opinions on these schools and do you think it's creating more inequality within education or are they a good thing? Well, you know, I'm ambivalent about academies and free schools, whatever they are. I don't know what they are really. But the thing about yeah, the academy, I mean, let's cut it all. I mean, this is, if they said to me you're going to be Education Secretary, the only thing I would focus on is improving the performance of teachers. We've got 430,000 teachers out there. And the key is to make them better teachers. I mean, that's what it's really all about. And this structural stuff about, oh, academy, local authority school, free school. It's all noise, really. So the big thing about education are teachers and leadership. But teachers is really the big thing. There's a guy out in Stanford called Hanichick, who's done a lot of work on this. And he showed if you have a class for the kids, 30 kids. And one has a top teacher, top 10 percent of. One has a poor teacher. Even over a year, if you look at what the cost. of that is, it's millions of dollars. I mean, this is huge. You know, it's really important. So the advantages of getting your teacher workforce up is where it's at, really. So what do you think we can do to incentivize schools? Because I think when schools are looking at their off-stead reports at grades, they're always thinking in the short term, some would say. What can we do to incentivize schools to incentivize schools to really get to the root of the problem? Well, as I keep coming back to, you know, incentivizing schools, it's all about the teachers. And we do a poor job of in-service training for teachers compared to other places. So I keep coming back to it is, yeah, if I were ahead of a school, I would be, my main focus would be to improve the performance of teachers. And that would make the biggest difference. So in terms of incentivizing them, well, schools are incentivized by results. And the way they'll get better results if they think that's important is better teachers. So I keep coming back to it's all about teaching. But that's not just my opinion. at the Education Endowment Foundation, we've done loads of studies on what's really important. It always comes out as teachers. And the other thing is we've looked at programs for when kids get behind, how can they catch up? It's almost impossible. It really is. It's very, very difficult for kids to catch up. That's why it's so important what I said before. that the kids from the pandemic are away behind. You need to deal with that immediately. Definitely, definitely. I know I mentioned private schools earlier on. There's obviously a big debate, like in the House of Commons, in society as a whole, about whether private schools should be abolished or whether they should be kept. And, you know, like you said, focus more on improving state schools, improving the teachers. is what would your view be on whether they should be abolished, essentially? How long have you got? That's just a theoretical discussion. They're not going to be abolished. You can't abolish them. You can remove charitable status. You can't, well, charitable status is a red herring. You can't abolish private schools. So practically it isn't going to happen. I mean, that... So we're there with the... Listen, if I had my druthers, I'd wave a magic wand over this country and I have 100% of people go to comprehensive schools. But we're not there. I mean, if you go through it, we've got 1% are in boarding schools. We've got 6% who are in private day schools. We've got 5% who are in grammar schools. We've got, and that's only 2% free school meals. These are all, you know, academically very selective in a sense. Then the comprehensives, the best comprehensives, guess where they are in places where the house prices are high. So the top 20% of schools academically are shut off from, you know, nearly all the low, moderate income kits. So we have an incredibly socially selective system. Now, our solution for the private schools is to say, you can't abolish them. Let's not kid ourselves. And it goes on the whole time, this ridiculous debate about charitable status and all that stuff. It's nonsense. The only thing you can do is open them up. We have a history of opening up private schools. When I came, obviously I went to a private school for free, my old school. But what we've been working on is what we're called open access, which is 100% of the places are available on merit. Right now, it's money. And what you do is whoever gets in gets means tested, it's exactly the way the top American universities do things. And so we've trialled a thing in Liverpool. So our solution is we've got to open up to private schools based on merit, not money. Definitely. Speaking of merit, I know that is part of what the Sutton Trust is for to encourage people to apply to these universities. Do you think the current system of having births and meritocracy is working or does it still seem that universities are using this to, as essentially a checkbox activity or in order to be tokenistic. Right. Well, on this whole university thing, we've now got 51% of kids going to university. You know, kids are coming out with 50-something thousand pounds worth of debt. A number of them are coming out with degrees that the marketplace doesn't want. The stat is that five years out, about a third of graduates are not in graduate employment. So I'm really a skeptic about the whole university expansion. I mean, the projections are that the debt that's out there, only about 45% will be paid back, and the rest will be paid by the state. I mean, this is heading for a gigantic train crash. And our solution is the kids that you're talking about could go, should go into what we call degree level apprenticeships, which are our few around. And what we're talking about is kids spending time working for a company or even a foundation and doing university courses at the same time. I mean, the advantages of that are that you basically earn while you learn, you're getting paid, you're coming out with no debt, and you are coming out with skills that the marketplace wants. So we'd like to see a lot more people doing that than incurring these amazing debts. Yeah, so the Sutton Trust, you mentioned earlier, has an America program that helps people get into Harvard and great schools like that, especially Oxbridge. Right. Schools, you know, all across the world. But I think even speaking personally, getting into these schools can often be the first hurdle for people. And once they are in these schools, there's a lot that needs to be done to help them catch up with peers that may have been from private schools. What do you think the Sutton Trust or other schools? other charities are doing or could be doing to help, you know, people not just over that initial barrier, but to thrive in their university life. I mean, the answer to that is not enough. But we do some, it's just very expensive. That's a problem. It costs a lot of money to do what you were saying. But we do provide bursaries ourselves for kids. And we provide a number just in terms of supporting them. And you're right, I think there is need to provide that support going in. And we do some of it. But as I said, at the end of the day, it's very expensive. But also not just in terms of the financial aspects, but even the tutorial system at Oxford, for example, is something that may have been imitated more in private schools. What do you think, I guess, for young people who have, you know, maybe gone through your program or gone through similar programs, they could do to escape feelings of imposter syndrome? Yeah, I don't know. I mean, you're right. I mean, the private schools, in fact, I went around, before the pandemic, three private schools and three state schools to kind of see, A, how the teaching varied and, B, what other things they did. And there was a big difference. And the method of the teaching, because a smaller class, it was more like a discussion. And then there's a lot of other activities that they do to, we call it essential life skills. They come with, you know, they're confident, articulacy, all those things. And I personally think the biggest failing of the state system is they just won't focus on that. And I've talked to a number of education ministers, and they've been 14 since I set this thing up 25 years ago. So it's always a different phase. but they all say the same thing. He says, oh, we just focus on getting kids through exams and we don't have time to do all the other things. And that is a big issue. In any of these talks with these education ministers, did you feel like you were able to convince them to try and focus not just on the grades, but see education is a more holistic thing, a thing where people are growing as individuals and not just trying to tick a box to get onto the next stage? I've tried, and the word always comes back that we really just have to focus on the academics and I agree with it. I mean, I guess it's also a matter of budget, you know, how much money have you got? And they focus, I mean, the state school's now probably about $7,000 a year. a private school would probably be average about 15 for a private day school. So you've got a very different focus there. So within the Sutton Trust, I guess, you've had a lot of, you know, great students coming through. What do you do within the Sutton Trust to create a sense of community and make sure that you're not just losing this talent once it's gone through the program, but that they can give back to other younger students and really create a sense of community? Yeah, I mean, we've got an alumni. Association, which a hell of a lot of alums have joined. And, you know, we have events. We have all sorts of stuff. So I think, yeah, I think it's been really important. And they also do what you're talking about, which is go back to students coming through. You know what's been amazing is how loyal people are who've been through certain programs. I mean, it's not like they're there for a long time, but a lot of them feel grateful that, you know, they've come through the program and it's helped them in their careers. So, yeah, it's something we focus on a lot. Yeah, it's great to hear that, you know, it's something that is continuous and that, like you said, there's a lovely alumni community ready to kind of give back. Talking of giving back, I know there's been a lot of claims. that in the US, people are more likely to engage in philanthropy than the UK, and that sometimes we may have a stigma towards it. What would you say in this respect, and how can us as individuals play our part in helping younger people, helping people who are less fortunate or may not have had the same opportunities as are us? Yeah. Well, I think, you know, that's what I was talking about, about. strategic philanthropy, and I think everybody can do something. So I think people could help. But on your other question about the United States, yeah, I mean, the level of giving in America is much greater than here. It's about three times. And I think the reason is that they have an asking culture, whereas people get asked. I'll give you a little example. I mean, I had a place in Florida, my kids were at school there, and they have an annual giving, who I have in America, annual giving. So I gave him a thousand, a thousand dollars. And then this little school of 220 had a development director, only in America. So he calls me up, and I'm thinking he's going to be singing my praises. not a bit of it he said well you know so and so up the road gave 5,000 and what the hell you know I mean he's you know he's suggesting I give more well I was sort of shamed into it so I gave more I gave 5,000 anyway he kept on and on at me and ended up giving him over 100,000 so it works and if we want to if we want to grow our philanthropy, we've got a developer, you know, a giving, asking culture, as well as a giving culture. So, yeah, I guess another thing, kind of link into the topic of social mobility is that a lot of people, or some people have said that some of the efforts to, you know, increase state school students at Oxford or different institutions have kind of disadvantaged private school students in a sense. What would you say about this? And how can Oxford really rebrand itself as a place for students from any background? I don't feel sorry for private school students at all. I think they've had a big slice of the pie for a long time. But let me tell you, when I set this thing up, The percent of state school kids at Oxford was 48 percent. It's now 70. So there's been a huge amount of progress made. And my sense is that it has changed its spots. I mean, it was very much exclusive private school types. But I think it's become a lot more open than it used to be when I was here. I mean, Cambridge has done even more. So I think we're making a lot of progress. I mean, we've done some research, which I think is just incredible. We looked at the top 5,000 people in this country, in each area, totaling 5,000. We're talking law, the city, media. See, look at that. We looked at their backgrounds. And of the top 5,000 people in this country, 40% were privately educated, and 25% were Oxbridge. So you're talking nearly two-thirds. Now, obviously, there's some overlap. I'm not sure that's healthy at all. But that's the reality. And I have to, you know, take care of the reality, and we have to get our kids into Oxbridge. and I'd like to get them into private schools with some funding. But we are incredibly narrowly focused in this country. It was just staggering. So when you meet these students who you're trying to encourage to go into Oxbridge, do you think, like you said, these crazy statistics are kind of what has created a view in their head that it's not a place for them? Or what do you think is the main reason why we have such? so few state school students applying to Oxbridge or different universities around the country? Well, I think you've got a lot more than you had, so I don't think it's that huge. I mean, there still is a perception issue, and that's why we get kids in. Just to demystify the place, you know. And, you know, I've been to lots of these dinners now, and, you know, I think things have changed. I think things have become much more open. Definitely. And I know from seeing and talking to people on the Sutton Trust program, that it has had an incredible impact on a lot of people's lives and has, you know, I know people in this university, I know people studying in America, they've gone through the Sutton Trust Program and that's been their main reason for applying. I'd like to turn to the audience and ask. I just want to say something on this thing is all these programs we do, thousands and thousands of kids, it comes back to what I was saying in my remarks. My experience is if you show kids the opportunity, they'll go for it and they'll end up surprising you. So I think that's what it's all about. I think that's a great thing for us all to take away from this and, you know, think about how we can give back to other people. As I was just saying, I'd like to turn to the audience and ask if anyone has any questions. I'll take one. Yes. Great. Yeah, thank you, Rachel. And thank that it's been a great talk. So thanks a lot of learning a lot. I just want to, I'm Dan Harrison, by the way. I'm a second year history and politics student at Worcester College. And I've just got one question on, because you've been talking a lot about educational policies. So I just want to ask, are there any policies from other countries that you think, you know, we should take inspiration from that in the UK and not necessarily directly import it because we have very different culture and different history, but a policy that you think we should take inspiration from and actually implement. Thank you. Well, I work for a company called Siemens' Impe. Germany for two years and then I, so I was an employee and then I was an employer in Germany for a number of years and more people in Germany do degree level apprenticeships than degrees. And, you know, having it, haven't experienced it. And that's kind of the national policy, that's the thinking. Same story in Switzerland, same story in Austria. And if we could take something away and get it off the ground, it would be, for me, I'm really big on this, that we would, you know, we've got 350,000 kids go to university every year, we've got maybe 20,000, green-level apprentices. I would like us to see us moving in the same way as the Germanic countries. Thanks so much. Thanks, Dan, for that incredible question. And this brings us to the end of this event. Thank you very much. It's been an honor to host you here. And I'm sure all of the members in the chamber and watching online, appreciated it as much as I have. Thank you very much. Thanks so much. Thank you.
