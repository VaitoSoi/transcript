 Thank you very much for affording me, affording us this forum. I'd like to respond to a few of the points that have been made by my colleagues on both sides. First, thank you. Our world is suffused with oppression and misery and ignorance and bigotry, suffused. Many people in the United States, particularly political leaders, speak as if the United States was apart from the world, as if the United States was above the rest of the world. I don't want to over-argue my point here. I simply want to say that the United States is part of the world. The United States, too, is suffused with bigotry, ignorance, stupidity, and misery. and the United States, this powerful nation state, has done something more than something. It has appreciably contributed to the world's misery. No, the United States is not to be held responsible for everything. Absolutely not. but it is to be held responsible for an appreciable amount of the misery in the world, partly because of its remarkable power. In the various comments we heard, there were references to American history. I want to talk a little bit about American history. and I'm not going to be antiquarian here. I talk about American history and its relation to the America that exists today. The America that exists today is a huge country. Huge. Takes up a continent. How did it get to be so huge? I mean, the colonies that seceded from Great Britain, a little sliver on the Atlantic. Now, huge. Where did that come from? Now, if one listens to Americans, particularly American politicians, that was just open land. That was a wilderness waiting to be conquered. No, it wasn't. No, it wasn't. The United States of America confronted various nations. In the United States, they're called tribes because of, you know, sort of that, you know, sense of superiority. They were nations. And what happened to those nations? What happened to those nations? those nations, some of them were eradicated, some of them were, you know, allowed to go to reservations. The point is that the great landmass of the United States comes from a stupendous act of what is called, you know, nowadays ethnic cleansing. That's part of my country. and that is not to be overlooked. And by the way, we are living in the afterlife of that. That's not something that happened long ago and the scars of that are no longer with us. One can go around the United States to various Indian reservations and see what the character of life is there. slavery, reference was made to slavery. And again, our topic is, has the American dream become a global nightmare? Well, I asked the question again. How is it that millions of people from Africa got to the United States and were enslaved and contributed? and contributed, contributed mightily to the fortunes of the United States of America. Well, that happened through an arrangement, the peculiar institution of slavery, ratified by America and its founding fathers, and very, distinguish statesman afterwards? Does that have an afterlife? Yes, it has an afterlife. It has an afterlife that continues. These are not imperfections. A number of my colleagues use the term imperfections. No. No. No, this goes a lot deeper than imperfections. And the scars that are left on my country, these are not mere imperfections. These are scars that affect people day by day by day. Reference was made, and I was happy, and I'm actually very surprised to have heard the references to nuclear weapons. Because of this atrocity in Ukraine, for the first time, in a long time actually, I've been thinking about nuclear weapons. And it's horrible that we have to think about nuclear weapons. But we are in the shadow of nuclear weapons. And as a number of commentators mentioned, the United States of the United States of the United States of, America is the only country that has used nuclear weapons. Now we can debate whether that was right or not. We can debate whether that was just or not. We can have a very good argument about that. I will note that when the United States Air and Space Museum a while ago wanted to have an exhibition and a discussion of this, the United States Congress said to the United States Air and Space Museum, either you get rid of your proposed exhibition, or you get rid of us providing you with money to carry on your air and space museum. There was no discussion about that. There was no discussion about that. And that's not the only thing about which, in fact, there was little discussion. Right now, as I speak, one of the most troubling things going on in the United States of America is an effort, an extraordinary effort, an extraordinary effort, to prevent realism about the history of the United States to be made available to the people of the United States. Already a number of states have passed laws saying that teachers cannot teach certain divisive topics. This has real consequences. It already has had real consequences. the United States of America has already suffered tremendously because of a lack of public education. It stands to suffer more because of a lack of public education. And the crystallization of that, and the crystallization of the great threat that American politics poses to the world can be encapsulated in a name. Former president of the United States, Donald Trump. Donald Trump could become president of the United States again. That should put a scare in everyone. And what we have been talking about, that is to say, these various pathologies in American life, unless we know about them, unless we are realistic about them, unless we face them, and unless we try to straighten them out, these pathologies will continue to menace us in the United States of America and therefore menace the world. Thank you very much.
