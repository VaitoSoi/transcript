 Thank you very much everyone for joining us today for our experiences beyond the Equalities Act panel. structure of education and employment of to the COVID-19 pandemic, disabled people have faced systematic disadvantages. The 2010 Equality Act enshrined into law protected characteristics including disability for which you cannot be discriminated against. This was seen as a landmark years ago. However, it is clear that there's too much need to change for disabled people to have similar life chances and experiences as the rest of the population. Over a decade on since this last this landmark change has the UK made any progress and tonight we'll be discussing this and also what more must be done before we reach true equality. It is my true pleasure to introduce to you tonight's panel and I'll let Amy first introduce herself from the left. Hello I'm Dr Amy Kavanaugh. I'm a blind act, oh you can hear me now. I am a blind disability activist and content creator and also I provide consultancy, I chat about policy, I do all sorts. Would you like me to pass on to the next person or? Absolutely, definitely. Hiya, I'm Sipjean. I run and founded a non-profit called Chronically Brown, which is about representing and talking about the stigma and disability in South Asian communities. We've started things such as a campaign called Desi DESEA abled, DESE meaning South Asian mixed with disabled, to platform South Asian, disabled South Asian, sorry, work and advocacy as well as support disabled South Asians to better talk about the stigma within South Asian communities. Thank you. I'm James Kusak, I'm the chief executive of Autistica, which is the UK's leading autism research and campaigning research charity. and I'm also autistic myself. Hello, my name is Sam Phillips. I'm the CEO of my own consultancy, which is called Representation. It's a diversity and inclusion consultancy. I go in and work at a senior level in businesses. I'm currently in Lawyers of London. I've been in the ECB cricket land this year in a law company. And my background is also as a chief marketing officer working across the media landscape. Hi, I'm Dr. Saria Bariab. I'm Dr. Saria B. I am a lecturer and I also founded the Equality Act review which looks at strengthening the Equality Act 2010 and work in Parliament and with parliamentarians to make this reality. Thank you very much. Just to highlight how tonight would go on. Next I would invite some speakers to make a short speech just to help us contractualise exactly where we're at today with legislation, but also what's happened in reality. Later on, I'd ask more specific questions to each panelist and then ask general questions for us all to have discussions on. So, Saria, tell us about why you're here today. Thank you so much. Well, it's a huge honor to be here today to talk on such an important issue, that of disability rights and the Equality Act. In July 2021, at the last year, the Equality Act Review, which I founded in 2018. After I experienced religious discrimination in employment, I founded the Equality Act review. I was exposed to a lot of the flaws in the Equality Act, not only on religious rights, but across the board. And so last summer, we launched our report, Equality Act 10 years on. It's the largest and most comprehensive review of the Act to date. We argued for a strengthening of current protected characteristics such as race, sex, disability, and the addition of new protected characteristics such as homelessness, accent, socio-economic background, hair and immigration. We believe that the current protected characteristics are largely rooted in biology which dismisses a social cultural identity markers that can give rise to discrimination. And this is a really important point that is not currently reflected in our legislation in the UK. So for disability discrimination in particular, we presented the case of a bereaved widow who shared with us documents from the Department of Work and Pensions. She was denied bereaved widow's allowance, and this letter can be found within our report. The letter states that bereaved widow's allowance cannot be paid to her as her husband had not paid national insurance contributions. DWP knew that the husband, husband was a long-term disabled individual and was in receipt of disability allowance. Yet despite this, the wife was being denied the allowance which constituted as disability discrimination even after the person had passed away. Another aspect that we highlighted was that of substance dependence, including alcohol dependence. Substance dependence is a recognised mental health condition, however, while other mental health conditions such as depression and eating disorders are included as disabilities in the act, substance dependence is explicitly included, as it is seen as self-inflicted. There's also the case of unseen disabilities, so the definition of what is classed as a disability is quite constrained in our opinion. One has to have a physical or mental condition, which also has to have a substantial and all-long-term impact. on one's ability to do normal day-to-day activities and this is quite subjective as to what constitute as normal, what constitutes as day-to-day activities, it can and does vary. So conditions such as fibromyalgia then fall within a grey area as it's a condition where patients often experience flare-ups, times when the condition is more debilitating. The act therefore does not cover these individuals who may be able to do day-to-day activities sometimes and not be able to do them in other times. So it's important to note that fibromyalgia affects seven times more women than men in the UK. And so what this does is it underscores the intersectionality between gender and disability. And this is also the case for other disabilities such as PCOS, polycystic ovarian syndrome, endometriosis, each of which affect one in ten women. And both of these conditions can be debilitating for some women, while for others they can go undetected without presenting any symptoms at all. So individuals with these conditions are not automatically deemed to have a disability due to the varying impact that they can have. And it is our position at the Equality Act Review that variation in impact within a population group should not be a deterrent for recognising such conditions as a disability. This is something that the Act currently falls short on, including intersectionality. I want to quickly sum up. There's also the issue of visible disabilities as well. Recently one of the MPs, Sir Edward Lay, who also chairs the APGM's skin, talked about the discrimination he faces due to his skin condition. And so skin conditions are quite common, they're visible, but again, because they're not seen as impacting people on a day-to-day activity, impacting them based on their normal day-to-day activities, the, their ability to class within the disability framework and the definition is not as straightforward as one would often think within the legislation. So to sum up, the crux of my argument is that disability law within the Equality Act must be widened, both in interpretation and how it is applied to real-life scenarios. We must consider the invisible and visible disabilities that go on and that are not adequately protected and also consider structural factors that can lead to some disabilities which are currently not covered by the legislation such as alcohol dependence. And finally we must recognize the intersectionality penalty for women that the current laws can have which do not offer protection to so many invisible diseases that our members in our society can and do suffer from. Thank you. Thank you so much for that, Saria. I'd like to welcome Sam to give her speech. Hello everyone, it's absolutely fantastic to be here at Oxford University talking about disability. When I was at university, not Oxford, I knew absolutely nothing about disability. and I also wasn't one of the 53% of the population who have a close family member with a disability. Back then, but that changed. 18 years ago, my eldest son was born, he was born, still born, resuscitated after 14 minutes, litany of woes, at the end of which was, and we think he's got Down syndrome. He wasn't supposed to survive, he did survive, he is incredible. He reads, he writes, he's the funniest person in my family and that changed an awful lot. Ten years ago, my husband was a lot. my husband was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He subsequently died, so I am widowed. Those two facts that I've just given you make me an unusual case of having two blue badges in my family. And if anything is going to give you the energy to really drive change around this world of disability, is when things like that happen to you very personally. My youngest daughter is called Tallulah. She wasn't called that. She was called Svetlana. We adopted her from a Russian orphanage. Always on the lookout for science of institutionalization. None so far. She did have some eye troubles, which you've had to correct. and she has some strong glasses. Interestingly, therefore, she is not classified as being disabled. However, were she in some other countries where you can't access glasses, she would be because her eyesight is particularly poor. And then just to complete the entire set, three years ago, my middle child, I was diagnosed with ADHD, so I know a thing or two around disability. I, as I said in my introduction, I was a chief marketing officer for 20, 25 years on boards, but over time I did more and more in the area of what we now call diversity and inclusion. A lot of work around things like gender, a lot of work around ethnicity, and also an awful lot of work around disability using the platform that I had from professionally to speak about disability at first with trepidation because nobody was talking about it. And increasingly with a great degree of confidence because the feedback was so positive that we should be talking about this as we go forwards. That was spotted by the government and I spent three years as the advertising sector champion for disability too. The three things I just want to focus on. now, first of all, education, then employment, and then I want to talk a tiny bit about the pandemic. Education. So the fantastic work that has been done here that you've heard about is so important, building on the Equality Act of 2010 and looking at it again now. However, what I would say is that this sort of work is often sits within the domain of HR, legal teams, when you go into businesses. And it's my firm belief that actually we've got a real issue because we don't actually help people, the general population to really understand disability. We do not teach this stuff in schools, but why not? Why are we not actually out there? This is how you speak to someone who is blind. This is how you speak to someone who is deaf. This is what you don't do, crash down, when you're speaking to someone in a wheelchair, for example. This is what the red cord in a toilet is for. So don't move it out of the way. We don't have those conversations. We are woefully lacking in disability awareness training. And therefore you get people coming out of schools and going into the workplace who simply don't know things. And therefore what happens is that they will clam up, and they will let the fear of having those conversations take over. We need to address that. We also don't teach numbers in schools. So when I say to people, 20% of the population has some sort of a disability, they usually go, you are absolutely having a laugh, okay? But that is one in flight, that is a huge number. And if you start to actually really understand the volume of people we're talking about, you can then start to go, this really is something very important that we need to move forwards in. Some of the other stats within that. So, you know, talk about disability, people go wheelchairs. 4% only of people with disabilities sit in wheelchairs. Some of the work that the doctors my right has done is really key in actually understanding some of the systemic issues and the intersectional issues that go beneath this. So I'm going to refer back now to my eldest child, Matt, so I spoke about earlier. I had the wherewithal and I'm talking fiscally and cereally and the real drive that for a year and half of my life I spent taking my local authority to court to make sure with him at the age of five that he had the very best education for a child with a disability as possible. It cost me 20,000 pounds. I knew from the word go that even if I won, and I did hands down, I would not get a penny of that back. So the structural systems that are in place that has given my child a really good education, including things like a fantastic level of speech and language therapy every week, is just not available to lots of people. You start to look at that. That's crazy. And when you dig into that, the reality is that local authorities know that only one in 15 people, families, will take them on. They're for it is cheaper for them to fight that one than to give what these children would benefit from to every child. Employment, the workplace. The fear that comes when people not know what to do, what to say, plays through into the workplace. And it just seems to be a step too far for a lot of employers to actually really think about disability as well. So you get to the stage where you get 96% of companies in the UK saying that they are really good at D&I, and really big on fixing it, only 4% actually focus on disability. That is a serious lack as far as I'm concerned. And if you're not talking about anything else, commercially, we've got to think about this. $8 trillion globally. That is the spending power of people with disabilities. In the UK, 80 million pounds a year. And we are not tapping into that money, that purple pound. What we're also not doing is making it easy for people to access the disabilities, whether it's through the digital world and e-commerce now or whether it's to actually be able to get into your shop restaurant, whatever it might be. The pandemic, a very, very quick word on. that it has disproportionately effective people with disabilities two-thirds of people who have died in the pandemic have had some sort of a disability. 59% this is a scope figure of people with disabilities feel that they have been just forgotten by the government and goodness knows what Boris is announcing now but the needs of the 3.7 million people in this country who are clinically extremely vulnerable may not have been put at the top of his list so education I think coming to a close absolutely important the ally's of people who haven't got disabilities themselves but can actually get out there and make people, companies really focus in on this is really key. And moving towards acceptance. Yeah, one of the greatest things that the neonatologist told me when my eldest son was born, he said these words, and they've been profound ever since. Different doesn't have to mean worse, you know. Thank you. Thank you very much, Sam. James. Great. Well, thank you very much for having me today. It's a huge honour and it is actually not just an honour to be here, it's an honour to be part of such an amazing panel. This is the first time that I've actually spoken in person, I think, in two years, so I'm not sure how this is going to go. So please forgive any bumps in the road as I make my way through this. I'm used to sort of just looking at a webcam and hoping that people are enjoying themselves rather than actually working out if they are. So I need to start with an honest admission. I am so pleased as an expert in the Equality Act here on this panel because I am not an expert in the Equality Act and I'm not going to try to be, especially with well qualified people here to talk to that topic. You know, what I do know a lot about is autism. And so I'm going to focus on that, really hoping that some of the themes that I mention are relevant to the broader discussion. So in terms of my background, I was diagnosed as being a testistic. when I was 12, but really from the age of two, my parents were aware that I had developmental difficulties. And I'm here today because I've been pretty lucky, to be honest with you. I'm pretty privileged in a number of different ways. I think if my life and the people around me were different, if I didn't have parents, like, you know, my parents were very much like Sam, they've had to fight for me to get me to where I am today, I would be in a very, very different position today. So I just want to mention that I feel very lucky to be able to to do the things I am able to do today. Up until, from the age of 16, I've worked in schools, I've worked in care and health settings, and I've most commonly worked as a researcher. And I recently joined, well, say recently, that's not true, seven years ago, I joined Autistica, which is the UK's leading research and campaigning charity for autism. And for those of you that aren't familiar with autism, autism is a developmental disability that means that you interact with the world and other people in a different way. So it's always tempting for me to say that nothing has changed for disabled people. But do we know if that's true and what is it that we want to change? And as a former scientist and someone who used to be a researcher before I joined the research charity, the answer is I'm not always sure that we know how much things have changed and how much things have improved for disabled people. Because until we make disabled people count and measure what works for them and we listen to disabled people about their lives and what's important to them, we don't necessarily know. And I think that it's only recently that society has got good at doing that. And when people ask me why Autistica exists, it ultimately comes down to the inequalities that autistic people face. And the fact that those inequalities are quite stark, particularly in terms of social inclusion, life expectancy, and mental or physical health. To focus on one area, only 22 to 29% of autistic people are on work, depending on what year you take from the office for national statistics. It is stark, but there's something important there. We know how many autistic people are on work now, and we didn't know that a few years ago. And so having that information means that autistic people now count, and that's a really important step forward. So that's good, we've established a problem and we need to know what to do next. I also think the emergence of the discussion of reasonable adjustments, which I know is discussed in the Equality Act, is potentially a game-changing thing for autistic people, and the recognition of autistic people in that act is game-changing as well. You know, there's a fantastic example of someone that we've worked with who, with the right reasonable adjustments, has gone from a stage where they really struggled to function in their job to absolutely smashing it out the park at Google, and it's just small but transformational changes. But we've also seen, I've also seen autistic people in a range of different roles, including people in very senior positions, who are now beginning to feel that they can't. talk about the fact that they are autistic which to me is a sign that society is changing but an equality act cannot do it on its own and if we are to become better at implementing things like reasonable adjustments for autistic people and disabled people we need evidence of what works ways of implementing change and that's what we are trying to do as a charity we need an acceptance of disabled people and a world that is accessible and has an enabling support system. So to answer the questions, has the Equality Act helped? Yes, I think it has helped today and I think it will help tomorrow. Have we made enough progress? I'm an optimist, but I'm also impatient, so I will always say, no, we haven't made enough progress. But there are measurable and clear examples now of why it could be easier for autistic people to to get a job than it was. And we need to hold on to that because we need to understand that progress is possible. And it's very tempting to say that things aren't getting better, but I think we are making progress. And that's why, you know, at Autistica, we want to set ambitious and visionary goals for the next 10 years. We want attitudes to autism to be more accepting, public spaces to be more accessible, for it to be easier to get a job if you're autistic, to get the right support if you're autistic, you're anxious, to get the right support from the moment, you get a diagnosis which you don't at the moment, and to have parity in terms of access to healthcare, which we don't have in the moment. Legislation can pave the way for that change, but the inequalities that autistic people face are also the consequence of a number of far-reaching injustices faced throughout their life, lack of access to education, per attitude, and no support, as I said. In autism, I know that we've made some progress, but we are only at the foothills, Is this legislation combined with investment in evidence-based solutions, societal and attitudinal change, and investment in the right services and support that will deliver real change for autistic people? We can, and as I said, I am an optimist. I believe that we are moving towards a better, fair society for autistic people and disabled people, where all autistic people can meet their vision of a happy, healthy, long life. but there's still an awful lot of work to do yet. Thank you very much, James. I'd like to invite Jean to present her submission. Hi, yeah. Thank you so much for having me and for bringing my thoughts to this panel as well. Just like James has just mentioned, I'm not an expert in the Equality Act. I'll be completely honest I had to do my research before coming back on this panel. And where I want to start is the reason why Chronic P Brown exists. The biggest reason is intersectionality is not addressed. And it is not addressed fully to the extent of having those people that are living those experiences are represented in a way that that is full and one of those things that I made sure with Chronically Brown is making sure that disabled South Asians were at the forefront not just myself but just anybody that was living any kind of disability and one thing I also want to mention within this question of if the Equality Act has helped one thing that struck me with equality is this almost a need to thank and be grateful for equality. And I don't think I want to talk about the prose of the Equality Act for this reason itself. I think there always is an improvement in equality, in activism. There is always something that we need to be changing, addressing. And this became very aware to me when I had my own experiences. So I've not been disabled my whole life. I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 20 while I was at university. And it was a condition that affected my mobility. It was a physical disability. And whilst having my diagnosis and waiting for medications to work, I was extremely housebound, isolated from the world. I'm sure you can imagine at 20 years old, that wasn't the best experience, especially at university. It changed my experience dramatically. And within that, the university that I went to actually was not supportive in the way that it should have and actually breached a lot of the Equality Act as well. And this is where, oh, sorry, can no one hear me? Thank you. Can you hear me now? Okay, sorry. I think I've lost my train of thought now. Oh, I can hear myself now. That's great. Yeah, so I was at university very isolated after this condition. I was housebound for, I think, around a year. The university was not supportive and one of the tutors that I had had actually explained to me that if I had not passed the year and got the grades that I did in the end, would have been kicked off the course completely because of my attendance rate, which was something that shocked me and I thought there was something wrong with that. Because I was not aware of the Equality Act and my rights as a disabled person, I actually struggled to express that to them. And these are the kind of lived experiences that I think are really important to be sharing, to be platforming not just from the disabled white lens, but from the disabled experiences of all races, ethnicities, cultures, and all the other protected characteristics in the Equality Act. And one thing that I did notice when I was doing my research as well, and please correct me if I'm wrong from the experts, but there is only two protected characteristics at a time. I believe. I don't know if I'm... Is this... Is it... No, I mean the intersections of them. And that struck me quite badly as a brown disabled woman who is also not from a Christian faith. There's so many different intersections for just myself. And then with the people that are support, there is even more intersections that also need to be platformed. And this was really, really upsetting. really upsetting and I think is again something that needs to be addressed as well as the other kinds of intersections with marriage equality a marriage is a protected characteristic under the Equality Act but do we actually have marriage equality if we actually are not allowing disabled people to have their PIP removed if they were to get married to somebody of us is it certain salary I believe. I'm losing my words, I apologize. I've been thrown off with the mic and these are again all things that need to be addressed thoroughly and I think the big problem with the Equality Act is this overarching act for all protected characteristics when really we should be having separate acts for each protected characteristic that addressed all these intersections, which is again something that I wanted to address fully with this issue. And I'm hoping again would be brought back because we did have the Disability Discrimination Act once upon a time and it changed and was included with the Equality Act, which is such a shame. And the reason why I'm highlighting these things is because although these are conversations within the disability movement and we do have platforms within social media and we are discussing these things. It's not discussed in the right places. They're not discussed in places where things can be changed and it's something that I wanted to make sure I highlighted and made sure that that voice is definitely carried in the right places and I hope it's well would be carried with the representation of the Sailed South Asians. because it's my passion work. So, yeah, thank you. Thank you very much, Jean. And finally, but not these, I would like Amy to present whatever submissions you might like to share. Hello, everybody. Hopefully my mic, oh, I can hear myself, my mic is working. I just think the panelists have all said some really, really interesting things. For myself, I didn't use to call myself disabled. It was a word I didn't use about myself. Even though I was born blind, I have some residual vision which fluctuates. And I grew up thinking that disabled was bad. It was an embarrassing thing to be disabled, that I shouldn't mention my visual impairment. And I spent 27 years of my life basically faking my non-disabled man. and that's a real mind-blower for a lot of people out there because usually people think it's the other way around. And I went all the way through academia until I reached a PhD and suddenly years and years of having no support, not being part of the community, not having the resources or, you know, even just the honesty with myself meant that I had huge memories, health crisis and I left academia after I finished my PhD because it was a space that I found exceptionally unwelcoming to disabled people which is why it feels extremely smug to be here today because there's no way I would have got here as a PhD but for myself the Equality Act did technically give me all those rights and I think this is our greatest challenge is that the Equality Act is a rather comprehensive and complex piece of legislation. But the fundamental problem is that it still rests with the individual. And as has been described by my fellow panelists, if you want to challenge the Equality Act, you have to do it yourself. We don't have a regulatory body, which would be extremely helpful. Legal aid has been slashed. And essentially, as a piece of legislation, is what it says, it says hire people with protected characteristics. you are the groups who are most likely to be marginalised and discriminated against by society. We're going to give you all these rights, but it is entirely your responsibility to uphold them. We're not going to regulate businesses properly. We're not going to regulate employers properly. We're not going to regulate the government properly. But technically you could go through this long and painful and complex court case, which will be very, very expensive, to establish that you have these rights. And there's a guide dog owner. This is Ava. She's very confused. She doesn't know what this is. She also would really like her dinner because it's dinner time and she thinks it's really rude that all of you have prevented that. She's also had a weird day because of the storm and we had a train and then she doesn't know what's going on. But I have legal rights as a guide dog owner. And I'm a content creator. I'm a social media person. I don't really like... I feel weird about the word influence, though. I don't know how you feel about the word... because when I try to describe what I do now I tend to say I'm just like an angry blind lady on the internet I don't know that I influence much but whenever I describe an experience of discrimination around Ava not being allowed in a business or being refused a service one of the first responses I get and I'm sure my fellow panelists have this as well oh but that's illegal that's illegal that is illegal that they've not let your guide dog in that cafe. I'm like yeah I know it still happens because the laws you know I can't be like hello police this cafe wouldn't let me have a latte because I've got a dog it's that that function within the law isn't there and I have to carry the equality act around with me not legally obliged to do so but everywhere I go I have to carry the equality act with me because whenever I go into businesses, I will have this conversation. No dogs. She's a guide dog. No dogs. She's a guide dog. I'm blind. You can't come in. If you're refusing me service, you're refusing me service on the basis that I'm disabled. This is indirect contravention of the Equality Act. I'm now going to show you this section of the Equality Act. We go through that conversation, oh, no dogs. And then I go, right, I'm going to start filming you now because you're now breaking the law. and I'm going to use this evidence in a court case. That tends to change their minds to nine times out of ten. Sometimes they still don't care, because that's the point. A lot of us are very well versed in the Equality Act, but the general public is not. Guide dogs have been allowed in public places on transport in businesses, in cafes, for 25 years. And yet, businesses, employers, organisations, repeatedly claim ignorance. And when a business claims ignorance to me, when I write them a nice letter before action, I say, well, are you ignorant of the laws around underage drinking? Oh no, well, we serve alcohol here. We understand all those rules about underage drinking, and I said, well, you serve disabled people too. There is a severe lack of awareness about what the Equality Act constitutes. And frankly, and I do understand the points made about, about allies and education and awareness but I've done awareness until I'm blue in the face and like I've made a job out of being like really super educated about you know everything that I do and I've made a commitment to live that life but not every disabled person should have to do that we shouldn't be a walking encyclopedia of our needs and our conditions and the rights that are attached to them and yeah I I would love people to be better educated about how to have a conversation with a blind person. Top tip, just talk to them. We are humans. You know, you can just speak to us. You do not have to use this voice. But actually, what I really want the general public to know is the law, and there are obligations under the law, because I don't want to be accepted, because I'm a human being. and the fact that I should ask for acceptance because I'm blind is deeply insulting. I want the general public to learn about the law when they're employers, when they're customers, when they're running a cafe, when they witness me experiencing a hate crime. I want people to understand the law. And the second part of that, see, she's heard this a lot, she's gone to sleep now. She's like, oh God, she's talking about the equality act again. Is that rights and the law are great. But again, as the panel has highlighted, rights don't always mean choices. There are some incredible activists who fought extremely hard in the 1990s to get the Disability Discrimination Act. And I had the great honour and privilege of talking and working with some of them over the summer over the summer in a film about the disability movement, which is coming to the BBC in March. And what was wonderful about it was being in that community of disabled people. And there were many generations of disabled people there. There were the original activists who chained themselves to buses and threw paint over the roads and stopped, you know, parliament functioning, burst into TV studios. And there were people like me who'd grown up as the Equality Act developed, developed. The Disability Discrimination Act established my right to go to school. It came out in 1995, I was born in 1989. Luckily, I got the right to go to school as that act happened. And then as I was a student and going through university, I then got additional rights under the Equality Act. And also in that group of people were younger people, probably some people watching now, people are 18, 19, 20. A lot of them who grew up, who grew up, and they were up with those automatic rights granted under the Equality Act for most of their lives. And that's great. I love that I have the right to go into a cafe. Yay! But what I really want is choice. I want choice in education. I want choice in where I live. I want choice if I can get married. I want choice about how I have a child. I want choice about my work. I want choices. I want the same choices as non-disabled people. And frankly, I'm sick of asking because it's already the law. Thank you. Thank you very much for that, Amy. So I'm just going to sort of like feedback from what you guys just said. I'm just picking up on the last thing that Amy spoke about and highlighting how there's a current theme in everything that everyone has said here today. We recognize that we have laws. but unfortunately they're not comprehensive or exhausted enough in highlighting everything is needed. We have people who know about disabilities but lack the awareness and the full of appreciation of what it means and how they're affected. And of course we don't have a system that enforces those who do not follow this. And I wanted to ask one simple thing right now that we could probably suggest, what simple thing would you suggest that what simple choice would you promote for a non-disabled person to take to create a more inclusive culture in pursuing of sort of like an environment that does not exclude disabled people but actively includes them. I'll start, I think talk with people. I mean, I think you pointed at the end there, you know, there's so many people who get sort of so clammed up about talking about disability or two people with disabilities. And this is just crazy because, you know, I say, we're all humans, these are human beings and yet we don't engage. if you actually just talk to people and get to know them, and if you're not sure, people can sniff your intent, yeah? They can. If you're asking with sort of a, in your voice, people will get that. If you're asking because you genuinely are leaning in because you don't know and you want to know, then the responses will be fantastic, and your learning curve goes up. And then you start to not only learn, but you start to unlearn as well, some of the things that you thought must be true of someone who is deaf, blind, whatever it might be. And then you're into a really, far deeper, better conversation and you can actually grow as a person, as a human being, as a business person. So just talk. It's pretty blaming simple, really. Thank you. So following on that, obviously highlighting that there is perception, or there's a view that I agree with, that disabled, disabilities is something which doesn't exist innate of people, but actually our systems and our society, or that creates it by not accommodating for different types of people that exist. In view of this, do you think that perhaps there should be much more stringent ways to hold to account either people, governments, or perhaps institutions that do not implement or do not have inclusive processes currently that maybe we should go further with the Equality Act? Yeah, I would certainly agree with that. So in terms of DNI, diversity and inclusion rates, companies with over 250 employees are required at this current moment in time to report their diversity amongst their employees. we recommended last summer in our report that this should be bought to 50 or more. So any company which has 50 or more employees, they should be required to report that. It shouldn't be based on 250 plus and therefore only then are you able to report. I think every company should have, every organisation should be reporting these things, including disabilities. how many employees they cater for, they accommodate or they don't accommodate for, how many employees are registered as disabled or that they are aware of and that have disabilities. At the current moment in time, I don't think there is any such legislation in place for that. And I think it should be brought into effect sooner rather than later. Thank you very much. James, I think you want to say something? I was just really struck by Amy's point because I was thinking about it when I was in the taxi and the way here about the lottery that's involved with where you work and I've had so many people that have joined Autista cars and said this just didn't happen before I joined Autistica. And by the way, Autistica is not perfect either. Like it's still trying to get things right. But it's amazing how there just isn't a culture and a sort of awareness around making workplaces inclusive. And so it almost feels like it's like a nice thing to do, like rather than something which you're legally, like, legally required to do. So we sometimes have people who are like, oh, thank you. This is an amazing place to work. And actually, you know, the point that Amy is making is really important is. It's not really something that you should be doing because you're like a nice person or you're a nice place to work. It's something you should be doing because it's just a legal requirement. I think it's really interesting that you almost have to feel grateful that people are flexible in that way rather than workplace is understanding that actually the expectation is on them. Thank you. So Gene, you highlighted in your submission earlier on how you were inspired to set up chronically Brown, given your very specific unique lived experience. And further one highlighted how perhaps we should dismantle the Equalities Act and create much more specific type of act that deals with different types of specific projected characteristics in a way that can be much more holistic. Obviously you're an activist and you understand what you've gone through. and there are different types of people, how could you perhaps maybe inspire or encourage others to sort of like what the process is for them to set up their own clinical, Brown, or their own agencies to deal with their specific lived experience with disabilities? I think when you're starting with activism and within the disability area, it's starting off small, it's having small conversations. with the people closest to you. And it's going from just general conversations that start to change and unlearn and then relearn what you know about disability and if those are your experiences as well, learning from the different kinds of disabilities there are out there as well. And then going from those kinds of conversations to making sure you're talking to a wider range of people. And I don't mean just that I don't mean just the disabilities, but I mean from each kind of protected characteristics within the Equality Act, whether that's ethnicity or if it's someone from the LGBT community or if it's for age as well, it can literally affect anyone. And that's where diversity comes into it because I think within the wider disability movement, it has become majority white-led and it's become very tunnel vision for what white disabled people need, which ignores a huge, huge number of people that actually do need help and support, and whether that is very specific help and support. And it's making sure you know about those experiences, so then you can do something about it. One thing I learnt from my own activism is that although I've experienced these things, I haven't experienced it to the same level as other disabled South Asians and almost have some kind of privilege where I can speak about it so that I am not, I can't think of the right word, so I'm not, I'm not, I really can't think of the right word, but so I'm not, I'm not, I really can't think of the right word, word but this is the life of a disability the words just leave me but it's I'm I'm not that the South Asian community can then not attack me for what I'm talking about because I actually don't have that many South Asians around me where they can do that either so to put myself into that experience and making sure that I am surrounded by them so that I can speak for them is the biggest part part of what I do and I think that's where probably you can start if you are to start talking about the intersections of disability and other communities. Thank you very much. We have one more time, time for one more last question. I'm going to direct this to Dr. Kavanaugh. Obviously the obvious has gone on. COVID-19 has been part of our lives for the past two years, unfortunately. I want to ask how you think it's changed the landscape for what to say with people. and whether you think it's helped spotlight less spoken about issues or push issues further down the agenda in the landscape of activism? It is a difficult question because it depends, you know, the disabled experience is so vast. And so I can't speak for everyone's experience, especially during the pandemic. I was not shielding, but I faced social barriers, for example, Ava only turned up halfway through the pandemic, so I was still using my white cane, and I found things like social distancing, obviously impossible. I can't see two meters away, so I don't know where you are. I would say that you just have to think about that whiteboard that Dominic Cummings shared. Who do we not save? Who do we not save? Not who can't we save. Who do we not save? And if we look at the do not resuscitate orders slapped on disabled people without their consent, I think the pandemic threw into sharp relief the gross inequalities that disabled people have faced. And, you know, as we said, we don't know what Boris is saying now, although I think we can all guess. You know, clinically extremely vulnerable people are just being tossed by the wayside again. The rest of society wants to get on. your needs and your life are too inconvenient, the risk of your death, well, I just want to go back to the pub. And when you're a disabled person, and that's your life, when you're being told that your life is so unimportant that people are happy to let you die, how much do you think that makes you feel like being part of a society, being part of a culture, being part of a country? And I would just really build on the point made by several colleagues here, we've got to look at who's not in the room, who's not sat at the decision-making table, and it isn't just disabled people. And I think some excellent points made here that the disability movement is too white, it's extremely white. You know, where are disabled people, where are black disabled people, where are trans-disabled people, where are gay disabled people, people who face multiple intersections and marginalisations, face even more vulnerabilities and marginalisations because of the behaviours of others. And that's the other thing. These words like vulnerable and shielding, they did what always happens to disabled people is they made our deaths feel inevitable. Francis Ryan wrote an excellent piece in The Guardian about this, this assumption that these deaths were inevitable, these six in ten deaths were inevitable, rather than actually examining a society that systematically excludes disabled people, despite the legislation, and a society that accepts the death of disabled people as inevitable, oh well, they were very ill. Or they had an underlying health condition. Did you know having a sprained ankle was listed as one of the underlying health conditions? We've got to look at data and the way that the government very strategically eradicates disabled people in our lives from society. You know, this government is borderline eugenesis. and it's treatment of disabled people and it was found by the UN to be grossly in violation of disabled people's rights. What, four years ago? Has anything changed? No, it's got worse. And people occasionally go, oh, well, having an online meeting is nice and it's like, yeah, Sharon, it's lovely, but I would actually like some fundamental rights and not to be left to die. So I think that it's shown a few people, a few people have started spotting it, but if anyone does take anything away from today, I ask you to examine, like, where are the disabled people and why aren't they in the room? Because did we leave them at home to die, or is it just too inconvenient to have them in the space? So the pandemic has been a very difficult time for disabled people, and I think we will hopefully emerge from it resilient to those of us that are still here, but our success in the future relies on non-disabled people, stepping up. stepping up when you see a missing drop curb, stepping up when you see a doctor dismissing a woman's pain because she's disabled, stepping up when you see a hate crime, stepping up for yourself. You know, we're all educators here. We all do this for a job and we do it day in and day out. We're on the internet. We write books. We're on the radio. We're on telly. We're sat here. Follow disabled people. Follow chronically brown. Like, educate yourselves. Be part of that community. not just of being a friendly ally, but being an active participant and citizen in the disability rights movement. Thank you so much. On that note, I'd like to sort of like thank you all, Amy, Sojean, Saria, Sam and James for coming and raising us as a great panel talk today. I'd like you all to join me in thanking them as well. Thank you.
