 Well, Mr. President, August members of this union, I'm going to take a slightly different tack in my argument this evening, one which you won't hear politicians at Westminster use very much, but one which is a uniquely Welsh angle, because I am a Welshman. I come before you as somebody who has a primary identity of being Welsh. I'm far more Welsh than I am British. grew up speaking a language at home whose progenitor was on this island when the Romans were here, long before English or Scots arrived for that matter. The language right called Camraig, the language that we referred to today, we're speaking today, we referred to us, Saisnay. I've got no great sense of Britishness. My wife is a Belfast Catholic. She has no sense of Britishness. And she grew up in a society where identity was an indication of whether you would live or die in some parts of the city of Belfast and I saw it in the 70s, 80s and 90s. She has an Irish passport. My kids have got an Irish passport. Have you any idea how annoying it is to be in a separate slower passport queue while they go through and you're left there trying to get through with a massive queue that's been creative because of Brexit? But that's another debate, I suppose. I would never accept the idea of a British football or rugby team. It would almost cause me to take up arms to stop it. And I say that in the full knowledge of the pain I had to suffer with my Scottish colleagues here after last Saturday's result. You didn't have to clap at that, but there you are. I accept that Scotland can be independent. I accept that Wales can be independent. I accept that England can be independent. But what I suggest is that that's not the answer. If you look at the opinion polls since 2014, there have been one or two polls that have shown a majority in favour of independence. There have been others against. What is clear is that the settled will of the Scottish people hasn't changed since 2014. There hasn't been a huge surge towards support for independence in that time. And how many referendums do you need? How often should they occur? That's the question. The last one was in 2014 has there been a change in the viewpoint of the people of Scotland since then I would argue that there hasn't been. Please, some information. Of course. I listen to your success in as, as First Minister, and it seemed to me that he agreed that because the Scottish Parliament have voted to have a referendum and because a majority, an absolute majority, of people in the last Scottish elections have voted for parties proposing independence, then that Scotland should have the right to have another referendum. Is that your views as well? I don't think Scotland the settled world the Scottish people is clear and I don't think it has changed since 2014. If in time the SMP continues to win a majority in the Scottish Parliament, the argument might be different but that's not where we are at the moment. And I'd argue that independence is not worth the dislocation, the argument, the disruption that it would inevitably cause. I'm going to argue there's a better way. I'm not going to tell you the British state is wonderful, far from it, there's a lot wrong with it. It's over-centralised still. It has a capricious and inconsistent way of moving money around the UK. The Treasury makes up its own rules as it goes along. I'm not going to argue that a system where a Parliament, where a majority is elected by a minority of voters, is ideal. I'm not going to suggest that parliamentary sovereignty, where an institution says we can do what we want, an institution that's the ultimate law-making institution, but is itself lawless, that that is the best way forward. But I'm going to make the case for reform and not for rupture. because if we look at what has happened within the UK, if we look at the debate we've heard today, most of the debate has been about policy and not about the structure of the UK. It's been about things that UK governments have done over the past few years, promises, perhaps, that haven't been kept. I sat in many, many meetings of UK ministers, and there were a lot of them, meetings and ministers, they came and went all the time. And it's quite true to say that many of the promises that were made that weren't kept. but that's not an argument for independence, that's an argument for a different government, not for independence itself. Somebody asked the question, what is this going to do with Wales? It has a lot to do with everyone else within the UK. If Scotland leaves, it doesn't mean that suddenly there's no effect at all on everybody else. If Scotland leaves, what do you call the country that's left? What flag does it use? You have a flag where one country is left, most of another country left a hundred years ago, and one country my own is a country, represented at all. What do you call that country? What happens? What are the terms of the breakup? None of that was ever made clear at the time of the referendum in 2014. We will be left with a UK that is more unbalanced than it is now. So it has a huge effect on Wales and a huge effect on the other countries of the UK. If we look at some of the issues that were raised at the time of the 2014 referendum, they were unresolved then, they're unresolved now. The issue of currency, I couldn't have. understand what the policy was in 2014. What? Do you join the euro? No. Do you have your own currency and your own central bank? No. No, what we'll do, the argument was at the time, is we'll use someone else's currency and have a seat on that other country's bank as well. Well, that doesn't work. The issue of pensions was never resolved. The issue of debt was never resolved. Surely, some might argue, a country that has a barnet share of spending should acquire a barnet share of debt. Surely, that's the fair way forward. All these things are still unresolved. And there's one issue that hasn't been mentioned by any of the speakers here. In 2014, arguably, it would have been easier for Scotland to become independent. But because of Brexit, that's become more complicated. Look at the Northern Ireland protocol. In 2016, I was blue in the face telling people what about the land border we'll have with the EU and they didn't understand it. Seven years on, we still don't have a settled Northern Ireland protocol. Why? Because of a land border between the EU and the UK on one island. That problem would simply be transplanted under this island and we end up in a situation where the same arguments that have bedeviled Brexit over the past seven years would simply be applied here. Because if Scotland did rejoin the EU the same issues arise over the border and the same problems arise and we are still nowhere near resolving those issues. And for me there's a better way forward. is a better way forward the UK can and needs to be reformed there need to be restrictions on the way the Westminster Parliament operates and what it can do in terms of interfering and devolved matters it's doing it already the Internal Markets Act the subsidy control bill all examples of heavy-handedness by Westminster there need to be curbs and a greater understanding of the relationship between the different parliaments within the UK that much is true the House of Laws to be replaced with a body that reflects the geography and diversity of the UK, a Senate of nations and regions, if you like, something that reflects the geography of the UK and not just its population, drawing on perhaps the example of the Senate in the US. A greater voice needs to be given to the English regions. They're always forgotten in this debate. They sit there, you look at Manchester, if you look at the northeast of England, they are often forgotten about when we talk about what the future relationship in these islands should actually look like. That needs to be dealt with. We need to make sure, of course, that one of the UK's greatest advantages, which is the ability it has to move money around to where it's most needed, that that is maintained and a more open system of ensuring that happens. All these things can be done through reform. It's important that we move to a system where the UK, and its own internal single market is governed not by Whitehall Dictat, but by consensual agreement. It's important that we have better intergovernmental machinery within the UK. At the moment, we have this body called the Joint Ministerial Council. We've been to this body. It mates every year, we go along, we shout at various ministers in Whitehall. They nod at us and say, we look at that and nothing happens. And the same thing happens the following year. It will be much more effective if we had a proper. body that could negotiate and come to agreements. A body that could say, right, we need to have common rules when it comes to agricultural subsidies in the UK. We need to have common rules when it comes to fisheries policy in the UK. We have common rules to make sure there are no barriers within the UK's own internal single market. It could do all that. And that's why I make the case, as I say, for reform rather than rupture. you could go further there are some who make the argument that the UK should not be a country where sovereignty rests at Westminster but where sovereignty rests with each of the four component parts of the UK and those component parts I say that is Northern Ireland is it a nation or not really that now in terms of a debate where they all have their own sovereignty and choose to pool that sovereignty in areas where it makes more sense borders and immigration defence, fiscal and fiscal and monetary union. There are so many models that can be looked at in terms of making sure that the UK works properly. Thank you very much indeed. You acknowledge some of the points that I made about promises that were made to the people of Scotland. But again, I'm sorry to say, and you're speaking too eloquently, you're doing exactly the same thing. The same old speeches we've heard again and again and again about how things can be made so much better if we just be patient and let them happen. It hasn't happened. And now in Scotland people can't feed their children or heat their homes. Timers are now on the union. Does the Scottish Government not have responsibility at all for any of those matters? Yes. I accept that many of the purse strings are held in Whitehall. But Scotland has tremendous flexibility when it comes to tax policy, much more than Wales has. Why doesn't the Scottish government say we want to deal with these problems, therefore we will increase taxes to make sure that we have the money to do so? That hasn't happened. So we have to get away from this situation where all blame lies in Westminster, and I'm no fan of the current UK government, but that there is no responsibility at all to be laid at the door of the Scottish government. Control exactly does the Scottish government have over energy bills in Scotland? the fuel poverty of a million Scots and energy-rich Scotland what control does the Scottish government pull up over the price of electricity in Scotland? No government has control over energy prices at the moment Vladimir Putin has made sure of that Putin's war Putin's war in Ukraine has seen energy I've done it was Putin's war in Ukraine has increased energy prices across Europe that's the reason why we have a situation where energy prices have gone up What we need, I've taken never a, what we need is not divorce, marriage counselling. We need that in the UK, but not divorce. What we need to make sure is that we see change that much is true. We need to make sure that we have a partnership of nations built on respect rather than hierarchy. We need to be proud of our different identities, but clothe that identity, clothe those identities in pragmatism and ultimately what we need is a government in London that understands, that listens, that sees the importance of distributing money across the UK, that respects devolution. But don't worry, next year, that government will arrive.
