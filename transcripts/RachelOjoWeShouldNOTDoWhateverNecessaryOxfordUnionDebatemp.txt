 I now look to my librarian Rachel Ojo to open the case for the opposition. Good evening everyone. everyone, I would like to begin by thanking the President Molly for the incredible opportunity to speak at such an interesting and important debate. I start my speech by looking at the motion more closely. What does whatever necessary mean? Doing whatever necessary means doing whatever one deems is required to promote a certain cause, to achieve a certain aim. This might relate to many social justice movements we've heard and seen over the past few years, including Black Lives Matter, the Uyghur crisis in China, discrimination faced by women in the workplace, and most recently, the deeply saddening invasion of Ukraine. This could also relate to one's personal life choices, doing whatever necessary to get a grade, to win an election, to secure a job. a concept that many union members here may be quite familiar with. But regardless of the end goal, it is crucial that we highlight the subjectivity of the words necessary. What is necessary, and when does necessary become too far? What I deem to be necessary is different from what you deem to be necessary and what you deem to be necessary. As humans, we are highly emotional, empathetic, in caring individuals. We are passionate about the causes we support, and I have full faith that us as individuals only have the best of intentions at heart. But this fire that burns inside us that makes us want to scream and shout, to take action immediately and often reckless actions, this is an emotional response that can lead us astray, and we find ourselves inadvertently causing more harm than good. Whatever necessary is the phrase that is used by someone who is desperate, who has gone beyond the point of reason, and who no longer thinks logically, who no longer considers these issues, clearly. Madam President and honoured members in the Chamber today, this is where I take a stand. This House should not do whatever necessary, because it is the opposition's belief tonight that this House has already committed to doing what is ethical, what is right and what is most effective. Yeah? I'm sure. A lot of the right of democracy or you know, as our trade for instance Nelson Mandela's rebellions and a high round of what may be is not necessarily progression in the case for our best. Thank you. As someone who actually interviewed Nelson Mandela's grandson this term, I believe that what Nelson Mandela did was important However, it can be the case where we cross a line. Before I continue more into that, I'd like to introduce the speakers on the proposition here tonight. First, we've just heard from Arben Nawaz, a second-year philosophy and theology student at Lady Margaret Hall, and our very own treasurer. Next, we will hear from Angeli Ramanathan, a second-year law student from Christchurch and the Union Secretary. We will also hear from Gian Fopichelli, a senior writer in Wired, covering cryptocurrency decentralisation, politics and technology regulation. And last but not least, our very own director of strategy, Matt Barrett, a second year at St John's College and someone who has brought a lot of strategy at this time of term. I'm sure a lot of people are calling him up. Madam President, these are your speakers. and they are of course, miss welcome. Now, even in relation to this question, peaceful protest has been used time and time again and has worked successfully to bring about change. Martin Luther King, a personal hero to me, used peaceful process in the civil rights movement and is celebrated till this day for his work. The issue with saying that we would do whatever necessary is that there is a fine line which we may end up crossing. When we cross the line in the name of a good cause, we may end up harming people we care about or even becoming worse than those we consider to be our oppressors. We cannot fight violence with violence. When fighting a cause you believe in, yes, we must give it to all, but we must remember not to sacrifice our morals and the values that we are campaigning for. in the first place. It is important to remember that you do not beat violence with violence and you do not beat violence by becoming violent yourself. With your permission? Yeah. So how do you define the line between self-defense and responding to violence and violence? Because there are some situations where it may very well be a case of having to either, for for example, kill or be killed. And I'm just curious to hear what your stance in that would be. Standing here on the opposition, it's not saying that some forms of violent protests haven't been allowed in the past. It's just saying there are extremes, and these extremes are places we don't want to be in as a society. You don't want to be fighting for justice in a way where you're violent in the human rights of your own people. This is not what we want, and this is not what we want to see on site. opposition. I would like to talk about Usha Mehta. Usha was a strident fighter for Indian independence. At the age of just eight, she joined other children in protesting against the Simon Commission. Together they chanted, policemen, you can wield your sticks and batons, but you cannot bring down our flag. At just 22, she joined the freedom movement full time, following Gandhi's principles of nonviolence. She began a radio station, Congress Radio. She broadcast messages from Gandhi and other key leaders. Each day they would move the station's location to escape the police and to escape detection. Finally, though, they were caught and imprisoned. Despite her incarceration in solitary confinement, Eusha never regretted her work, calling the radio her finest moment. The station provided vital support to people across India. When you choose which side to walk through today, members, please remember, Usha, someone who, despite being imprisoned, despite being prosecuted, still consistently did what was right and did not go to extremes, did not result in harming her own people just to achieve whatever was necessary. I'd like to end with these famous women. said by Gandhi, in a gentle way you can shake the world. Please remember this. Thank you.
