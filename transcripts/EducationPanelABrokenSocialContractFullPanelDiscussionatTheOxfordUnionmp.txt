 Thank you very much for during us this evening. Starting from you Jeff, would you like to introduce yourself and tell you a few words about who you are and why you're here to be? Yes, even here everyone. Real pleasure to be here. here. I was a head teacher for 15 years. Debating was my thing to former students of the school King Edwards are here tonight. So I know this place well. We used to bring our teams here when we got to Oxford finals. I'm here because I think education is one of the most important roles that we can play in society as the great sociologist whose name I've forgotten said, children are the living messages we live to a time we shall not see. Teachers will be teaching young people and preparing them for a world that we will not be around for and if we do it properly, they'll do a better job than the leaders we've got at the moment. I'm now am in charge of the Association of School and College leaders, 22,000 head teachers, deputy head teachers, etc. Thank you. Gary. Hey Michael, I'm Gary. Real pleasure to be here and excited to learn, not just from the panellists really, because we all bring different perspectives. So it's exciting to be here. So for me, education is I'm very much all about social mobility. So I grew up low income, single parent family, always less privileged check marks. A lot of my discussion around social mobility is around the career space, but you can't really talk about social mobility about having a conversation about education. So I'm really excited to kind of shine the light on that topic through this lens. For me, I have a lot of different perspectives on the topics, I'm sure the panelists do here, some of the things that really stand out when I'm thinking about education is around, and schooling and universities around career advice. I think career advice and schools needs a lot of improvement. It's actually circumscribing young people's potential, particularly those from lower SACOMO backgrounds. Contextual assessment is something that I have a fairly controversial kind of perspective one. I'd love to talk about that today with everybody and that international experience. So I spent two years working at the British Council where I was managing social mobility programs. Effectively what we did is we provided low income university students with funded work opportunities in China. And what you found was that when they went abroad and came back, their life experience had exploded, right? Their employability as well as their work experience had increased. And that directly impacted their opportunities in the workplace. So I thought that education isn't just something that's confined to the four walls of a classroom. It's a lived experience. And if we can bring international experience onto the curriculum or to give more opportunities to lower people from lower income backgrounds, travel, we'll see people really maximise their potential. So see Michael's taking some notes. So follow up. I can talk about that for days and looking forward to hearing for the rest of the whole. Thank you, Gary. Julie. Hello, everybody. It's lovely to be here. My name is Julie Taplin and I am Chief Executive of a charity called Potential Plus UK that most people probably have never heard of. But in 1967 there was a lady called Margaret Branch who was a psychiatric social worker and she recognised that there were a group of young people that had similar difficulties as those that have special educational needs. And together with a group of other people she founded the charity and she founded the charity and it was constituted as the National Association for Gifted Children. And almost at the first board meeting that they had, they had a discussion around have we chosen the best term for this organisation, for this charity. And so back in 2012, the charity decided to change its working name to Potential Plus UK. And we use the term high learning potential because we feel that it's important to highlight the fact that these young people have apt to have strengths, but it's also important that they have opportunities, that they develop resilience, that they are motivated, and so we want to try and ensure that that is encapsulated within the terminology that we use. We work primarily with parents and children themselves directly, sometimes with the schools, if it's a complex case. We have assessment services, advocacy services and advice services. I myself came to this charity over 17 years of to go looking for help and support with my own family. And 17 and a half years on, I'm chief executive with the responsibility of ensuring that it is still relevant to young people and families today and that it is economically and financially sustainable, which is not an easy task. What does education mean to me? I think it means above anything else, it means opportunity, an opportunity for all. Thank you so much, Julie. Next, Lee, would you like to? So I'm Lee Elliott Major. I am the countries, we think, the world's first professor of social mobility. And when people say that I'm one of the leading thinkers of social mobility, my 17-year-old daughter says, Dad, that's because you're the only professor of social mobility. There are, by the way, some amazing people in Oxford who are leading social mobility thinkers. I'm an associate of Nuffield College, and so to work with people like John Goldthorpew there. I'm the first in my family to go to higher education so is it a first generationer we call themselves now there's quite a lot of us now actually and I always say that when I speak because I think it is important to know the background you come from my story gets bigger every time I tell it actually but maybe we'll get into that later I was formerly formerly chief exec of the Sutton Trust which some of you probably will know some you might have benefited from actually even, which is all about improving access to highly selective universities. I think in terms of education, what is surprising, I guess, to people, that when I wrote the book, Social Ability and its Enemies, Penguin, in all good bookstores still to this day, I wish I'd bought some free copies actually with me. I'll do it next time. But in that book, we summarise the evidence on Social Mobility across the world. Social mobility is basically the chances of doing well in life compared compared with your parents. And I think one of the surprising findings in that was that education isn't the great social leveler that perhaps a lot of us would hope for. And in many ways, it's actually the vehicle through which social elites replicate themselves from one generation to the other. There's all sorts of reasons for that, which maybe we go into. But I think education is clearly transformative for many young people but for a number of reasons it hasn't lived up to those expectations of being the great social leveller. I'm sure we'll get into that in more detail as the debate goes on. So looking forward to it. Most definitely me. Thank you very much. Finally, Dennis. Hi, I'm Dennis Sherwood and I'm a campaigner. If I can just build on something Julie said. Julie said education is about opportunity, much endorsed by everyone else. Let me throw the word fair in, because I'm campaigning against a crime, a crime that is taking place at this very moment. A crime of a stupendous magnitude, which is claiming one and a half million victims now. What makes this the perfect crime is the fact that no No one knows that they are victims except very, very few. So they don't complain, so the perpetrator doesn't get arraigned and the perpetrator is free to commit the crime again the year after and the year after. The crime is the fact that in real exams, like the GCEs most of you would have taken before 2019 if you did English GCSEs, or the GCSEs and the GCSEs in the GCSEs and the GCSEs in the A levels that perhaps your brothers and sisters are sitting now. One grade in four is wrong. That does huge injustice to many, many people. If you've got three A stars and an A, you're probably annoyed about that A, but you still got in. It might have been an A star, especially if it was in history. That's at the top end. It's even worse at the bottom end. Jeff and Lee will talk about the forgotten third. This is a crime which does huge damage and destroys everything that everyone else is talking about. If we're going to have exams, which is a big question, the least you can expect is that the outcome is fair. It isn't. I'm campaigning. Please join the campaign. Thank you very much. You all join me in thanking our My panelist, great. Right, so the first question I want to throw out there to our panellist as someone who goes to a university which is rid of lots of exams is question whether the current education system in context of social mobility, whether our current system which is saturated with exams and school is entirely oriented towards a conducive good learning outcomes. Do we feel like what's people's thoughts on how exams and how we focus so much in exams, how what effect that has on students and learning outcomes that come off the standard A-plus or grade 8 you get in your exams? So we've got an examination system which is bloated over heavy. GCSE designed in a different era. GCSE was a groundbreaking qualification in its day. It was designed about 1988 or something. Up until that point, as an English teacher, what I had to do was to choose whether you were going to do O-level or CSE. I was therefore defining your life chances because CSE was generally seen as an inferior qualification. Suddenly with GCSE, everyone irrespective of background is doing the same qualification with the same grading system. Nice one. The trouble is it was designed in an era when 50% of kids were then leaving school and that was the end of it. Nobody's leaving school at 16 now. And yet, you'll know as well as I do that the average youngster at GCSCSA, is doing between 27 and 35 separate papers. It's madness, utter madness. And the best way of illustrating why there is a problem with it is what I said to the former school's minister just in the run-up to results day. And I said, what do you think it feels like, Minister, after 12 years of being taught by your primary teacher, your secondary teacher, that you go and get your English result, for example, and you get a grade three? What does that feel like, do you think? And he said, why do you fix eight on a grade three? I said because you fix eight on a grade four. You call a grade four a standard pass. So what does that make the grade three? To which his answer was? Presumably it's a good fail. That, I think, is disgusting. How would we possibly design a system where a third of young people, the forgotten third, Dennis was right, we were going to get them in there because we're not going to forget them, are written off. And year after year after year, there will be a forgotten third. because grades are held around the same level. So although we can talk about all the A stars and all of you people who benefit from education, if you get to grade three, you will never go into a six-form college, you will go to an FE college where you will be in a treadmill of retakes, you can't become a social worker, you can't become a teaching assistant, you won't become a police man or woman. We have to do better than that. And that means having a look particularly at GCSE and putting a greater sense of proportion into it it so that I am not defined by the grade. It's a reflection of who I am and what I can do more broadly. That felt like school assembly then, didn't know? No, no, no, quite. Don't be a teacher. You'll be in detention. Gary, you mentioned earlier on this concept of contextual assessments. And that kind of links on to, first I'd like you to elaborate on what that is. Sure, sure. But also respond to your thoughts on currently at Oxford. just instituted this scheme called Foundage in Oxford, which effectively allows for people from backgrounds that do not tend to come to the University of Oxford to be facilitated in doing so. There's like a big focus on ensuring that the students are able to thrive in this environment before they do come to study here. And I would want to get your thoughts on that and whether you think that's a movement forward or maybe that doesn't quite match the way to tackle the state of school. Sure. So I'll just, I'll start with the contextual assessment. Maybe remind me your second question after. So my thoughts on contextual assessment might be a bit controversial in some ways, but oh well. I think that, so we understand what contextual assessment is, right, depending on the kind of socio-economic context that you're born in, you might get a, you know, a reduced offer or off-offer at Oxford or Cambridge. You might be like strongly recommended to for an interview, right, depending on what postcode you're in and so forth. And I think that's good. Absolutely, I'm a proponent of that. But what I also think is that that is a clear admission that the understanding that the kind of the socioeconomic context that you're born into has a bearing on your educational achievement, right? So my thinking is why do we stop there? Why do we not apply that same kind of mentality to the higher end in the sense that if I did go to one of the private Clarendon schools and my parents are professional managerial kind of occupational status, doctors, lawyers, etc. I had all the private tuition, all the extracurricular activities thrown at me. Why, if we kind of adjust the offer that we give to people based on this, so you can look, background at the bottom end, why do we not adjust the offers that we give people at the top? And look, I think if we're looking at equity in our educational system, the uncomfortable troopers, equity also means that for some people it's going to be harder, and that's oftentimes people that are already in positions of privilege. I know that I think Oxford's standard offer is three A's. I think there's a handful of courses that are two I stars in A, a few others are A-starchal-A, but then most of them, at least from what I looked at online, most of them are three-A offers, right? So I think if I came from the higher and I have all this support, you know, how can I be offered three eights? I mean, I went to a bog standard understaffed, under-resolved, you know, state school, and I got three-eights. I mean, if I went to one of the better schools, and surely that should be adjusted to the kind of the economic consequences. I mean, so I think we should broaden out the contextual assessment, contextual offer perspective to the higher end, just as much as we apply it to the bottom end, that will make things harder. But I think it brings equity into our educational system. That's amazing. My second off my question was highlighting how in Oxford there is a version of that that does exist, but an additional element of allowance. If you're on the foundation of Oxford programme, for example, you're able to spend a year, almost like on a foundation year version of your degree before you go on to apply to sit the full degree. Or if you're on an opportunity program, you may be offered, it may be admitted on a lower offer, but also given a month in advance prep. to cope with the Oxford environment or at least a little traditional period based on the fact that the true didn't have any people there I just wonder whether you think that's a good way to tackle the gaps yeah it's an interesting I think yeah as much accessibility we can give to people that have the potential it might and be have had the right kind of circumstances to sharpen that potential that's great I think kind of the thing comes to mind is me just making sure what those people that do come into Oxford or any other university that's at the higher end of the the rankings, but they don't feel lesser than coming through these and other means. And that's oftentimes that feeling you've come from a socialist, but I'm not sure what we can do on that front. But I am a proponent of them. I do think they're good. As just making sure that people feel that they still have come in, if they do go from that foundation year and then they join the kind of the standard course that they've done that on merit, they haven't been given a handout if you like. So that would be my kind of initial thoughts on that. Thank you very much. If anyone else has anything to add on that. I'm probably leaving might have something. On the foundation year or on the, well, I think they're a good thing. I just think they're small numbers, right? Is it, what, 50 students at Oxford? When it began, there was like eight students from a particular college. I think all the time it's expanding out to probably 50 and then hopefully expand more as the decades increase. Yeah, I think they're a good thing. They're a good thing, but they're very small. in terms of numbers, right? And so I think it's good for the people that get on those schemes. And I think the results have been really positive, right? I think people have moved into Oxford and Cambridge just got one. It must be great if Cambridge is now following Oxford on this, right? I do worry about the government cutting possibly the fees around foundation years. I think foundation years for access are a good thing, but there's a wider debate about foundation years more generally as a sort of cash generation, you know, strategy for many universities. But generally, I think they're a good thing. On contextual admissions, I mean, you know, I've proposed me, I'm just seeing Nick Hillman over that. I think he allowed me to put in one of his heppy reports, a proposal to actually have randomized admissions over a certain threshold, because I think that's simpler. So, so I would, I would say, a lottery, over a certain grade, because one, as Dennis was saying, I'm not convinced actually by a lot of grades. We know that what you get on the day of the exam can be slightly random as well as what you're talking about. But actually, you know, I know in Oxford you have lots of bespoke admissions tests very unproven in terms of what they show in terms of degree outcomes. I mean, you know, I'd love to see more evidence around how effective those exams are. You know, I think there's a lot of what I would call hyperselectivity in Oxford and other highly selective institutions. I would prefer to have a basic threshold that says, maybe it might be three A's here, I don't know, it might be two A's and a B. Everyone who gets that is probably going to be able to do okay here. Then I would have some sort of weighted lottery. I would have it waited to emphasize those from less privileged backgrounds, but this is probably never going to happen, of course. But it's the only way, I think, that you wipe away middle class advantage. Nick probably will come back on me on this when we're going to the wider debate, because it's one of the few things that we disagree on, I think. But anyway, that I would be more radical. I'd go for lotteries. Thank you. I think, obviously, so far, we've tied to focus more on the Oxbridge system. I thought maybe from the potential plus perspective, Julie, whether what you'd think of the fact that whether we need to redesign or reshape the way we're looking at how to forge a new socially equitable educational system, do we need to go back to history lessons on social mobility, or do we need to like forge a new, entirely new system to create more opportunities for not just people who go into university, but generally people who have potential? I think we need to consider what do we mean by potential. And also I would pick up on what do we mean by, you know, education and the fact that you were saying before about the fact that it isn't necessarily education that improves social mobility. It's made me consider when I, my formative years were spent in Germany, I did languages at a university. And they had and still have an education system whereby if you have strengths in areas other than academics, you have opportunities to go through the education system and still go on to, I think you would call it a faculty schula, so an University of Applied Sciences, that kind of idea. So you're not, young people aren't being limited early on at GCSE or any other time in going down a highly academic route. It isn't the only option for them to try and improve their social mobility, basically. And when I think about apprenticeships in Germany as well in Austria, they are valued. I think that's where we perhaps fall down here in the UK. but we don't seem to value these kind of practical skills. And when I think about Germany and Austria, people who've gone through an apprenticeship and have practiced their craft for many years, they are described as being master carpenters and master plumbers. When did you describe a plumber as being a master plumber? So I'm just trying to get across the idea that it isn't just academics that actually leads to social mobility. And within Germany, as well, well they've got this whole middle stand which are the companies the kind of the medium-sized companies which um provide almost like a backbone for the for the industry in in germany and again that's highly prized and so i know we're talking about academics in oxbridge but i do think we're we are limited we limit ourselves in our thinking and i i feel we need to find as far as assessment is concerned and qualifications i think we need to find better ways that of actually measuring, we have to measure, I guess, but assessing the abilities and strengths of young people that actually give them opportunities to be able to go on and access education and life and experiences and opportunities that are suitable for them but aren't devalued in any way by the rest of society. I don't know if I actually answered your question there. No, no, definitely. I think that probably most of us on the table agree that not all students benefit from the academic routes in comparison to those who would probably very well itself. But I do think that it's important for universities like Oxford and Cambridge and actually others as well to ensure that there is a mechanism, a structure that helps young people fit in to the kind of academics and study that they're going to have to do. One thing that I think is hugely lacking in school education per se is the opportunity for problem solving and looking at solutions creative and critical thinking I know it's a kind of thing that we're all interested in but the focus becomes if we're not careful on getting somebody through an exam but how well does that then prepare them for what they then go on to as well as within within Oxbridge as well and so if If we do still have a system whereby we are focusing on just getting young people, mainly getting young people through exams, then I feel universities need to then step in and be able to provide something that helps young people to adapt from the way that they've been learning to how they need to learn at university. I just want to comment on that, but also Gary's point, how far can assessment system sort social mobility? Actually, education needs to sort social mobility as best we can. And I think the point I would make is what we do distinctively in the UK but particularly in England within the UK is that when you get your GCSE grade we use it to tell you how you've done we use it to judge the teacher we use it to judge the head teacher we use it to judge the school if the school doesn't do well then the school will be sent into an academy trust and in my first year in this job five years ago on results day GCSE results day three head teachers lost their job in the east of England because the results weren't good here's the killer they had started in the September before. So the stakes are incredibly high. Now you can see what that then leads to. It might be that I don't want him in my school because he's not going to get great results. And therefore at the moment the system puts it in my interest to say to him either formally or informally or say to his parents, there's a school which is much better at special aid stuff around the corner. They've got loads of space. And if you stay at our school, you might get bullied. There is some unethical stuff which has been going on, but the system drives all of that because we use assessments for far too many different reasons it seems to me. Geoff, does that kind of kind of lead on to the whole off-rolling kind of discussion that's going on at present for special education needs students? Yeah, so off-rolling is where a young person disappears. There are now, in this country, 100,000 young people who are not in education, they may be being home-educated, they may be not, they may be in gang culture and that kind of thing. It's a scandal. And at least what we've got in the white paper, in the Queen's speech now, is every child will be very child will be registered. Now some parents won't like that but at least we will start to find out where they are. But the bigger point is that instead of it being in my interest that you're not in my school and you show up on someone else's results, what we would suggest as a trade union is what if you show up on my results whether you're in my school or the school next door, that you have shared accountability, inclusive accountability, because it might be that you would be better being in a pupil referral unit down the road, but that doesn't mean that my responsibilities have been lost there. And I think we have would move towards a much more ethically minded sense of trying to get an education provision for every child which is appropriate. And just beware the trap, by the way, of thinking that for some young people they should never be doing academics, they should only be doing vocational stuff. That way takes us into a terrible problem around social mobility if we start prejudging like the CSE and OLAVOR did. I will shut up now. No, no, we'll identify a couple of issues which centre around how there are people who fall through certain cracks through our current education system and those who use the highlights that are needs those who might not be in education employment or training and we noted that for some recreational routes could be beneficial for some the early years training and the soft skills had not equipped them to progress on how can we fix that and whose burden is that on is that on the government is that on families is that on schools to say that I've become more dictator-like with my views on social mobility. One of the reasons I say that is you bring up a really interesting issue. You know, at the beginning of school, age five, we know that there's already a 19-month gap between the poorest children and the, I become more and more convinced that we need to have a national debate about parenting in this country and that there are many children that are born in a household, and that there are many children that are born in a house, houses, homes where they will not be read to, for example, or shared with a book shared with them or help. And, you know, we know that is one of the big drivers of low achievement in school. Schools can only do so much, you see, I think, and even though they're held to account on everything, the problem with that is a very politically sensitive discussion right now. I've pleaded with officials and ministers to think about, and I have to say, Jeff, you probably, how schools might help with this as well and I do think there's we do want to burden schools with too much but unless we get in a national debate about how we expect a certain sort of home learning environment in in houses across the country we're not going to address these issues I'm afraid so as I'm not saying we could tell parents what to do but I think we could help more parents in terms of the sort of skills you're talking about because if they come to school without unprepared to learn that the teachers can only do so much And by the way, during the COVID pandemic, we really did show, it really did expose the inequalities in society. Children turning up not being fed properly, not being able to learn. So, so I think something about parenting in the home, we have, in terms of learning, I think we have to get into that debate. So yeah, so there's lots of other things I would do, but I think I would start there. As a, can I just comment? So as a charity that works with parents primarily, I can see on a day, basis that parents need help and support about how to best support their child. I mean, inevitably, the parents and carers that have come into us have sought us out. So they've recognized that they've got a concern of some sort that their child struggling in some way. And so they seek us out and they seek help and support. And part of that is actually giving them information, information so that they can, we talk a lot about parental modeling so that they're not just saying to their child what their child should be doing that they're actually modelling themselves. So things like dealing with perfectionism perhaps or being solution focused, all of those kind of things that we were asking parents to actually model that so that their child can see it. Now those are the parents that are coming to us. Inevitably how do we reach then those parents who aren't coming to us and the only way we as a small charity can do that at present is through schools because then we actually open up all of our support to to those parents through the school. Yes that's why I like schools. I mean every program I've seen it has the same challenge. It's the parents that come to you that are probably the ones that don't need the most help. That's the problem. By the way the other thing as a dictator I'd say is every student at Oxford should tutor a disadvantaged pupil in a school somewhere properly trained with some credit for that I think everyone here should give back I don't think we have enough of that in this country so that would be another thing there's a lot of more things I'd have on my list but that's one more yeah I'm really keen to get on to questions from the floor really quickly but I just want to follow up on this discussion because I think it's quite interesting so far we identified elements in which perhaps home could be ways in which we can try to address this obviously is a much more tricky thing to do but the state of school does see cuts to schools. The school does see as with limited systems whereby teachers are not really incentivised to properly spend time to develop a child, but to follow metrics and take stuff along. And that comes from government sort of like mandates and so on. Secondly, there is an issue whereby at present this pressure on institutions at Oxford and the Russell Group University to try to level up inequality at a stage where someone's 18 years old and the arm was probably done while I'm in primary and secondary school. My question more directly is that if you guys were in government today of the highlighted detector of what you do in that regard what could you do to the system that you think could redress issues we have in social mobility and whether it be funding whether it being focused or whether it would be much more of the contextual assessments and and the things we spoke up before I think we've seen evidence of youth services and Breffields and previous governments helping improve literacy across across the country, what would you suggest currently if you were in government? Is this for me? Dictator. Okay, another thing I would do as dictator would be, obviously I'd have to get voted in to always, but I probably would have a wealth tax. You know, we just had a Sunday Times rich list. Did you see it? I mean, there is huge wealth in this country. I don't, you know, if we tax them just a little bit more, it would generate a lot of money and it wouldn't hurt them hardly at all. I was really shocked at the lack of giving. If you look at the Sunday Times rich list, the amount of wealth that's accrued over the last year and the lack of actual philanthropy among those riches in society, I think is outrageous. So probably at the top of this would be some wealth redistribution and that would have to be used very effectively. And there's lots of debates we could have about that. Probably one of the things would be early years provision in this country. There are family hubs. I think we need more of them. So yeah, I would start with that and there are some things that I've said already. But I think you have to be realistic. We have to generate some funding. It's not all about money, by the way. It's not all about money. I think a lot of things that universities could do isn't necessarily about money. But that certainly would help, I think, earlier on in the pipeline, if you like. If I could add onto that. So kind of going back to what I mentioned around international experience, I think when you talk about it seems quite facetious, oh, travel aboard, gap, yeah. But it really does have like a tremendous. tremendous impact, particularly for the underrepresented groups. So as I mentioned, I was at the British Council, we provided low-income students with those kind of international experiences abroad. And every single time, almost every single time, a young person would have come back from there, two months in China, whatever it was, their personal development through the roof, majority of our alumni were in employment set three months after they graduated. Like it did just change. Obviously, you can't say it's like completely like, you're putting a quotation or whatever, but it does have an effect. UUK.I, so that's universities, UK international, our educational body encourages international experiences, they've done a huge body of research on this and they found that graduates or students that are mobile during their studies, they experience much higher personal development, they're way more likely, they're more like to get a first class degree and they're more likely to or less likely to be unemployed after university. So there's something about going abroad, going to a different country where the language is different, that just kind of stretches you and makes you think very differently. What we also found in that research is a body of research that finds that actually when you have an international experience kind of before, university there's a certain effect that international experience has on your kind of international curiosity and your cultural awareness that actually lends well to sustained engagement with the educational system so I've gone abroad I've seen this place I actually want to continue to learn more about this place actually will spend more time in the educational system so if I was the Tsar or DFE if you're like what I would make it I would make it so that every single student particularly those lowest students who are backgrounds have at least two weeks of international experience before they leave school at 16 for all those reasons that I mentioned but it actually keeps you in the educational system It keeps you interested in learning and actually gets us, gets more people kind of through. So that's one thing I would make. February really, Dennis, from your companion background, is there any comments you'd like to add? Yeah, I mean there are many, so I'll keep it pretty brief. And firstly, what we've been hearing is really powerful stuff. Jeff, everything that you were saying about, the really vicious nature of exams and the way everything is geared to that, we've talked about grades and exams so much within this. We have to break out of that. That's not because exams are necessarily bad. The best exam I ever did was actually at Yale, where they gave me the exam paper at 5 o'clock on a Friday. They said, give it back at 9 a.m. on the Monday and do what you like. I could have spoken to Nobel Prize winners about it if I wanted to. That was a really good test of me, because I had to look in the right places, and I had to read the right things, had to think quite fast. So I would respect that as an assessment of me as an exam as part of everything else as well. So a lot of this technically is about totally, totally changing curriculum, the objectives of what schools are there to do and the way in which assessment occurs. Now that's within a school environment. The point is about what happens in a family. I mean, we've all grown up in families. I am now, you know, the parent of grown-up kids, so I've, you know, played my part or got it right or got it wrong. And I'm sure Lee, what you were saying about so many parents who just don't read a book to their kids or who are, you know, just incapable of doing that because they got failed by the education system they went through. It's really deep. So somehow or another, we've got to get right into the structures and do something which is really, really long to. really long term. This is generational. But you do it one step at a time. So we need to get a government in place that actually has a good belief in doing the right thing which transcends the cycle of elections. So it's not just a government, it's in society. But some easy things to do now. Scrap GCSE. We don't need it. As Jeff said it was designed, you know, in 19 1988 or whatever it was. It's different now. Start influencing the curriculum to different things. Unhook all of that muddle that Jeff mentioned about complex interconnected performance measures. You cannot have something that judges you and at the same time your school. At the same time the education policies of the government. That's what GCSDs do. Get rid of the. And of course I'm back into campaigning about the first thing you do is at least make grades reliable. Let me just add a number to what Jeff was saying about the forgotten third. Something to think about. That grade three in English is an absolute killer. In 2019, GCSE English had about 700,000 candidates. If you look at the numbers, about 170. 70,000 of those got grade three. There were more grade threes than any other single grade. Can you believe that? What the hell is a good fail? Of those 170,000 that got grade three, 30,000, I'm not making this up, would have got a four or a five if their script had been marked. by someone else. So 30,000 kids ended up in that forgotten third unfairly. How many undergraduates are there in this great institution? 30,000 is a big number but they don't know their victims. As I say, the perfect crime that needs to be fixed. Just a quick quick comment just to pull that together. Notice what what you've got on the panel here, including someone who is a trade union leader, is higher expectations than a government with an 80-seat majority, who basically are giving us a white paper which is utterly managerial. Every school is going to be part of a multi-academy trust. Where is the ambition around all of that? Now, what I would be saying to ministers is we've got a good education system. You exemplify it. But the reason you exemplify it is people taught you the stuff you needed to know, the skills you needed, and they gave you opportunities to develop other attributes. If you were playing in an orchestra, it wasn't because you were necessarily going to become a professional musician, but it gave you that cultural insight, the discipline and all the other stuff. Kevin Collins, when he was appointed as the catch-up commissioner, suggested every child should be able to after school have access to the arts, to sport, to tutoring. It was an extraordinary moment when we could have said that the things the middle classes pay for, we will now, as a government, bangs on about leveling up, make available for everyone. And he resigned, government would not match it. We are exemplifying greater ambition than a government with 80 seats. Shame on them. Shame on them. Thank you so much for that. I'm keen to open up to the floor for any questions from anyone. Please just raise your hand up high and I'll point to you in the mic will come to you. So I recognize a member with a brown jacket. Could you wait for the Mike. Hi, I'm Alex. And my question that I'd like to ask is basically around entrance exam, since it seems like so much has revolved around that subject for this conversation. But basically, if you could wave your magic wand and get rid of entrance exams entirely in a perfect world, would you do that or do you think that there is a place for that? Can we do better? I mean, I don't think, I mean, I'd be interested in other people's views. The problem with saying you want to abolish exams, I just don't think that's realistic or doable, so I think you do have to have some entrance exams. I would simplify it, as I said, probably have some sort of lottery system of highly selective institutions. I mean, I do disagree a little bit with, I mean, the problem with this panel, we're all agreeing with each other. I think if you allow people to go away for a weekend to do exam, the problem I would have with that is it will be middle-class parents just like me who would help their children do it and therefore it's open to unfairness. So there are strength to having an exam where you sit down. Now there are also, Dennis is absolutely right, there are all sorts of issues with that but I do think you have to have some way of assessing that but I would probably have that as one element I guess but I think it's a good question because we are circling around that that discussion. I don't know what other people would think. Yeah I would agree with that. I wouldn't be scrapping GCSEs and I think there is a sense of needing externality. We saw it through the pandemic. Young people wanted to be able to demonstrate that it wasn't just the favoritism of their teacher that gave them the grade. They will demonstrate against an examiner. The trouble is it's disproportionate how much examination we get. Now, if what you had was something in English and maths akin to the driving test, right? And basically you sit in front of that and it shows you whether you can or you can't do your basics in English and maths. You could do it at 14. it you could just keep doing it because if you've taken your driving test five times we don't think you're a worse driver than if you passed it the first time you've basically demonstrated it now if you did that at 14 and every child can demonstrate in literacy and numeracy here's what I can do that would clear the way for the next four years for them to do a mix of technical vocational and academic as appropriate and to end up at 18 with a kind of passport sorry a portfolio saying I've got some qualifications but I've also got other stuff that shows who I am and what I can do. That would seem to me a grown-up assessment system recognising that we are not just the sum of the grade that we are given. I like that very idea very much because in a lot of the young people that we work with actually could take exams and do take exams much earlier. Some of them are the ones that you end up then seen in the newspapers and what having the sensationalism around them but there are a lot that are capable of doing things earlier. That would then give them the opportunity to to widen their skills base. You know, sometimes parents focus on the fact that they would like their children to kind of go quicker through the content in schools. And one of the things that we try and speak to them about is it's not just about going through the content, it's also about making sure that they develop their skills along the way. And I think that would give them an opportunity. I would say, though, I think parents focus on that going through the content because that's what they see from school and school isn't and is it necessarily saying to them and we also want to develop these skills. I think if school was saying we want to make sure we develop skills like problem solving and creative and critical thinking, all those different things as well, I think parents would be much more open to that and we find one of the things we have to do is to kind of educate our parents that they need to be open to those kind of ideas as well. So I think if a child had the opportunity to do some assessments early, but also at the same time have the opportunity to develop almost like a profile, a learner profile of themselves as well where they can try different things and explore different avenues. I think that would be a very good idea. Let's do that. Get the dictator on, sir. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, I disagree with Gary as well, one thing as well. Here we go. I think social mobility, we have to really care for, sorry Dennis, you're going to come in on it, but you know, I wouldn't bring down grades at the very top end but I think it would just cause such a protracted divisive debate I think you have to level up and I know that's an expression that now has been you know bastardized in some ways but I think you know so for entrance exams for highly selective institutions like this I do think you know that's why I was begging you all to be to help tutoring because I think there we know that there has this been boom in private tutoring outside schools which is fueled by middle classes like me actually paying for their children's extra tutoring. So I would argue those grades are as much a function of how much support you get in family as potential, however we define that. So I think I want to level up in that sense. I think everyone should get access to tutoring and hopefully those gaps, but limiting those people at the very top so they don't, I don't know. I'm anxious, it would cause such division that I'm not sure that you would get overall support for that. thought experiment if I may, how can you have a process which actually distinguishes between two important things which at the moment are muddled? It's another variety of the muddle that Jeff was talking about in terms of what a GCSE or an A level grade means. There's something which actually talks about me and what I am capable of. Can I pass the driving test? Can I do simultaneous equations? Have I I read Hamlet. There's something else which is, is it Lee or me who should be given the great privilege of coming to a college here? Now at the moment those two are muddled. How do we unmuddle those and maybe the solution is looking somewhere else, instead of having me and Lee in competition for a lovely place here, if we're both in principle eligible, What do we do about the capacity here so that we're no longer in competition? And at the moment, all of these things are gamished up. Let's untangle them. Thank you, Dennis. I've got time for one more question. I recognise the member with the red band on her hand. Hi, so obviously this has been wonderfully inspiring and there's a lot of food for thought there. I was wondering then how you begin to instill that into schools, the notion that students deserve better. Having back at home, having my local secondary school closed down because of one in three students, actually having a passing grade in both English and maths, two out of three students did not gain both English and maths, and it was closed down as a result of that. How do you begin to tell these students who have kind of that culture of anti-education, how do you begin to tell them that they do deserve better? I think there's a point with English and maths that whether you, if you've got a grade B or grade seven, let's say, in English at GCSE, what's that telling us? Because English is actually an English literature qualification, really. So why don't we redesign English and also maths? I don't know how much maths you've used today. I haven't used a lot of maths. Now I understand that maths is going to help me to be a more analytical thinker and all that kind of stuff. Trouble with maths GCSE, it tries to cover far too much, far more than in other countries. So you could do some redesigning of what is the basic qualification. Because I would want to start, if I was Education Secretary, I would be saying what would we need to do for every child in our country to have the dignity of being able to say in the basics of English the basics of maths, I can do something and that then clears the way for all the rest of it. I think that is doable, genuine. You can see from the responses of people we have to do better. That then allows us with young people to be able to focus on the range of skills and qualities and digital passport where they can say, here's what I can do, video clips, testimonials from people I've raised money for, all of that would put the humanity back and you all know as well as I do that. The best of our schools are the most humane places. We need every school, particularly particularly in the most disadvantaged area, to see it's in their interest to do that, rather than just chasing grades, which sometimes the accountable system pushes them to do, I think. I mean, I'd agree that, you know, we should have some threshold, you know, qualification in all schools, which is functional literacy and numeracy. I agree with you on that, Jeff. I think you'd have to have to have a certain standard there. So, you know, that everyone does have to pass a certain standard, but I think it has to, but I would say back to you on this is that, you know, you could have the most teachers in that school but if things aren't happening in the home learning environment then I think you're always going to be up against it and that is from zero well from you know conception onwards and I think that's why I was saying earlier if I'm realizing I'm not going to be able to be prime minister because of course I didn't go to Oxford because every English Prime Minister since the war who you know went to university went to one institution Oxford that's not Gordon Brown of course he was Scottish she went to Edinburgh but anyway so so So, maybe a czar, you were talking about being a czar, maybe that's the thing I, but anyway, I think that's why I come back to the home learning right. And I think everyone's made good points about assessment and, but for me, when I look at my research, time and time again, there is this huge factor and no one wants to discuss it because it's too sensitive, I feel, is that that home background shapes young children's lives. And I think we need a national about how we help those parents, not tell them what to do, but help them so that when their children do begin at school, they've got a chance. At the moment, I don't think they have a chance. They're losing a race before it's even begun. I know that we've reached our mark and I'm just hoping to ask one more question, hopefully to Gary and Julie to respond to. One thing that's been missing from this debate is the effect of the mentor aspect to students. I mean, recent research has shown that many students are having the highest level of depression and social anxiety and a lot of it tends to them having stress with exams and so on. I wonder what your response to sort of like recognize what why this could be and perhaps what effect has has for education and social mobility in the context of the high pressure exam driven environment that people are coming from. It's interesting isn't it that we run courses and opportunities for children and families to come together to meet each other it's about having social interactions with like-minded peers and about developing skills etc but over the last six months we've started to run courses to help young people deal with build strategies for dealing with anxiety and that's the first time we've done that in our 55 year history and that's that's remarkably sad and unfair for a lot of young people so what do we see we see a lot of young people actually and it's not just about exams, it's about anxiety about going back into school. So there's also school phobia that we're dealing with at present. Also young people who have been able to work at their own pace at home during lockdown. I know for a lot of young people that the whole lockdown situation meant that they fell behind. But there were also some young people who actually found it liberating, I suppose, in a way, in that they were able to work at their own pace, on topics where they found interesting. And interestingly, I was looking at some data because we have a helpline. And in the six months up to the end of 2021, six and a half percent of the questions that were coming up on our helpline were about home education. If you compare that with 18 months ago, it was only 1.5%. So obviously, there is a movement there as well. And I think part of that is around parents' children. trying to accommodate for their children and I take on board that a lot of those parents will be middle classes and so as far as anxiety is concerned stresses about exams etc we've actually just released a webinar on that to help parents deal with that but i think it's about what i would like to see is an opportunity for young people to be able to take as jeff was saying before exams at an age when they're ready for it almost i would be very keen to see something about stage rather than age but no but then to be able if they didn't get whatever grade they needed to have the opportunity to go and take that again a little bit like the driving test and I think that would reduce the stress and the anxiety that people young people feel of having to pass that I'm 16 now I've got to pass that then when I'm 18 I've got to pass that then I'm going to university and I'm doing that we've got this it's this frontal effect almost that I think we're really pushing young people down and if we could just loosen that a little bit I think that would be helpful. Thank you. Any final comments? Gary? So can you complete the question? Just so far we've talked about other aspects that put pressure and and failures for social media education. One thing we're not spoken about is the effect of mental health and welfare and there's increasing evidence that many students are at least reporting on having more stresses and anxieties and mental health struggles whilst in school and exams as being a number one factor in that. How can we tackle that? basically. Oh, it's a big question. Yeah, I wish I, I think, um, don't know. When I look at some of, just reflecting some of the people that I know of, let's say struggle for mental health experiences, not just from school, but also from university, I think there's a, there's almost like a disparity between getting education and knowing what to actually do with education in the sense that I've like two of my best friends, but over to very good universities, Ellison and Bristol and they were just very much, their ethnic minorities as well, which is something to point out. And when you come from an ethnic background, we're very much told she's like just study, study, study. There isn't really any kind of focus or emphasis on like extra-curricular activities playing an instrument. Just like read your book and get good grades. And so we do that and then we go to university and we think that life's just going to open up for us and have all these opportunities. But actually, because we haven't focused on all the other, the other aspects of education, which is travel, which is playing a sport and so forth, we're actually we meet the labour market without the skills and experience that employees actually want so for example my two best friends or two friends were they graduate from university they were one of them was on job seekers for you know for a prolonged period of time one was unemployed for 18 months because it just couldn't get a job they didn't know how to navigate the labour market how to show up for employees and that obviously had a massive effect on their mental health their anxiety and like depression for example so I think there's there's one thing about kind of going through the education system getting the grades and so forth and the effect that has but also it's like how to actually use the education system so that when you're when you're going into the labour market you're best prepared to actually meet it and maximize your potential in that sense so it would be some things like on that. Thank you so much and thank you so much for joining us today and giving us such insightful views on how we could tackle social mobility through the lens of education. Would everyone join me and thank you our panelists for joining us today? I'm
