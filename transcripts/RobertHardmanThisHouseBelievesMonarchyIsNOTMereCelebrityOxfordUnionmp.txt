 Finally, it falls upon me to invite onto the stage to close the case for the opposition, British journalists at the Daily Mill and a recent biographer of the royal family, Robert Hardman. Thanks very much, Mr. President, and thank you everybody for being here this evening. We've heard great points on both sides of the debate tonight, I think. And rather like my opponent, Dr. Eli, I come here tonight principally taking issue with the word mere. I think there's no question that monarchy has a connection with celebrity it goes without saying but it's a byproduct of monarchy celebrity comes with the institution the system of monarchy is one that this country has been broadly happy with with the exception of a sort of tenure headless hiatus about 350 years ago as it has been discussed but on the whole the large, long majority of people in this country are entirely happy with the system of constitutional monarchy which is why no political party will go anywhere near it and I think to say that monarchy is all about celebrities is about like saying that the oxford union is all about dressing up in this sort of kit I mean it sort of goes with the territory but it's not what it's about so I emphatically say monarchy is not about celebrity now you probably think that's probably a bit rich coming from a daily mail hack particularly one who actually is on the on countdown tomorrow sitting in the celebrity chair. So I, you know, full interest declared. But I, as well as writing for the paper, I write books, I write documentaries. A few years ago, I wrote another book and interviewed Prince William about the Queen. And he came up with a very good point, I thought, where he said, talking of the Queen, he said, she cares not for celebrity, that's not what Monarchy is about. And it really is the case. I mean, royals don't do stunts. The Queen absolutely hates stunts. I mean, this is the Queen who once on being presented with a draft copy of a speech, which began with the line, I'm very glad to be back in Birmingham, crossed out the word very on the grounds. There was no disrespect to Birmingham, but she somehow felt that it smacked of insincerity. Probably the only stunt that she has done, and we've all seen it, it was a great one. It wasn't really a stunt. I mean, it was a very important moment, was her appearance in that spoof video with James Bond to open the 22. 12 Olympics. I happen to be in the stadium that night writing about it. I can tell you I was surrounded by thousands of journalists from all over the world who were all frankly a bit baffled by Danny Boyle somewhat eccentric though brilliant stagecraft and then suddenly oh god for that there's James Bond as the Queen, we get it. And that the next day that was headlines around the world it wasn't London Olympics open it was Queen jumps out of helicopter with James Bond so going back to the celebrity point I mean yes thank you Mr President I've just written the Queen's biography. I won't even name. I won't plug it. I think it's in some blackwolds. But in the course of writing this, I was able to talk to half a dozen of her prime ministers, presidents, people who work with her, people all around the world. She gave me access to some of her papers, her father's diaries. And I think if you really want to understand her, read her father's diaries. I was also lucky enough to use freedom of information, legislation to dig out some classified documents, not least fascinating one on the 1982 visit by President Reagan. I think it's really interesting because here's Reagan, newly elected president of the United States and a celebrity, let's not forget, film star, governor of California, boy, is he a celeb. He's coming to Europe for the first time as president, and it's a really big trip because he's coming to a NATO summit, he's coming to a G7 summit, he's going to meet the Pope at the Vatican. He's coming to address both houses of Parliament. But what this file I managed to get my hands on shows very clearly, and you read all the diplomatic traffic between Washington and London and Downing Street and the Palace, the thing that matters more to the White House, more to Reagan than anything else on this entire trip is riding in Windsor Park with the Queen. That's what really matters. And don't forget, at this very moment, Britain is at war in the South Atlantic with Argentina over the Falkland Islands. We need America on side. So you really really, you really can draw an absolute line between Queen, Reagan, ally and the victory that was soon to follow. Now, I mean, that is a form of power that we've talked a lot tonight about power and what powers the Queen does and doesn't have. We haven't touched on what I think is her key power, and that is soft power. We live in the age of soft power where influence and charm and persuasion are far more important than coercion. You can get a lot more done by winning people around than by driving people around than by driving. tanks across their lawn. And I, in the course of this book, I interviewed a great man, Professor Joe Nye of Harvard University, the man who invented the concept of soft power. And he was absolutely clear about this. He said Britain's two number one soft power assets are the English language and the monarchy, and specifically the queen. And I think Richard referred to her state visit to Ireland. I happened to be on that trip in 2011. It wasn't that long ago. I mean, We've talked about things in the past, and it's all a long time ago. No, the visit to Ireland was really, really quite recent. And it was an astonishing bit of statecraft, and it was absolutely soft power with bells on, reset the dial completely. And what it showed was that sense of permanence, that sense of continuity that the monarchy brings, that the Queen brings. She did more in those four days in Ireland, I can tell you, than politicians that in the previous 40 years to reset that diet. And while I was doing this book, I interviewed, I was able to, a great thing about lockdown, by the way, is that VVIPs are stuck at home. I end up having to talk to people like me about the Queen. So I managed to get hold of George W. Bush, former President of U.S., a man who, probably the President who knows her best, because he knew her when his father was President, and when he himself was President. And he made the point. He couldn't get his head around the fact that the Queen has met and known 14 presidents. He said there is absolutely no one ever anywhere in the whole world, including America. who has met and known 14 presidents. It's almost a third of the entire total. And that's soft power. It's why Obama, President Obama, just weeks after that extraordinary visit to Ireland, the Obama came to stay at the palace. I was lucky enough to cover that as well. That was extraordinary. And Obama had no truck with the Cameron government. I mean, you know, the White House and Dining Street were not particularly getting on, but the Obama's came to the palace and it was absolutely hit it off. Obama loved it. So much so that when I interviewed George Osborne, He reminded me that evening when the Queen came up to him at the end of the state banquet, they're having drinks afterwards. And the Queen said to Osborne, Mr. Chancellor, could you tell the President it's time to go to bed? Because it was well past her bedtime. And Osborne thought, Christ, what do I do? Got the private secretary to gently nudge the Obama's off to bed. And I spoke to Obama's right-hand man, Ben Rhodes, who was with him in the room, after-party back in the Obama's suite. And Obama was just humming, buzzing. He absolutely loved it. Just sitting there, you couldn't even concentrate on the speech. was supposed to be doing the next day because he just wanted to talk about the queen. And it wasn't starstruck. Wasn't celebrity. It was the fact that she could talk so ably about all her pre, all his predecessors to him, the fact that she'd made him very welcome, what she represented to so many generations. He was completely struck by it. And right in the middle of this sort of peroration by Obama, suddenly there's a sort of knock on the door. And it's a footman going, I'm frightfully sorry, Mr. President, but there's a mouse. At which point he's, don't tell the first lady she hates. mice and Michelle Obama's getting changed in the next door room. So it was a completely surreal moment. The other surreal point about all this, this is coming from his right-hand man to me, was that the palace is the only place the Obama's ever stayed where they didn't have an en-sweet bathroom. The Belgian suite at the palace, to go to the bathroom, you have to go down the corridor. So here you've got the most powerful man in the world. He's been kicked off to bed early and he's staying in a room with vermin. You know, if you want to go to the loo, he's got to walk down a corridor. You'd think this was not really great. diplomacy. And yet for Obama, Obama absolutely loved it. They had a great relationship with the Queen right the way through his presidency, who was the first world leader to fly in on the day after her 90th birthday, to wish her a happy birthday, Obama. And right at the end of his presidency, made an extraordinary speech, actually, where he discussed the entire essence of leadership in the world today. And he picked out two great leaders of his lifetime. And one was Nelson Mandela, and the other was the Queen. So going back to this point, is it celebrity, No, it goes far beyond that, far beyond. And the same with Prince Charles as well. I was at the COP 26 last year. To be, I spent a day with Prince Charles, I sort of following him around in the background, watching all these world leaders queuing up to talk to him, to meet him, to thank him. I was in the room and Joe Biden came up and hugged him and said, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you and what you've fought for. And Prince William, we've talked about that trip to the Caribbean, that some people have said it's disastrous. I mean, that's the standard sort of Twitter narrative. It was a disaster. I spoke to people who were there. it was not a disaster. The Bob Marley Museum in Kingston were thrilled after a pandemic to have some celebrities. And don't forget, they were not there because they were propping up some crumbling throne or they were on holiday. They were there at the invitation of the government that invited the Queen on independence to be head of state. It's not a case of the monarchy clinging on. And for precisely those reasons we've heard tonight, why did all these countries, whether Jamaica or some Vincent and the Grenadines that voted to keep her in a referendum very recently, Why do all these countries choose to have the monarchy? It's not because they like having the queen and they think she's lovely. It's because it's that power that stops the overmighty politician getting their hands on the forces, the judiciary, the honours system, the civil service. That's what monarchy about. That's what soft power is. At the end of his reign, King Farouk of Egypt famously said one day, there'll only be, or very soon, there'll only be five kings left. King of clubs, diamonds, spades and hearts and the King of England. and he wasn't quite right. There's 27 monarchs still left. They exist for a reason. Monarchy does work. Look at the UN Development Index. You'll find that in the top 10 and the top 20, even though the vast majority of countries in the world are republics, half of the top 10 and half of the top 20 are monarchy. It's because of stability, permanence and continuity. And it's got nothing to do with celebrity. I beg you to oppose. Thank you. Thank you.
