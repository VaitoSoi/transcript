 Thank you. It was a very formative period in my development the years I spent in Oxford, 1969 to 73, a long time ago for you, but Oxford doesn't change that much. So I just, before we get on to discussion, I thought I would just tell you a little bit about what I've been working on, what my main interests are, what I hope we'll be talking about, but I don't want to constrain you from asking questions. about anything else relating to my work. If you want to know what I'm currently doing, I'm working on a revision of animal liberation. I hope some of you will know that book. First published in 1975, and actually the idea for it started when I was here, although I didn't really write the bulk of it here. I think I wrote one chapter and an outline, a kind of proposal for a publisher while I was in Oxford and then I had a one-year position in New York University and a bit of time off to write it. So it has been continuously in print since then, which is great, but it has got somewhat out of date. I did do a full revision of it in 1990, but since then, although the publishers will say that this is a new edition, essentially it's got a new preface or some of the facts corrected a little bit, but it hasn't really been worked through. So if any of you have picked it up, you would notice that even in the most recent edition, most of the material predates 1990, which is the last time it was thoroughly revised. So if you look at the chapter on experiments, you'll only find experiments done before 1990. And, you know, people may think, ah, well, those were the bad old days. I'm sure things have improved a lot since then. And I won't deny that things have improved a little bit since then, but I think there's still a lot wrong with the treatment of animals in research. I think there's even more wrong with the treatment of animals in factory farms, which has actually greatly expanded. And although there have been, again, some useful reforms, particularly in the European Union, and I guess although you're no longer part of that, I think you haven't actually ditched those laws or regulations entirely. So, yes, there's been some improvements, but there's been a lot of things that have continued as bad as they were. So I'm now working on a full revision, which I hope we'll be out sometime next year. And that's obviously part of my continuing interest in the ethics of how we ought to treat animals and I try to keep up to date with developments in that and it's interesting to see such a lot more work being done in this field and when I started there was virtually nothing very little it was being written by philosophers or to a general public and of course it'll be obvious to you that there's been a huge upsurge in the availability of vegan food for a variety of reasons, animal concerns, climate concerns, health and so on. So that's a development that I greatly welcome. So that's continued to be one of my major interests since the early 1970s. Also around that time I wrote an article called famine affluence and morality that some of you may have read in which I argued that people living in affluent countries, even if they're not the themselves particularly affluent, but if they're just middle class or above, they're affluent by global standards, and that those of us, we, I'm certainly one of them, do have an obligation to help people in extreme poverty elsewhere in the world. That it's not just a nice thing to do, but not a bad thing if you don't do it. I think it is part of thinking of yourself as living an ethical life in a world that's as sharply unequal as the world is today to do your part to improve the lives of those who through no fault of their own are in fairly dire poverty and of course from time to time where there are famines or other other things that affect them you know we'll be dying in large numbers from preventable causes and in fact that's something that goes on even as we're talking here even if there's no particular crisis simply through diseases that we could prevent like diarrhea which is still a major killer malaria and a variety of other problems. So questions about global poverty what we ought to be doing about it, how demanding that ethic should be is another of the areas that I've been working on and I'll certainly be happy to talk to you about those things. And thirdly, I've been working in bioethics, which is the ethical issues relating to developments in medicine and the biological sciences. I set up a centre, the first university-based centre in Australia for doing that at Monash University in 1981, and I've continued to work on that, and the chair that I hold at Princeton is a chair of bioethics, although that's fairly broadly interpreted, so it doesn't restrict me from doing work on the other things that I've mentioned. But particularly worked on questions about life and death, critiques of the view that there's a special inviolability about human life which means that things like voluntary euthanasia or medically assisted dying are wrong. And again I've been really pleased to see that there has been a movement in that direction. I think the United Kingdom is rather behind a lot of other countries in this respect and it's interesting that even countries with a Catholic background like Spain and probably very soon Portugal are allowing medically assisted dying whereas the United Kingdom is not I was also pleased that my native country Australia where this is legislated on a state basis the last state to come on board with this New South Wales just about a week ago legislation so it will be almost everywhere in in Australia within a year or two so I'm happy to discuss those issues or any other issues relating to bioethics that you might want to talk about or that you might want to ask me about it of course no amazing thank you so much again Peter it's really a pleasure to have you here I guess you've given us a brief overview of work right now but if we backtrack all the way back to your childhood you obviously grew up in Melbourne, what do you kind of recall from your childhood? Are there any elements from your family or things like that that might have piqued your interest in philosophy or moments that you recall that shaped your thinking in later life? It's hard to see. I mean I think I don't think anyone could have predicted when I was 14 or something that I would end up going into philosophy. They might have said that I enjoyed a good argument. I had I had school teachers who said that, you know, who thought at that time maybe that I was arguing too much with things that they said. But, you know, how do you earn a living from having an enjoyment in arguing or maybe even some talent for arguing? Well, the most obvious, excuse me, the most obvious answer to that is as a lawyer. And I have an older sister, I had, sorry, she's sadly no longer with us, who was studying law. And I talked to her about law, and that was what I was thinking of doing when I finished high school and went to university. But my sister had a boyfriend who subsequently became her husband, who had done some philosophy, and so I did talk to him a bit. And I decided to do a combined degree in arts and law. And in the arts, I thought, okay, I'll take a philosophy. subject and see what it's like. So, you know, if I hadn't done that, you know, you can see circumstances could have been quite different. My sister could have done something quite different. She might not have had a boyfriend who talked in an interesting way about philosophy. I think there's lots of twists and turns in my biography of those years that could have led me somewhere quite different. Yeah, definitely. And in your early formative years, much like all of us, you spent part of your time in Oxford right here in Baylio College. And there's a particular moment while you were at Oxford where you had an encounter with a fellow student and that's what turned you into a vegetarian. Do you want to walk us through kind of what happened and what was going through your head? I'm happy to walk you through. A minor correction, although this event that I'm about to talk about took place in Bayel. I was actually a student at Univ, not at Baylor. But anyway. So I came to Oxford as a graduate student. I'd finished, just to go on with the story before, although I started out doing a combined arts law degree, I got more interested in the philosophy, I got offered a scholarship to do a master's degree in philosophy, and I never finished the law degree, so I'm not a lawyer. But then I also got a scholarship to come to Oxford for a further work after the masters. And so I was a graduate student, I was attending classes, and there was a graduate student, I was attending classes, And there was a class in new college taught by Jonathan Glover, who was then teaching here about freedom, freedom and determinism and its implications for moral responsibility. And it was a good class, and there wasn't a very large class, there was plenty of discussion. So there were a few of us involved in a discussion in one particular class. And after that, one of the students, a Canadian called Richard Keshen came up to me, and said he was interested in something that I'd said in the discussion and was I satisfied with Jonathan Glover's answer and I wasn't completely satisfied and we started a discussion and the class finished around lunchtime so he said would you like to come to my college by the old to continue our discussion So I said fine and we went over and I think things are rather different in Oxford colleges now, but at that time you were offered two options when you came in for lunch. There was a hot dish and there was a salad plate. The hot dish on that particular day was spaghetti which had some sort of brand sauce that you couldn't quite say what was in it on top of it. Maybe that hasn't changed so much. I don't know. So Richard said, can you tell me is there meat in that sauce? And he was told that there was and he took the salad plate. So I didn't have any problems with meat so I the spaghetti and the salad plate was you know a bit of a light lunch really I think not a great salad a few leaves of lettuce and a slice of tomato and so on so we continued the conversation for a while about freedom and its implications for moral responsibility or determinism and its implications for moral responsibility but after a while after that stopped I asked him what why he'd asked that question about meat and you have to you know it's probably pretty hard for most of you to imagine but here I was I was 24 years old I had never had a serious conversation with anyone about not eating meat I'm not even sure that I'd actually met anyone who didn't eat meat but quite possibly I'd met some Indians who didn't eat meat for reasons that Hinduism gives to some Indians but nobody with whom I felt I could really relate to my way of thinking about ethics and the world. So what Richard said was simply I don't think it's right to treat the animals turned into meat the way that they're treated. And that obviously was something that I could relate to because you know I wasn't in favor of cruelty to animals. I wouldn't have supported any anything that was obviously cruel but I really didn't know how animals were treated at the time. I assumed that they were out on the fields, leading pretty good lives, getting enough to eat, protected from predators, and extremes of weather. And then of course they were killed. I knew that they were killed. I knew that being trucked to slaughterhouse couldn't have been a pleasant experience because every now and again driving around country roads you would follow a truck crammed with cattle or pigs or chickens. But I hadn't really thought much more about that or about the moral status. of animals. But just at lunch really led me to do it. Richard said he would introduce me to some other people he knew who were vegetarians. He suggested I read what was the only book on factory farming at that time, a book by Ruth Harrison called Animal Machines. And of course there was no internet or videos to look out on YouTube. So it was hard to find out anything more. But Ruth Harrison's book was very powerful and very convincing because it quoted. from the farming journals which were telling farmers how to treat animals in order to essentially maximize the profitability of their farms and it was pretty obvious that this was not taking into account the well-being of animals beyond the point that well if they all die you're not going to make money out of your farm so that's really got what got me thinking about animals and certainly that again a chance encounter changed my life yeah definitely and from Then on out, your book Animal Liberation has truly had an enormous impact and I'd say led to kind of a worldwide movement for animal rights. Do you think sufficient progress has been made on this issue and what kind of further progress would you like to see? I certainly don't think sufficient progress has been made. As I said, there has been some progress. So some of the things that I talk about in animal liberation and we'll continue to talk about because they still exist in much of the world, don't exist in the European Union, and as I said, don't exist in the United Kingdom either because the United Kingdom accepted the European Union's regulations on that and hasn't, fortunately, backed down from them. These are things like the standard battery cage for laying hens, which crowded hens in small wire cages, too small for them to stretch their wings, and prevented them performing many other kinds of natural behavior, such as laying their eggs in a sort of private place, which even hens that have never had the opportunity to do that will do if you give them the opportunity because it's a natural instinct for them. So cages have not been entirely banned, but they are larger than they were originally. They do have to have nesting boxes, And so they're somewhat better. Similarly, individual stalls for veal calves and for breeding sows, the mothers of the pigs who were sent to market, used to be just individual narrow stalls that prevented the animals even walking more than a step forward or backward, prevented them, they were so narrow they prevented the animals turning round. Those were also not allowed in the European Union or here. And there's been some progress in the United States, California legislated against these things. Actually, well, didn't really legislate that had a voter initiative referendum. And most of the places in the United States where there's been progress, I think there's nine states that have got somewhat similar regulations to the EU now. And of those nine, eight of them, states with possibility of citizens initiating a referendum on a particular issue. So there's only one where it's gone through the state legislature with that an initiative and a referendum. And I think what that shows is that if you can get the issue in front of Americans and tell them how their animals are kept, they'll vote against it. But because money plays such a big role in American politics, I'm not saying politics is perfect here, but I think American politics is more corrupt than the parliamentary democracies like the United Kingdom or Australia or most of Europe, that I'm more familiar with, more corrupt in the sense that money plays a bigger role. And I think that's why it's been impossible to get these changes across the United States as a whole. And there are many other countries, including Australia, that don't do too well by these standards either. So that's one big difference. I already mentioned experiments on animals. There have been some improvements. But again, unfortunately, I was somewhat shocked, I should say, when I started doing the research, for the new edition. I had thought from what I'd read that there would be fewer really nasty experiments that I could find, and not only really nasty but in some cases pretty pointless experiments, not curing cancer or anything like that, whereas in fact there's a lot of experiments that cause severe pain and distress that I don't think really doing any good for humans either. So I think there's still a very long way to go. Yeah, definitely. Of course, with the growth of veganism and concern with animal welfare, both of these can really be traced back to your philosophy, specifically your preference utilitarianism. Do you think that you being known as sort of the most influential living philosopher is an overstatement of your influence on these issues? And are there other thinkers on these issues that may have influenced your thoughts at the onset, which don't get a lot of our own. recognition. So as for the tag about being the world's most influential living philosopher, I think that's unfortunately a reflection on the relatively little influence that philosophers have on the wider community. And that's, I think, regrettable. I think there are more philosophers now going into applied ethics, practical ethics. There have been over the last decade or two, and that's good. But the other thing that you have to do, if you want to be a philosopher with some influence, is right for a broader audience. And that's again something that a lot of my colleagues don't want to do. And you can understand, you know, if you're going for jobs in philosophy, which is a very competitive market, or if you have got a job but it doesn't have tenure, you don't have any likelihood of being able to stay in the job you're in, then you can understand that people want to write for their colleagues more than they want to write for the people who will have no influence on whether they get jobs or not. But it's a pity and I think it's possible to do both to do good academic work and to do work that is accessible to a broad audience. So I certainly encourage any of you who are going to be doing philosophy or writing or for that, it's not just philosophy, other fields of academia as well obviously, to have a try to write in a clear and straightforward way, too shallow, but something that doesn't use jargon, doesn't presuppose things that only you and others in your discipline know, and to try to reach that wider audience. Yeah, I mean, speaking of academia, some people look at academics as activists on particular issues, and I think you would not be an exception. Do you personally consider yourself an activist? And out of all of the causes that you've sort of written and spoken about, which one would you say is the closest to your heart? Yeah, so I've certainly been an activist for many years on the animal issue and I was involved When I went back to Australia, I was involved in Organizations. I actually spent about I don't know maybe 10 or 15 years as president of an organization called Animal Liberation in Victoria and I also co-founded an organization that's now called Animals Australia So I've been involved in, yes, I have been involved in the kind of activism of various sorts, you know, marches, protests, demonstrations, but also lobbying members of parliament and trying to achieve change that way. And to some extent that cause might be the one that, you know, is still closest to my heart, although I am very concerned about the global poverty issue. and I also co-founded an organization for that called The Life You Can Save. You can go online to the Life You Can Save.org. It tries to do two things. One is it tries to spread the idea that I already mentioned that we have the capacity to do an immense amount of good for people in extreme poverty and that we're not really living ethically unless we do that. But also to say if you are going to do that, which are the most effective organizations to donate to? So we have a list of a little over 20 organisations that have been independently vetted to show that they are really giving you good value for money. And a lot of people, when they think about donating to charity, don't do any research to find out which charities will actually do the most good with their donation. And I on the broader effective altruism movement, which of course has strong roots in Oxford through the work of people like Toby Ord and Will McCaskill and the Centre for Effective Altruism here, the Centre for Global Priorities. So that's an important point that they're all making, that we need to try and think about how we can do the most good with whatever resources we have that we have available to do good. And that might be money, although for students probably you don't have a lot of that. You can talk to your parents, though. But for students, it's really important to think about your career. And if you're not already familiar with it, I'd recommend a website called 80,000 hours, which has a lot of information about careers where you can be influential and have an impact. Yeah, I mean, you said that global inequality and the responsibility of us in rich countries and reducing this inequality, inequality, is another area which you've been influential with your, I say, famine, affluence, and morality becoming a staple. for any politics and philosophy student today. I'm sure many of us in the room have read it. However, like you said, we're just students. So on an individual basis, do you have any practical recommendations for any of the members here or indeed people watching online for something we can feasibly take up and do about the issue? Well, I do think there's certainly scope for political action here to make your government more aware that this is an important issue for you. I think governments do respond. to that in a lot of places they've been going backwards on foreign aid. The United Kingdom took a very positive step a few years ago when there was bipartisan agreement to raise foreign aid to 0.7% of GDP, which was something that the United Nations has suggested as a standard many years ago, and that only a handful of countries, I think the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands, very few countries were actually reaching and Britain said that they would reach it and they did reach it but that was abandoned recently it went down to I think 0.5 percent so you know that's unfortunate I think Britain can afford more but you know the countries that I spend most time in the United States and Australia are not even giving that so you know you're not the worst but but it's it would be good to talk about those issues to try to raise that and to do things politically and the other thing that I think is really important is to do something about climate change and there I think political action is is really necessary and now for once I can speak proudly of Australia because if you followed the Australian election results we had some really surprising results the the Greens who had only one seat in the lower house now have at least three with the possibility of winning a fourth and even more surprisingly a group of independence campaigning basically on climate change on two things climate change and an independent authority to look at corruption in politics that group we they called themselves the teal independence because they had that teal bluish color has now going to have nine members in the lower house which is startling I think three of them had been independents before But six of them are new members. I think the six are all women, which is also a healthy addition to our parliament. And of course we've got a Labor government now, which was certainly better than the coalition we had before on climate change. And I think with the Greens and the independents pushing it is really going to do something quite strong. So politics does make a difference after all, for those of you who are cynical about it. So think about that and think how you can contribute that way. Yeah, I mean speaking to someone slightly away from politics, Elon Musk, one idea he does have is that humanity needs to become an interplanetary species in order to avoid extinction given our worrying, fragile place in the cosmos. Do you think this is something we should actually focus on achieving, or do you think it's wishful thinking that we should leave for future generations and instead focus on our planet to ensure that there are future generations. Yeah, I'm inclined to think that we should be focusing on our planet as you put it. I can see the point behind it. You know, you want to prevent human extinction and if you had a self-sufficient colony on Mars, then if there were, let's say, a nuclear war or a deadly pandemic that was so contagious that it killed everybody, yes, then you could say, well, people would still be alive on Mars and eventually they could repopulate Earth. But I think the problems on Earth are more urgent and there's a lot of good you can do and I wouldn't really focus on the large summers that are required to see whether it's even possible to have a self-sufficient colony on Mars at this stage. I would leave that for the future. I would certainly focus on reducing risks of extinction on this planet, but also on doing good in other ways. Yeah, and of course, some of the problems that you tend to focus on tend to be one of the biggest ones in the world. So climate change, poverty, things like that, all of which are sort of take place on a global scale. And the ineffective nature of our intergovernmental global order in terms of peacekeeping, reducing inequality, and maintaining global health has been highlighted over the past couple of years. Are there any reforms that you see being drastically necessary on either the state or global level, for instance, at the level of the UN, to prevent the fracturing of our world? Well, there are certainly changes that you could see as necessary, but the problem is how they're going to be achieved. So take something that seems very obvious and would have really benefited everybody. We've had this. coronavirus pandemic and I expect everybody here has been at least doubly vaccinated, maybe triply vaccinated as I have. And that's a good thing, but there are large parts of the world where people, most people have not been vaccinated because the supplies of vaccine have not been there. The World Health Organization has been calling for more to be done here and they have a Kovacs scheme for doing that, but they haven't got enough, despite various affluentations donating significant numbers of doses, it's still not nearly enough. And that's not only beneficial for the people in those countries, it's also a really obvious thing for us to do to prevent new variants of the virus evolving, which of course they're doing all the time. And it's only if we get vaccinated globally that we'll have some some protection against that. Maybe we still won't have complete protection, but it would certainly help. So the fact that we can't even do something like that, which is relatively simple, makes me wonder how, say that if you mentioned the United Nations, what could the United Nations do more to prevent inequality in general, economic inequality, or the World Trade Organization, for instance, which deals with those issues, but has never shown any real ability to deal with trade, that makes things more equal. And when it comes to conflicts like the war in Ukraine that we have now, the Security Council arrangement, of course, which has the victorious powers from World War II exercising veto rights over decisions there, means that you can't do anything if one of those powers is involved and is willing to veto resolutions, as is the case with Russia now. Yeah, I mean, it's really tricky to, I guess, organize around some of these larger issues and oftentimes find a solution for what works and what doesn't. So with going back to climate change like we were discussing, of course it's undoubtedly the greatest threat to our existence at the moment and we do need as many people as possible to change their way of life urgently. Here in the UK, groups like Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain have taken to direct action to try to persuade people to take the necessary steps to change their way of living. However, their actions seem to have at least for now the opposite effects, with many of these direct action groups being ridiculed by the general public and, you know, mainstream media. Do you think that direct action is the right approach for climate change and other big issues, or do you think there is a different, perhaps less blunt strategy to get people to change really their lifestyle? That's an interesting question because I have supported civil disobedience on a range of issues. In fact, the thesis that I wrote in when I was here in Oxford got published as a very, a book called Democracy and Disobedience. And it was about civil disobedience really in relation to the war in Vietnam that mainly made me interested in that. But it discusses the justifications for civil disobedience in democracies. And I supported that and I continued to support it for the animal movement. And generally I support civil disobedience for climate change as well. But as you say, there is something. of a backlash sometimes to the extinction rebellion and particularly with the fact that rather remarkably this independent group and the Greens succeeded in Australia, you know, maybe that is a better path. There is one thing that I ought to say about the Australian election results though that's not immediately translatable to the United Kingdom and that is that we have, for the lower house, we have what we call preferential voting, which in the United States it's called ranked choice voting. And this result was really only made possible because of that. Because if you had greens who did not, were not getting the most votes, they could still get elected by, if they could get the second most votes, for example, and Labor was third, then Labor generally was preferencing the Greens. so the combination of Labor's preferences and the Greens would get the Greens in. And that happened with these independents as well. So I think First Past the Post is a really bad electoral system, I have to say. I don't know whether it's going to be possible to change that either in the United States or here. But I certainly think it would make it easier for elections to really reflect shifts in public opinion of the sort that we just had in Australia. Yeah, I mean on that note, how might we strengthen democracy in countries like the UK and US, where it seems like those in power or those that were in power are kind of eroding our democratic norms? It's really difficult. I guess you know, you have to get people sufficiently fed up with the politicians in power, as obviously they were in Australia, to vote for other groups. But as I just said, the first pass the post system makes that hard. And unfortunately it doesn't seem like either of the major parties here are willing to support a change in that. If one of them were, then with the Lib Dems, of course, and other supports, you maybe would get a change. But it's difficult to do that. In the United States, it's even worse because one of the, as I said earlier, one of the problems in the United States is the huge sums of money that go into elections and go to individual candidates for elections as well and support candidates in the primary system that they have that the Republican Democrat parties used to nominate their candidates. And that was the result, or at least made worse, by a Supreme Court decision. And the United States has a very conservative Supreme Court now, which you've no doubt read about the leaked draft of the decision on the abortion case. It seems almost certain that it's going to overrule Roe v. Wade. So it's also not likely to backtrack from a case called Citizens United, which essentially opened up the possibilities of donating more or less unlimited sums of money to political candidates. So yeah, I wish I knew the answer to how you're going to change that, but unfortunately I don't. I mean, I guess it's worse even elsewhere around the world. So what do you make of increasingly assertive autocratic regimes around the world using their soft influence to hinder free expression in democratic countries and kind of how do you think we might fight back and prevent for instance foreign censors dictating what ends up in the final cut of movies and things like that yeah um again it's it's it's really hard to know what to do i think we're seeing you know the worst consequences of that in in russia and the war in ukraine now in that, you know, like Putin started out, it seemed, almost as a kind of a Democrat, you know, was elected. He's gradually got more and more authoritarian. And now, of course, it's very dangerous to voice any opposition to the war in Ukraine. We just had a Russian diplomat speak out very bluntly about what a crime against the Ukrainian people this is. but he was in Geneva and he's obviously not going to be going back to Russia anytime soon. So you know for the Russians there themselves whatever they think about this they have to be incredibly brave to really speak out against it. So you know I don't know it's possible that the results of this war and the economic sanctions will be so disastrous for Russians that they will somehow get rid of Putin I certainly hope so that would be the best outcome. But you know how you achieve that how you support help that I don't really know And, you know, if you're referring to regimes like Victor Orban's regime in Hungary, which is certainly a sort of move towards autocracy strongly, and to some extent the government in Poland has been doing that gradually too. With these countries, I suppose, because they're members of the European Union, there's greater possibilities of putting pressure on them, although the UK can't participate in that anymore now. But I hope that the other countries that are members of the EU, will do that. But then, you know, if you talk about China, for example, I really don't know how you change that at all. Yeah. I mean, there are some things that we've made strides towards changing in the past the years for sure. So, for instance, against racism, sexual, sexism and sexual harassment, we've had movements like BLM and the Me Too movement, which has really sparked a conversation and change the way that we look at certain big issues around the world. Do you think we need something like this regarding animal ethics or welfare in order for us as a species to reach a point where we're properly concerned about these issues? I certainly think in regard to animals we could and it would be good if we could have movements that had that kind of influence. You know, sometimes people ask, what is it that you think our grandchildren will look back? on and wonder how we could have been so blind to what we were doing, right? And you can certainly see that about racism, you know, I mean, you're the grandchildren now, and looking back on asking perhaps, you know, depends a bit where you are, obviously, but but certainly if you're living in a lot of the United States, you could say, you know, how could my grandparents go along with such a discriminatory, racist system? And you can also say, how is it that, and this might even just be your, you know, how could your parents rather than your grandparents, how could they cover up such sexual harassment when it was so obvious in the workplace and the office but they just turned a blind, or the men at least anyway, turned a blind eye to it. So if you ask that question about what is it that most people now accept and don't criticize that maybe your children will think how could you do that? I think the treatment of animals and particularly factory farming, you know, How could people just continue to eat products that really they knew or at least ought to have known, would have known if they hadn't deliberately turned away from it? Were the products of lifelong cruelty and misery being inflicted on animals to produce something that none of us really need to eat? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, as a vegan, I couldn't agree more wholeheartedly. So with that, I'd like to open the floor to some audience questions. If you've got a question, please feel for to raise your hand or hold up your membership card, and then I'll just point to you. Cool. I'd like to recognize the member with the Adidas shirts. Thank you much. Just wait for the, wait for the mic. I wanted to ask you a question more about your philosophy and the axioms that underlie your moral thinking. So you repeatedly like referred to like the most good and it seems that the reason why you do this is utilitarian, the framework that underlies your thinking. And I was wondering, when did you adopt this framework, and what was the most convincing argument that made you adopt this framework? Okay, thanks for the question. So first, you know, it's true, of course, that I am a utilitarian, and that does explain why I talk about the most good you can do and why I'm concerned about suffering whichever beings experience it. But not everybody in the effective altruism movement is utilitarian, and not everybody in the animal movement is utilitarian. You know, certainly there can be non-utilitarian people who are concerned about extreme poverty. After all, if you have a Christian background, you know, you know that Jesus talked a lot about people in poverty and helping them. And, you know, there are Christian utilitarians, but there are a lot of non-utilitarian Christians as well. And in respective animals, it's interesting that we've now seen. about more philosophical work being done about animals. We've now seen probably the best known Kantian writing in English about Kantian ethics, Christine Korsgaard, with a book called Fellow Creatures, saying that actually Kant was wrong on denying that animals are ends in themselves. We've had contractualists on this issue. We've had people from a lot of different positions. So you don't have to be a utilitarian to agree with me about animals or global poverty or a number of other issues. But I have been a utilitarian for a long time. You say what was the most convincing argument? In a way, I became a utilitarian because I thought the arguments against it were not convincing. In my first course on ethics, well not the introductory first year course, which had some ethics, but the first course in Thailand on ethics, I was taught by a lecturer who was quite hostile to utilitarianism. He was a follower of W.D. Ross, who was a professor of moral philosophy here in the 20s, who was an intuitionist. He had various intuitions about what our duties are. And he was an opponent of utilitarianism, and so was the professor or lecturer who taught me. And he had various objections to it. I remember one was this objection that You were in a southern town where lynching was still the prevailing way in which the white people dealt with the black people in that town. A white woman had been raped and said she was raped by a black man. So the white mob had gathered. They'd got six black people from the town at random. There they were they'd put nooses around their neck. They were about to hang them from a nearby tree. nearby tree you're the sheriff but you're powerless to actually stop them you know you're one person they have guns too of course you can't really physically prevent them from lynching these innocent people the only thing you could do is you could say I've got evidence that that one and let's say you point randomly at one of the six is the one who did it let the others go and assume that if you do that then Five of them will go, one of them will die. Now, the argument of my lecturer was that that would be the wrong thing to do. That as a sheriff, your duty is to uphold the law, you can't lie about something significant like that and that would be wrong. But if you really believe in the example, this unfortunate person who you're going to point to, was going to die in a moment anyway. Whereas there's five people who are not going to die if you tell the lie and violate your oath of office or whatever it might be. So if you really assume that there's no further consequences, you know, nobody is ever going to know that you lied about this, no other bad consequences, I thought, well, it would be right to break that oath. And so I convinced myself that at least that objection wasn't a good one. And I went through other objections during the course and in subsequent classes and I found in the end that I thought that all of the objections played to intuitions which were normally sound rules, right? Lies, you know, don't tell lies or don't tell lies in serious situations like this is generally a good rule. Don't frame an innocent person, of course, is a good rule. You know, if you've taken an oath and you're in a position where you have a certain role, follow that role to the best of your ability, they're normally good rules. But they have exceptions in unusual circumstances. And I thought a lot of the objections to utilitarianism were like that. And in the end, we're not really conclusive objections. So essentially that's what persuaded me. Plus, I suppose you could say that utilitarianism is about things that we know matter to us and matter to others, whether it's a classical form where you talk about pleasure and pain, and we all try to avoid pain and gain some pleasure, or whether it's about satisfying preferences, which we also do. that these are things that are pretty concrete that we know about, that we value, that we know others value. So generalizing that impartially to all beings who can experience pleasure or pain or have preferences seemed like a reasonable thing to do. Whereas you know the idea that there are these prima facie duties that Ross talked about or that you know some of the other ethical positions were just a little bit more mysterious. You need to say well where do these come from how do we know that these are the right duties and I guess you know I have a sort of sense of wanting to be down to earth and not too mysterious and that combined as I say with ways of answering the obvious objections convinced me that utilitarianism utilitarianism was more defensible than the other views that I was familiar with yeah thank you so much and thank you so much for your question we have time for a couple more audience questions. I recognise the women in the point-ultimate row, yeah. Thank you so much for such an interesting talk and I thought what you were saying about how future generations might see our treatment of animals today was particularly interesting. But I was wondering whether you think there's a risk that animal activists by campaigning right now for efforts to improve welfare for farm animals might undermine the animal liberal. caused in the long run by allowing people to justify eating animal products, for example, on the grounds that welfare standards are improving. So just before you give up the mic, let me check that I've understood your question. Are you suggesting that trying to get people to give up animal products altogether or factory farm products is not the best way to achieve these ends? No, I was wondering whether right now of animal activists are pushing for movements to say increase the amount space available to farmed animals for example. Oh, I see. So rather than trying to abolish it, they're trying to make welfare improvements. That's the question. Good. OK. So I don't think that that is actually the case, right? If I really, to some extent, it's a factual question, isn't it? Are we by trying to get, you know, I talked about those EU regulations which apply here, getting more space for hens, allowing pigs and calves to turn around. Are we actually reducing the chance of abolishing factory farming altogether or of getting society to be completely vegan altogether? And the idea is that, you know, well, if things are not so bad, people will feel okay about buying these products. If things were really terrible, we would have a stronger case for saying you shouldn't buy it. If that were the case, I would be troubled by advocating improvements in welfare. But I just don't see any evidence that it is the case. And in fact, if you look at the countries that have these better welfare conditions for farm animals that have some reforms, or if you like, the parts of the United States that have them, they tend to be the parts that also have the largest number of vegans, you know, where vegan food is most plentifully available. So that's certainly more true. within the EU now than it is in other countries that don't have those reforms. And if you look at within the United States, so the biggest state that has passed these kind of reforms is California. And California is certainly the state, you know, well perhaps along with some states on the Eastern Seaboard, New York maybe, the state where you would have, find the highest proportion of vegans, the highest, greatest availability of vegan food in supermarkets. So it seems to me that they, that they go together in a way, that it's a kind of progression. You have campaigns about animal welfare, which enlighten people about conditions in factory farms and make them think about animals. And then at least a significant number of them move towards deciding, oh, well, yeah, we've achieved some reforms, but it's still not all that good, and I don't really need to eat these products at all. Thanks so much, and again, you've caught me. I'm not only a vegan, but I'm from California as well. Go figure. We have time for one more audience question. I recognize a member in the far back in the green shirts. Thank you so much for coming and giving that Q&A for us today. Yeah, I was wondering about kind of recent trends in the effect of altruism movement towards long-term So philosophers like Wilma Caskell or Hillary Greaves or Toby Ord and towards looking more closely at humanity's long-term future, maybe to the exclusion of causes like alleviating global poverty or reducing animal suffering right now. So I was wondering what your thoughts more generally on long-termism were, whether you thought that was a good trend for the movement. Yeah, thank you. And for those who are not familiar with the thing as you talked about, I'd recommend Toby Ord's book The Precipice, and Will McCaskill has a book coming out about long-termism in the future as well. So I'm glad that Will and Toby and Hillary and others are thinking about long-term consequences of actions, about how to reduce the risk of extinction. We talked about Elon Musk in that connection, of course. thinking about the long-term consequences of our actions and how we can produce a better world over not just decades, not just centuries, but millennia or even more. But I do think that it would be wrong to focus exclusively on these issues. Again, as I said in response to your question about Musk, we do have very serious problems Some of those problems may be, solving those problems, may be important for our survival anyway. Climate change could be a risk to survival in itself, and even if it's not just from warming the planet, it could be that we have more wars because people need to move and perhaps those wars might lead to nuclear conflicts, which could cause our extinction. And global poverty after all, when there are hundreds of millions or billions of people in the world who don't get a decent education, you know, we're losing an incredible amount of talent that could be helping to solve the world's problems because of poverty. So getting the world out of poverty is really going to help produce more people who will have the ability to solve these problems. And I think that's clearly a good thing. So I think it would be a pity if we focused exclusively on long-termism. And although it's important, I think we need a broad EA movement. I'd like more people to start thinking about effective altruism. And, you know, it's hard enough to get people, say, here in the United Kingdom, to think about the well-being of people in sub-Saharan Africa. It's not all that far away in a global world, but it gets a lot less attention in the news than developments in Europe or nearby. And if that's hard, then how hard is it to get people to think about what we can do for people who will be living in 100 years, 500 years, 1,000 years, 10,000 years, a million years? It's really difficult. So you're not going to get a broad EA movement if you focus on long-termism and if people get the idea that the EA movement is all about long-termism. I think you've got to include things like global poverty, animal suffering, which bring in a lot of more people. And some of them will think about long-termism then and gravitate towards that side of the movement and others will do good things for people in poverty and animals and maybe other issues that we haven't even thought about that much. Thank you so much. And thank you for your question. I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. But again, it was the utmost pleasure of mine to speak to you. And I'm sure our audience members were able to learn a lot. Would everyone join me in thanking Mr. Peter Singer for coming today? I'm
