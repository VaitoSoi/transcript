 Thank you, Jan, for that very fine speech. I now look to Rahm Asset to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. I'm a humorized lawyer, an advocate. I want to begin by acknowledging how intimately I understand the desperation of the unheard, the desire to be listened to, for their pain to be acknowledged, to affect change. Tonight, I want to tell your story about a man with a very fine name, Ekbarah said, whose audio changed my life forever. His crucial message shapes tonight's debate. and inform my values. My heart fills with pride to say that this man is my brother. And I hope his story and resilience ingrained themselves in your memory, embodying the power of love and kindness in the face of stark injustice. Eichbar is a tech entrepreneur, flam surpassed, a wonderful son, an amazing brother, and a shining example of truth, excellence, and grace. Because of his success as a prominent Uyghur tech entrepreneur and his commitment to Flanserope, in 2016, the U.S. State Department invited him to attend one of their most prestigious international visitors' leadership program. This program welcomed many world leaders, including this very country's four prime ministers, and the current New Zealand's prime minister, just in the Arden, just to name a few. Many of you in this room perhaps have been part of or aspired to take part in these kind of programs. Unfortunately, Akpah's fate could not be further apart from those alumni that I mentioned because he was born into a race other than a pure Chinese nation race, subservient to the Chinese leadership. He languishes in the shadow of Chinese concentration camps. While others in his cohort go on to live full and successful, life, but that doesn't mean that he lit, his life is not worthy and his story has no impact. After my relentless advocacy, pursuing justice for my brother, five years later, the Chinese government finally confirmed that he's alive, albeit he looks like a shadow of his former self. In a short video call with my parents, his message was, be kind and be kind to everybody. Despite the cruelty he was subjected, his message was kindness and not violence. His words of my parents reminded me of a powerful letter written by Dr. Martin Luther King. in support of non-violent action while imprisoned in a Birmingham city jail, a city known for its ugly record of police brutality. Such jails are very familiar to me as my brother is held in a solitary confinement in a city called Aksum, notorious for its torture. I can't imagine the corroding despair, settling in the darkness, depriving Akbar of ever hope of getting out. His sublime courage, suffering, and commitment to peace has become guiding forces in my advocacy and my values. And this is why I took the position on this side of the house. There are several reasons why the end of the truth, freedom cannot be achieved through violent means or the position of whatever is necessary. The other side tried to frame the issue in different ways, but whatever necessary means whatever is necessary. First, today from many oppressed community live under surveillance state. Advanced technology and enables and facilitates the modern autocracy and thereby provides unprecedented tools of repression. China is a perfect example of this tragedy. In a repressive technocratic state, surveillance cameras are installed everywhere to catch the violent resistor. Then it provides an opportunity for the state to label not just a him, but his entire community as extremists, and thus paving the way for further crackdown and enhancement of state violence. In the Chinese context, even genocide. Second, history informs us violence begets violence, and the participants of violent protests tend to abandon the very values of why they're fighting for this cause. Worse. Sorry, you just said violence begets violence, but also in some cases, nonviolence and peaceful protest also beget violence. And to your point, you're saying that people shouldn't do whatever is necessary, but the reality is that sometimes abstaining from doing whatever is necessary just means that your opposition will do whatever is necessary on their end. I think to your point, when you said peaceful violence, also, become violent, I think we need to understand who are the people infiltrating those protests that actually became violent protests. And this happened in Hong Kong movement, in many other protests. It's not the protests themselves who initially launched a peaceful campaign. So go back to my point, I think they will embody the various thing that they're fighting against, be it oppression, be it an ethnic cleansing. They damage. They damage. the integrity of the movement and aid in its supporters, sustaining a violent victory means one would rely on coercion and fear to maintain power. Indeed, the Chinese government, having once won its own violent revolution, justifies the torment of my brother on the logic of what is. ever is necessary to preserve security in the OIGA region. Most importantly, just means of civil disobedience lead to just results, however long it may take. Non-wilded actions achieved the goal and raise the cost for the repressive state. One of the leading scholars, as the proposition quoted, is also a non-widened protest. is also from Harvard University named Erica Chenwis. Previously, she believed that when it comes to a repressive government, power flows from a barrel of gun. Although tragic, it is sometimes necessary for people to use violence to seek change. And she did her PhD, and she changed her total position, because she realized and provided a compelling evidence telling evidence that non-violent or civil disobedience, like organizing protests, boycotts, other advocacy methods are the effective means to affect change. Another leading scholar, Omar Waseau, and Oxford's very own expert, Jean Scher, give further arguments in favor of these views. Leaders and their characters, message, and behaviors, influence people at the bottom. Successful non-violent protests are led by temperate leaders. Their followers espoused those values and thereby achieve lasting change. Rosa Parks refused to state power to unseat her from a deserving seat that led to the end of bus segregation in the United States. James Baldwin used his powerful words and poetic writings to inform the elite America about racial inequality. Together with many other civil rights activists, they peacefully guided America to a more just and fair country. As we strive to preserve better our democracy, including countries like the United States, that have witnessed attacks against the capital, we must not resort to violence. I wish the press did not need an outrage that the world were just for some everyone, but as far from the truth. I wish the privilege could understand that how deeply we yearn for a world that shared our cosmic urgency to the promised land of racial justice, as Dr. King put it. But unfortunately, we have to change this cruel reality with strategy, calmness, and high moral standards. Despite sheer cruelty, my brother perseveres. His monumental dignity and his ineradical humanity shines through, and he exemplifies kindness to the very violence that threatens him. Thus he became a rallying cry for people all around the world, including a very bright student at this fine university, who invited me to this state. The Uyghur people all around the world exemplified this courage and speaking up against the world's second most powerful country. Ladies and gentlemen, if you care about human dignity and freedom for brave, resilient, kind individuals like my brother, I hope you advocate for peaceful disobedience. Some say riots are the language of the unheard. I emphasize with that sentiment, with the rage and despair of the perceived powerlessness, to correct an injustice that deeply affects me, as well as anyone, but to win a better future for the Uyghurs and all the oppressed. Perhaps we should show that the unheard is also key, capable of kindness, for it is the language, the likeliest to win us to the ultimate victory. Thank you.
