 Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity. And I'm glad that the debate motion was changed, that a global nightmare. Because a global nightmare has befallen this world with more than 20 million people on the brink of famine in Afghanistan. 75% of Iraqi children outside schools trying to provide food. to their families, 16 million people in Yemen marching towards starvation, 12 million people in Syria facing acute food insecurity, and millions of people in Libya living in extreme poverty. All this due to the pursuit of America's global dream, a dream of imperialism, self-interest, exceptionalism, and corporate greed. Members of the House, Mr. President, I'm standing here today not as an American citizen, nor as a hater of America. Instead, I am here as a global citizen who has seen first-hand nightmares of America's global ambition. From systematic racism and inequality at home to the carpet bombing of entire civilizations, the American dream has offered the globe nothing but nightmares. I'll be making two arguments in support of this motion today. Firstly, that the very foundation of American dream and its pursuit embodies nightmare for the world. And that the American dream is nothing but a dream of war economy and corporate greed that can only bring nightmares. But before that, it falls upon me to introduce side opposition. Speaking first for side opposition would be Laura Smith, a graduate officer at the UNN, also from St. Aynes College. Now, Laura is doing her second PhD in American's presidential history. I'm not sure which American presidential dream will she break about. Because the last time I read, it was Truman who nuked the world, it was Kennedy who invaded Vietnam, it was Bush who invaded Afghanistan in Iraq. So there is no American dream left in her history. Speaking second is Scott Braun, a Republican politician and a diplomat who served as the senator from 2010 to 2013 and also appointed as US ambassador to New Zealand by Trump. Now Scott has made multiple attempts to re-election but has lost. I wonder if he is still pursuing his American dream. Speaking third is Alexander Wendman, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel and former director of European affairs. at the National Security Council. I want to warn Mr. Windman in advance to raise his defenses high, because I will make sure that American forces are in the line of fire from this side of the house. Speaking forth is Neil Catelle, an American lawyer who served as acting solicitor general of the US under Obama. Now, he's also a partner, a partner in the law firm, Hogan Lowell's. Neil describes himself as extremist centrist. I don't know what to make of that. Mr. Speaker, these are your speakers and they are most welcome. My first argument tonight that the very foundation of the American dream and its pursuit embodies nightmares for the world. The idea of American dream in the literal sense was put forth by James Adams in his book, The Epics of America. in 1930. He described this idea as a dream of land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, where the opportunity of each, according to ability or achievement. Adam even clarified this, that it is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order. While Adam's intentions were their top equality and social order, in time following World War, America was swift in commercializing the American dream. The concept of American dream turned into myths, delusions, exceptionalism, individualism, and greed. It was sold to the American people through Hollywood, American products, and to the world through American interventions, under the Christmas wrapping of freedom, democracy, justice and equality, but in reality members of the House, it embodied nothing but deaths and sufferings. At home, it came with the institution of slavery, millions of Americans without health insurance, racial blindness, massive inequality. Abroad, it achieved the annexation of Mexican land, 400 military interventions since its foundation, one of the highest contributors to global warming, human rights violations, war crimes, and the list goes on. It came with the idea that America cannot be judged by the standards applicable to the rest of the world, the same standards it sets for others. Since World War II, under the pretext of nation building and promotion of democracy, the U.S. administration has been involved militarily in more than 15 countries, from China to Vietnam, to Libya, to Afghanistan, to Iraq. The very foundation of American dream, I argue, globally has been imperialism. This dream has turned functioning countries like Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan. into failed states. It supported Saddam Hussein, then took him out. Financed the Mujahideen, then bombed them to smithrin, was allied with Qaddafi, then left him to crowds. Fought against the Taliban, then handed the country in plate. America's global ambition has been the cause of world disorder, the destruction of Middle East, and the starvation of millions. Let's look into the nightmares of Afghanistan. Since the invasion of 2001, the Afghan people had to pay a colossal price for American dream of 50,000 civilian casualties, displacement of millions of Afghans and the destruction of billions of infrastructure. Between 2016 to 2022, 2,122, 1,122 air strikes were conducted, 3,67 casualties, all civilian, 40% of which were children. with their talk about freedom, democracy and justice, members of the House, it's your responsibility to remind them of August 2021. After 20 years of war, Afghanistan handed back towards Taliban. Remind them of the moments of crowds rushing towards a close gate. Children pushed against barbed wires. Desperate people clinging towards airplanes and falling from the sky just to leave the country. remind them that in Afghanistan, their dream turned into nightmare in the form of war crimes, human rights violations, and crimes against humanity. Spencer, you can always WhatsApp me. Let's look into Iraq, where the American dream of oil turned into a nightmare. Iraq's invasion was again, packages delivering America's values of freedom, democracy, and justice. Well, it has been 19 years since Iraq. Iraq was invaded. But ever since chaos and destruction have clashed the cradles of this old and magnificent Mesopotamian civilization, it was the invasion in the Iraq that led to the formation of ISIS. ISIS would not have existed and had not been for the US to invade Iraq. The real American dream in Iraq was about what? Oil. To quote Defense Secretary Chuck Hegel, people say we are not fighting for oil. Of course, we are. Libya is another example of America's nightmare. Eight years after the start of U.S.-led military intervention, the Awerp Qatabe to promote stability, Libya is still in civil war. But amid all this chaos, one will expect accountability and the rule of law from the United States. And that has not been seen either. Where was the accountability when the international criminal court wanted to investigate and prosecute the United States for war crimes in Afghanistan? Instead of facing justice, Trump imposed sanctions on the families of ICC officials. However, when it comes to Russia, China and Iran, America is the first one to ask for accountability. From the same court, it wanted to impose sanctions on. What about the accountability from Gautan, the Mubay and the undisclosed locations where hundreds of prisoners were taken? The physical abuses, torture, rape and killings in the Abu Ghari prison in Iraq are still fresh in the memories of millions of Iraqs. This is what the American dream has been for the world for the last 20 years alone. But my second argument is this, that the American dream will be always a nightmare because their dream is based on a war economy and corporate greed. While America projects itself, abation of peace, heaven of democracy and concord, in reality, war is necessity for the pursuit of American dream. American economy is a war economy. It maintains hegemony in the world through war. Its science and technology are deeply entrenched in the military machine. The 20-year war was an extraordinary success for the American military complex, composed of private dealers, lobbyists, and Pentagon officials. The U.S. has the largest share of global armed market for the 18 years of the past 20 years. 61% of the global arms sales in 2019 came from the United States. But here are some eye-opening. facts and statistics from Brown University Center for International Policy Report. And this is what they provide. Pentagon spending has totaled over $14 trillion since the start of the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, with one-third to one-half of the total going to military contractors. The U.S. has half of the world's 10 largest military defense contracts, contractors, and 43 of the 100 defense companies. One third of all Pentagon contracts in the last 10 years have gone to five companies. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raython and Northrop Grumman. The arm industry used ample tools at its disposal to influence decisions over Pentagon spending. The industry has spent 285 millions in campaign contributions since 2011 in presidential elections, congressional elections and the House of Senate. Now, but it is more than that. One third of the Senate members of the Defense Subcommittee, of the Appropriation Committee, own stock of the top five defense contractors. 51 members of the Congress and their spouses own between 2.3 and 5.8 million worth of stock in the companies there are among the world's top 30 defense contractors. Four of the past five U.S. secretaries of defense came from one of the top five armed contractors. For example, Trump administration secretary of defense, James Matts, came from board members of general dynamics. Biden's administration defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, board member of Raytheon Technologies. Members of the House, Mr. President, $2.3 million was spent in Afghanistan. 87% went to the top five defense contractors. And out of the $2.3 trillion, only a fraction spent on rebuilding, and 80 to 90% went back to the U.S. economy through this company. And the biggest and most controversial market for the U.S. weapon in recent year has been the Middle East, where the weapons have been used for killings of masses and millions of Yemenis who are starving to death at the hand of blockades. But to come to my conclusion, as you can see, the American dream is based on war economy, doomed to bring nightmares for the world. Outside this border, the freedom to dominate, humiliate and subjugate, usually in the service of America's real religion, the free market has been the successful story of American dream. It is a global bully who possesses the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction, chemical, biological and nuclear. It has fought the most wars, account for most human rights violations in modern history, and has sponsored, armed and financed, untold numbers of dictators and despots. And to quote Jonathan Turley, war may be held for some, but it is heaven in a war-dependent economy. And that has been the case for American dream. The opposition would go and glorify America as the savior and protector against Russia, China, Iran, and other despotic countries. But be aware, members of the House. Don't be misled. Remind yourself of the global nightmares of the American contractors of Afghanistan, of Iraq, of Libya, of millions of people who are starving at the hands of American foreign policy. Remind of the only country who has used nuclear. nuclear bomb in this world, none other than America. That is what American dream is for you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much.
