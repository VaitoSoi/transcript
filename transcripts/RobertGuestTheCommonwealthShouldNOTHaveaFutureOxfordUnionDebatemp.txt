 I now look to Robert Guest for an editor for The Economist to continue the case for the proposition. But before he begins, may I just remind you that photography and videos are not permitted in the chamber. You'll have to subscribe to our YouTube instead. Thank you. Well, I feel outgunned, not only because of the brilliance of Gia's speech, but also because of the eminence of the other two gentlemen who I am speaking against. Not one but two members of the House of Lords, a mere journalist, in a country that has discovered this week, perhaps rather too late, that if this one sort of person you don't want running things, it's a journalist. But I'll do my best. So, the Commonwealth. For all that previous speech, Speaker suggested, it can't get away from its history. It is the relic of an empire. And what kind of an empire? Well, far too complicated for me to do justice to in the time I have available. but I can say a couple of things about it. Firstly, that it was exploitative. I know, yes, some of the people who went out to found the empire thought that they had a duty to civilize the savages by teaching them the Bible or something like that. But actually, Joseph Conrad knew what he was talking about when he described the whole European imperial venture as the vilest scramble for Lute that ever disfigured the conscience of the human, no, the history of the human conscience. There you go. And Lute, you ever wonder why we use the Hindi word Lute to describe the spoils of war? I suggest you go and have a look at some of the stately homes that Robert Clive built when he got back from running India, and by an amazing coincidence, was the richest self-made man in Europe. Empire was not only exploitative, it was built on coercion. The basic proposition was, hand over your country or we'll shoot you. And if, if like me you've ever stood on the plains of Omdouman in Sudan and contemplated what happened there, it was a place that really demonstrated how the empire was about power coming from the barrel of a maxim gun. The principle was that the British Empire had guns and strategy that the rest of the world didn't. So on that plane, slightly more than a century ago, 12,000 Africans were shredded with machine gun bullets so that foreigners could take their country. Was that fair? The empire was shot through with cruelty as well. when the Indians rebelled against British rule, the English response was to tie them if they caught them over the edge of cannons and blow them away so that they could scatter their body parts far and wide so their families couldn't give them a decent burial. The empire was also based on racism. Don't take my word, Borat, take the word. words of the people who ran the place. Cecil Rhodes. I don't know if you've heard of him. But there's a reason why people want to pull down his statue, not just in Oxford, but in all the countries he'd ran before. He said, very explicitly, that the Anglo-Saxon race was the best race in the world and the more of the world that they occupied, the better off humanity would be. Perhaps he was atypical. After all, This was a man who made a colossal fortune out of peddling this sort of nonsense. But no, he wasn't atypical at all. Kim Wagner, the historian, tells one story there are many one could pick of just an ordinary Mem Sahib in India about a century ago. She was walking along, and her servant saw that she was about to tread on a poisonous snake. And he rushed over and grabbed her by the shoulder, to stop her from treading on that snake. And she acknowledged afterwards writing in her memoirs that had he not done so, she would certainly have died. But, you know, it was a brown man touching a white woman. So she sacked him and threw him out into the street. That is the foundation from which the Commonwealth has sprung. Now, that doesn't settle the case at all. Almost any institution that is old has grubby foundations. What I would say is that the historical argument does not settle it, because out of roots that are grubby, good things can grow. Britain's Parliament, as I mentioned, used to be a place that was elected entirely by rich men and passed laws saying that it was okay to burn heretics, witches, and hang gay people. Now, it's evolved into something clearly better, a more or less functioning elected chamber. The good things can grow out of bad roots, but with the Commonwealth, have they really done so? What's it for? I've reported from 26 out of the 54 Commonwealth countries, including all the large ones except Bangladesh. I've spoken to presidents, to laborers, to scientists, to engineers, to cattle herders. Not one person has ever said to me, we have a problem, let's call the Commonwealth. Most of the citizens of the Commonwealth don't even know what it's for. In one poll, a quarter of Jamaicans said they thought that the head of the Commonwealth was Barack Obama. It does do some good things. The Commonwealth Games are quite fun. Some of the scholarship programs are pretty good. But if you look at its main claims for what it does, and remember, this is an organization that represents nearly a third of humanity, so you'd expect it to achieve something pretty big. It claims to have played a decisive role in the dismantling of apartheid, and yes, it did speak up loudly and boldly against why. white supremacy in South Africa, and for that I saluted. But how influential was it? Back in the 1980s and 90s, everyone with an ounce of moral sense was making the same case. If you read perhaps the definitive account of why apartheid ended, Pathy Waldmeyer's great book, Anatomy of a Miracle, 300 pages, there's not one mention of the Commonwealth. Doesn't seem to have been terribly influential. Another claim that the is that it boosts trade between its members. No doubt my friends will tell you that that's wonderful statistic, the Commonwealth advantage that it's cheaper and easier than you would expect if there were no other bond between countries, the Commonwealth countries to trade with each other. But is it the Commonwealth that's the bond, or is it simply the fact that they very often have a common language and a common or similar legal system? I personally think that the so-called Commonwealth trade advantage is illusory and would remain were the Commonwealth organization to be dismantled. What's that one? That's one minute left. Okay. It claims to stand up for human rights. It does, but does anyone listen? It's suspended Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth for rigging an election and the ruling party carried on doing so regardless. It is possible for any organisation to reform. but there are opportunity costs. I propose something very simple. Take the entire budget of the Commonwealth and all the money that all the member states spend flying their members to luxurious Commonwealth conferences and spend it instead on vaccinations for poor children. This is something that we know is incredibly effective. It saves lives, and for every one pound you spend on it, you get 50 pounds of benefits. Can any of you, in good conscience, say that that would not be a better use, of the funds. If you can't, I urge you to support the motion. And I believe I've got to yield my time to the other side. And really, what more appropriate person could I hand over to? To defend an outdated institution that survives by pure inertia, a member of the House of Lords. Thank you.
