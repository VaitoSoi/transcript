 Thank you. Thank you so much for joining us, Mr. Feng So it's really, really an honor. I guess I wanted to start. I wanted to start all the way back to your childhood, if we can. So you were born in Xi'an China in the late 1960s. How would you kind of characterize your childhood in the China of that time? That's a surprise question to me. It's something I really want to talk about. important. I grew up in the suburb of Shi'an. My memory of my hometown is of the beautiful mountain to the south, that's Chinling Mountain, and the busy city to the east, that's Shi'an, and the tombs of the past emperors to the west and north. So it's rich in history. There's a legend that if we just deep enough, we'll definitely find something about history, some antics. And that really happened actually when I was a kid. So in China, we were, like at that time, we were second-class citizen. We were farmers, peasants, by birth. And to me, that's something that's always in my mind. Even when I was very little, I always think about it. You know, who am I? Why I'm here today, you know, as a second class citizen in this country, I was a precious reader. So I basically self-taught myself reading a lot of things. And my first enlightenment of the political events was actually in 1970s. the first Tiananmen movements that actually was a protest against Mao at that time. Even though in the beginning the government brainwashed us into believing that it was a riot. But when I read the poems of these rioters, I was really inspired because one of the poems says, Qin Huang's of the sikhue, it's ae, that means the age of the emperors is long past. We are in the age of a new beginning or people, we want to know and we know. So that's like the first paddle for me. How can these rioters write such beautiful poems? beautiful poems that was like my first impression you know that's such a lovely story so that kind of segues into what I wanted to ask next which was had you always kind of been an activist from childhood do you have maybe early memories of going to protest or being interested in politics and government affairs I know you mentioned the 1976 stuff but how did you sort of develop your initial interest in and politics? To me, I think a lot of it's from reading. At that time, China was very different from today. This was between the time of the end of the so-called culture revolution and the 80s, where everything is about reform, change. I read a lot about history and I learned English basically by reading. I could reset the speeches of Lincoln and of the lot of famous people as a way to learn English. So that's where I get my inspirations from. As I mentioned before, I always was very keenly aware of of the social injustice in China, even though I grew up as a student, like, you know, being chosen for studying mathematics, physics, for being smart at these things. But I was just a very precious reader. Yeah, that's great. So at university, you chose to study physics, and you chose to go to university in Beijing, which is quite in a different part of China from where you grew up. How is going to university viewed by your family? Were they very supportive of your higher education pursuits? And where you were from, did a lot of people go on and go to university at that time? Yeah, to me going to Qinghua University, I was actually chosen by Qinghua, admitted without entrance exam, which was quite an honor at that time. And that was the first time. for Qinghua to do this in my hometown. So it was quite a news, especially because I was the only one who grew up in the rural area, as a poor farmer's son. So that was quite, to me, that quite welcome change. But on the other hand, it was a good, It was very difficult, definitely, for a lot of people to choose. Initially, I think my first challenge was earlier when I graduated from middle school. There was an opportunity that I could choose to go to that time so-called technology school directly. That means I will change my social status from a farmer into being like a, one of the government supported people. Because my family were very poor at that time. If I choose to keep going, I study, going to high school for three years, that means lots of money and lots of uncertainty, and they couldn't pay for it. So that was a very difficult choice. choice, but my mother, my sister, was very, they were both very supportive. I think it's because of their support that I could finish high school later and have the chance of going to Chin Hua. Yeah, and when you went there, you didn't hold back at all, so you chose to run and you were elected as leader of Beijing's students' autonomous Federation. What would you say inspired that decision? And would you kind of characterize yourself as a natural leader? Or was this a step out of your comfort zone and something that you had to work towards at the time? It was definitely later. I even though I was very interested in politics and I was angry at the social injustice imposed on us, on people like me. I was mostly just an individual. But then when the protest broke out, I feel like there was a need. For example, on the day of the eve before, that's the day before Huyaoban's memorial. near Tianmen Square, there were thousands of people from Qinghua University gathered together. Just people were eager for protests, but there was no leader. I said, well, you know, if someone has to step up, so I will. So that's how I meet the decision. Yeah. Yeah. And you definitely did step up, I think. You ended up being known for promoting democracy across your entire university campus and beyond in the 80s. What was your kind of conception or definition of democracy in Beijing at that time? And in terms of today's world, how does democracy look similar or different to you? Yeah, we know we want democracy and at that time we were actually very aware. that this could be the last opportunity we can practice democracy. So at Qinghua University, even though everything has to be at-hoc, spontaneous, because it's happening so fast, we try to practice as much possible. For example, we have this student parliament, so that's from the representatives of the representatives of the every class and we call it Shigei Da Hui. The Congress meeting at Shijie the big room where about 400 representatives from class could come and decide on major issues and then we have like this executive committee where we are supposed basically to follow what's dictated to us us by the student parliament. That's how we practiced democracy. Of course, even before that we had an opportunity at physics department. I organized, I think that's the first only direct election of the student union there. That's probably the only time we could do it. But even without any experience, we did it wonderfully. There was the campaign, there was debates, and there was this election. I was really inspired by the passion, you know, just people show immediately. They like it. They want to elect their own representatives. They feel being empowered. And they are joyful in the process. Even it's just an election of a student union at department level. To me that was one major factor for later becoming a leader during the student protests. And do you think democracy today can be promoted in the same way or how is the idea of democracy changed from then? I think the idea of democracy remains the same. You know, it's based on human freedom and the dignity and we want participation. Of course, the decision making process can be changed. Yeah, right? for example for China whether the like presidential system or parliamentary system will be better we don't really know yet yeah but I think the essence is still the same and for China I think that's very important yeah definitely so you also are credited with advocating for freedom for student newspapers at the time and you started the voice of students radio How did these sort of tools help you in spreading and promoting democracy at the time? Yeah, this was extraordinary time. Actually, today I just posted a newspaper from People's Daily 33 years ago. It's the official mousepiece of the Chinese government. And it's coverage of the student movement. It's unbelievable, it's truthful. That's like the first and only time in China's history. For me, I was happy to be part of it, especially through the voice of the students' station. Because of the technical expertise of Qinghua student, we were able to build a very huge, broadcasting station we had like dozens and dozens of loud speakers on the monument at the center of the square we are able to cover the whole square with our voice even with you know everything going on with ambulance coming in and out at every five minutes and to me this was like the time where freedom was so close it's in the air and you can hear the voice. If one thing I could remember, it's a voice from everywhere. It's all of a sudden, like everyone feels there's a chance. You can speak from your heart, and we are hearing it on Tianan Square, and people come there to speak from their heart. And just recently we are working on this project, TNNN, New Zealand, museum, we had this flag from that day, from that day 33 years ago. This is the flag from Shenzhen University, and it had the signature of 92 people from that day. And to me, I was in tears when I saw that, because it feels so familiar and so remote. And like one signature said the police from Beijing salute the students on TMS Square. And most people just today you couldn't imagine that. So that's why it's so important. Yeah. And I would say more broadly speaking, we've seen all over the world that, you know, freedom of the press and media goes hand in hand with democracy. How do you characterize media in China today? And given all the censorship and stuff that's going on, how can we move forward and improve that? Well, there's basically no media in China today. It's all just one voice and it's far from truth. It's everything that the government want to portrait. There's no connection to reality. connection to reality and it's a way of controlling people. Unfortunately, modern technology has enabled this government to control people to such a degree that's beyond the wildest imagination anywhere. Even just watching this from here, you just can't believe how much control there is and how sophisticated it. the system is in terms of brain washing people and changing reality. So, you know, I think for China, of course, it's much needed. It's very important to have the freedom of press. And that was the most important request of 1989. And that was echoed by the journalists at that time, you know, other than the students, the journalist was the most important groups. There were thousands of journalists marching on protest for freedom of press. And most of these, at that time, they belonged to the state-owned media. Just imagine that. So, but such voices, of course, are repressed, muted today. But on the other side, there's, this technology also enable people to express themselves, that is constantly being changed, just repressed by the government. For example, during the Shanghai lockdown in the last 60 days, we are seeing one of probably the worst human human, disaster in the world and people are trying every way to protest. For example, they would post the videos of this song, International. That was also famous song in 1989. And there's just like thousands, tens of thousands people were doing the same thing. Of course, you know, this is no comparison today in China against the government's control. Yeah, definitely. I think the biggest incident in your life though is probably the June 4th incident, after which you were arrested and were then at the top of the government watch list. Given that this is so significant, walk me through what was going, through your head at the time, you know, when you were arrested in Tianmen Square and afterwards, what were you thinking? Yeah, when I, uh, I saw my name on the TV for the first time, and it was the most wanted list. I was looking at these names as, oh, okay, these people sounds familiar, you know, Wang Dan, Wurkai Shi, Chilin, Liu Gao. And then it's me. I was really shocked. I never thought I belonged to the same league. But of course, I also had a deep sense of pride at that time, knowing that I had done something really worthwhile for my life to a great movement in China. But of course, I never know this was a very well. know this was the beginning of a long journey. Yeah. Well, you know, it was a long journey, I think, but at least after you were arrested, due to international support and things, you were able to be released a year later. What was that process like? And did you have faith that you would be released? Or was everything very much up in the air at the time? It was always up in the air. We never know. I was fortunate enough to be locked up with other students like me. So sometimes we play this like a mock court. We just look at this loss and sentence each other just for fun. So when it's my turn, you will say, well, you know, you would be fortunate if it's a 20 years in prison, because, you know, they were putting lots of people to death, immediate execution at that time. So I'm grateful to be a survivor. And a year later, I was released. Yeah, and after your release in exiles, like you said, you were very lucky, you were luckier than those you continued to be imprisoneded. But despite that, you very much struggled to earn a living afterwards. Did you ever contact your family at that time or look for support? And, you know, what was your mental state at the time? Did you think all the work that you put in to get released was worth it given that even outside of prison you were facing a large uphill battle in terms of finding yourself back on your feet? I think my life was probably easier than most of the protesters. It was fortunate for me to to meet people from all works of society who were really very sympathetic to me, even though I was the enemy of the state. Sometimes I was recognized on the street of my hometown, and people were always very supportive. So during my years in China, I was struggling, but I always had this deep, deep sense of confidence in the people, in Chinese people. I was also fortunate to be financially free very early because of the stock market that was at the very beginning. This was 30 years ago. I was able to make some money that's equivalent to 40 years of my salary. at that time, so that made a big difference. Yeah, and so while most of your life is characterized by, you know, your humanitarian work and your activist work, after you moved to the States, you decided to get an MBA and work in finance. What was kind of your motivation and inspiration behind that? You know, when I was first asked by someone after arriving in the United States, I said, okay I want to study political philosophy and then I was warned that nobody would support me so you know and then because some friends of my who escaped before me they were graduating from business school and I was told this is a quick way to support yourself and so at that time you know George Soros was kind of of my model, you know, I want to make some quick leave you, then just, yeah, support myself to do anything I want. Yeah, definitely. But in sort of interviews after your Tianmen Square incident and things like that, you've continued to state that you think the core issues that were being protested back in 1989 still remain unresolved, such as the government corruption in China. What do you think the way forward for China is? How do you think that some of these issues can be resolved? Yeah, I've been asked this question all the time. To be honest, I don't really have a concrete answer to every step, but I know it's very clear that China has to democratize. And for now, you know, China is going, like, accelerating in the opposite direction. That's a disaster to Chinese people, and that's also a disaster to the world. The pandemic we are experiencing now, you know, it's a result of government cover up, if it's not the lab work. There's definitely government cover-up that increase this problem. And the war today in Ukraine also is warning China's ambition for Taiwi. This is very close to us. So to me, as China has to democratize, it has to be a free society based on civil societies. with democracy, multi-party democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of price, rule of law, and people have to have the freedom of practice their faiths. And people must be allowed to choose their own destiny, politically or otherwise. Yeah, definitely. You've also said that a lot of China's political conflict is facilitated by a small percentage of families at the top of China that control the country. And I think indeed this is the case for a lot of wars and international conflict across the world. How do we as a world we reconcile this? And do you characterize yourself ever as someone who's anti-war or a pacifist perhaps? No, I love peace. I want to keep peace, but I'm not a pacifist. I think today we must face the reality of war. In the past, for example, people, the democratic countries have been too eager to appease to China and actually emboldened it to build up its military at lightning speed. For example, today China has the hypersonic missile, that's a combination of space technology and a nuclear weapon that's supposed to be more advanced than the United States, for example. So we must confront this reality first. Then we will have peace. This communist regime, they cannot be changed by goodwill. They can only be changed by, they must be confronted. the only answer to the power. Yeah. And, you know, in contemporary Chinese politics today, there's a lot of small conflicts that are occurring in various parts, but I'd say one of the most contentious is the China-Hong Kong situation. What do you sort of make of the conflict today? And given your philosophy of promoting peace, what would you advocate as the way forward for for China and Hong Kong? Yeah, I'm always grateful to people of Hong Kong. For the last 32 years, it was because of people of Hong Kong that the legacy of Tianmen has been preserved. They were carrying on the torch of freedom for China. for China, Hong Kong was the China we want China to be, but now it's the other way. China is making Hong Kong like Xinjiang or Tibet. That's a very sad situation. I, in 2019, three years ago, after my visit, here. A few months I tried to go to Hong Kong to participate in the protests. And I was rejected at the airport. They grabbed me seven people. They tried to push me on a wheelchair to send me back to the United States and I was bleeding. So I couldn't go to Hong Kong. My heart is always with these people who fight for freedom. Like Li Juerren, Cai Yau Chang, Zhou Xin Tong, Joshua Wong, who spoke here like two years ago. It's very tragic to see how Hong Kong could change in the last three years. This was one of the worst backward development in the world. But this is like beginning. It's not the end of China's expansion. And next, it could be Taiwan or could be anywhere else. Just a few weeks ago, I was in Serbia. There were huge Chinese presence there. It was constructed like a military complex in Serbia. So this was like one aspect of one road, one belt. They are exploiting their presence. presses and with it, you know, their way of jolly. Yeah. I mean, you know, much like Hong Kong, I think Taiwan similarly remains another sort of conflict area for China and a contested sort of area. Do you think this warrants a similar solution or what's sort of your thoughts on the whole Taiwan situation today? Yeah, during 2019 and 2020, I went to Taiwan four times. The last time was in January to observe the general election. It was very moving for me to witness Chinese democracy directly. It's a way we hope China will be in the future. But to me, the biggest concern is that the United States has been ambiguous on whether they will defend China militarily, defend Taiwan militarily on a China invasion. So I think that is a big risk, and that's embolding Xi Jinping to make moves. I salute Ukrainian people for their fight against Russia, but a Ukraine victory over Russia will not deter Xi Jinping from invading Taiwan. So I think the democratic countries must be united and very clear defending Taiwan's democracy. That's only way we can achieve peace for long term. Definitely. So returning back to your personal life after 1989, you've returned to China in secret several times since then. Was this a difficult experience for you given that you couldn't really get in touch with your family? And do you think that you'll ever be able to get in touch and properly reconnect with your family? Yeah, that's a difficult question. For Chinese people, unfortunately, our families are always held as hostage against us. That's happening everywhere. And, you know, that's why, for example, Chinese people overseas support communists China and self-censor because they are afraid of their family in China being hurt because of their actions here. And of course to me it's more extreme. So as a way to protect them, I basically put a wall there. I try not to let them influence them. let them influence me in any way. That's the only way to protect them. And I also made it clear to the Chinese police when I was in China. I said, next time I come back to China, it will not be for visiting friends' family. It will be to continue my work for democracy and freedom in China. Yeah. Speaking of censorship, you were personally censored. censored by LinkedIn and by Zoom in 2019 and 20 respectively. What do you make of this? And how do you think this ties into broadly China's censorship practices today? Yeah, my name is always censored back in China. What's worse is that, you know, now basically all these multinationals are following China's order in terms of censorship. This was in year 2010 during the pandemic that everyone began to use Zoom. So we use Zoom to have like the first ever global online commemoration of TMN. And at that time, Zoom wasn't banned in China. So we have people from all over the world, including people from China participating. And a few days later, our account was censored. Later, FBI investigated. This was like the first time our grievance was hurt by US government when they investigated. later they indicted Zoom employee who was actually agent for China's secret police. And this person called Jin Xinjiang was giving orders on behalf of Chinese government to Zoom on censoring us. And yeah, if you haven't read it, I encourage you to read it. This is great work by the FBI agent and it's just laid out all the facts about this. What's more damaging is that the secret agent actually said that every company in China has business in China. So here we mean Western companies, there is such a person and such a mechanism. to make sure that they are following Chinese practice. So, you know, that's a kind of situation that we are facing. To me, of course, this is a continuous upward battle. We haven't got any compensation from Zoom for censoring us. And, you know, we'll keep trying to find new ways. For example, last year, I don't know if you know there was very popular new social platform called the Clubhouse. So during the Chinese New Year, last year, year 2021, Chinese were able to access it from within China. And so when I was talking about Tianan and Clubhouse, in every room, would fill up immediately. Thousands of people would come to listen. And this kind of person-to-person interaction, this was very heartwarming to me, to be able to hear from people within China. And you can see, like, no matter how hard, they try to brainwash, to set up this wall when we have this chance. to interact directly, we become friends. And that's why a few hours later, after I talked on Clubhouse, it was banned from China. Yeah, this is, for me, this is continuous battle. But it's an honor, too. I really, I really, Recently, I have this Tianan exhibition in my home gallery, in the basement. We have the blood-steined shirt from Tianan massacre. We have a tent that was brought out from the morning of June 4, and we had flags, and we also have leaflets from that time. Looking at this, I feel like I'm looking at the fire, the sacred fire for Chinese freedom. That's why I always believe it's an honor for me as a keeper of this secret fire. Yeah. And I'd say a lot of times this kind of secret fire comes from young people in a country and student activists such as yourself at the time. And the case of student activists facing police and government brutality such as you did is not a new one. I'd say across Asia, for instance in India as well, students from politically active universities are often seen being brutally beat in the streets of Delhi, for instance, and jailed afterwards. advice or words of wisdom would you give to young student activists that had that fire and are looking to make a change? Yeah, I think it's great to put your life at something you love so dearly and if you can, if there's any opportunity, you can do it. Don't waste it. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. With that, we've got some time for audience questions now. So if anyone in the audience has a question, if you could please raise your hand or with your membership card, and I'll look to you for your question. Let's start with the woman in the purple sweater. Yeah. You spoke a lot about being inspired by students who are students who are agitating for things that they believe in. But could you talk about how when you were a student activist, you responded to those people in China who didn't believe in the need for democratization or bought into the CCP's rhetoric and how you might address people who believe that today? Were you able to catch that? So she asked, yeah, the woman asked, how did you respond to people who sort of believed in CCP rhetoric at that time or didn't believe in the democratization of China. How do you respond to those people today? I think that was your question. I think that was your question. I think it's just, it's in our human nature to love freedom. And I think people in China probably are experiencing every day negatively. For example, people from Shanghai, they are afraid to talk about freedom, but they are realizing now that without freedom, without freedom of speech, they could not even feed themselves. You know, people are stopped to death in Shanghai. And I am I think China has to change and it will come. I would love to interact with anyone, person to person. Definitely, thank you. We're open for more audience questions. I look to the gentleman in the white shirts. Hi, thank you. Hello, thank you very much for telling us about your experiences. I have a question for you about Hong Kong. I was there in 2019, both before and during the protests, and I was really moved by the way that people really cared about democracy in Hong Kong. But as we have seen, during the protests, initially certain things got better, so the extradition bill was suspended, but now instead of we have the national security law, and perhaps some people will say that the protests were completely in vain, and that in fact the situation has got worse. And so I would be really interested to hear your perspective. What would you say to people in Hong Kong or elsewhere protesting? And what sort of protest you think could work? Because we've seen various types, what kind of protests would potentially work? And maybe what sort of things would you are not really helpful at all? Thank you very much. Thank you. That's a good question. I'd be thinking about that all the time. You know, for example, the failure of our protest 33 years ago, we didn't change China. And actually, you know, it went backwards, similar in Hong Kong. But if we If we are given another opportunity, shall I participate? Definitely, I still see it as my duty to push for the change I want. I don't think we can always achieve that immediately or directly. But it's our duty as our duty as as a human being to defend our dignity against such tyranny. And it may take years or decades to get there. But this is part of the journey, and we have to start somewhere. in terms of how it could succeed, I think with China it's probably impossible now, right, to realize. But even given the situation, we have to fight with any opportunity. And we have lots of people like that. We have thousands of political prisoners. And every year, people, would try to call for freedom and democracy. I think before China democratized, probably there will be more losing battles like this, and there must be people willing to fight, losing battles. If I can choose, I would love to be one of them before the final triumph. I think, Jimmy Lai said it really well in one of the interview, because we are human, we are not animals, we will fight for our freedom. So, you know, similar protests, for example, if you compare like the umbrella movement in 2014, Similar to that, there was sunflower movement in Taiwan that succeeded with the difference because there's democracy in Taiwan. There's no democracy in Hong Kong. That's the difference. That's the main difference. Thank you so much. Thank you. Looking for more audience questions and I recognize the women in the blue dress. First of all, it was an honor to hear you speak today. Thank you for your time. You alluded to earlier the almost double-edged sword that has been employed in utilizing the internet to either clamp down on speech or to facilitate it. So my question to you is what do you perceive is the pragmatic onus of responsiveness of responsibility? on democratic nations for carrying the torch of freedom with respect to freedom of speech in the digital age. There's so much conversation about regulations, about contingent speech, as it were on the internet, and I want to hear what your perspective is, again, and what a democratic country, anywhere in the world, what their approach should be for ensuring freedom of speech in a digital age. That's a very good question. I'm concerned about the freedom of speech in the democratic countries too, because the decision seems to be more concentrated now than before. And to me, that's not good. I think like maybe a decade ago, we were all hopeful because internet, you know, these self-publishing media supposed to empower individuals. Now it's the other way. I think the current situation is not ideal. I don't really have an answer to that. But I believe in competition and diverse choices and options. So I'm against concentration on that. And with regards to China, I think the Great Firewall, it's such a shame. You know, we have to remove it. And that should be a condition for any trade with China. That's my idea all that. Thank you. Thank you. We have time for one final audience question. I recognize the women in the penultimate row. Hi, thank you so much for your speech today. My question is kind of both personal and observation I have about young people around me because I'm from China and I was brought up there, but I'm studying the US. I think generally there is a cognitive distance between people who are educated and care about democracy or know its value versus how practically they choose to act. There are so much discontent, for example, by the Shanghai lockdown, or you see people going to Clubhouse to listen to you speak, or send articles that would be censored on WeChat, but that's almost the maximum people would be willing to act. Most of them would still either choose to stay outside of China so they can enjoy their rights or believe that there will be the lucky ones who will not be oppressed by the government, be politically apathetic and no change is born out of that. And I have to say personally, I'm sort of retreating into political apath. A political apathy. because of the massive helplessness I feel against the government. So based on others, I want to know what's your opinion on whether there's still grassroots support for democratic change in China, when the majority forces are becoming more and more apathetic. Yeah, that's a very good question. And that's a major obstacle we want to overcome as an organization, you know, we are losing our base, you know, because of the self-censorship of people. But I think my organization, humanitarian China, we have been relatively successful in building our community base, both in China and globally. We try to provide a low-cost way for people with empathy for political change to participate, to protect them from a government retaliation. And I believe there's a lot we can do without just requiring everyone to sacrifice. like their freedom immediately. There are a lot of ways that we can connect other than online, you know, to support, to contribute for the change. And I think it's very dark now concerning China and especially people of Chinese or arranging. arranging, but we have to act, but small steps will change. And we have some successful examples, but yeah, we do want to have an answer, but it will be achieved by interactions like this. That's why I love going out to campers to talk to people who are not political active, but who care about China's democratization. I believe there are ways for everyone to contribute according to their own risk tolerance. Yeah, definitely. I'm afraid that's all we have time for today. Thank you so, so much Mr. Feng Shuo, for sharing your insights and wisdom and your life with us. It's really been a great honor. And I'd like to invite the audience in joining me and thanking him for his time.
