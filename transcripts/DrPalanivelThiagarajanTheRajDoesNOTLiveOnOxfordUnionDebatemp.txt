 To close the case for the opposition, it been a great pleasure to invite onto the stage, finance minister Timil Nadu, Dr. Panaville Thigang Raja. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for inviting me and thank you for giving me this opportunity to close out this debate. It's been a very informative debate, but if you don't mind, I'd like to step back a little bit. In many ways, I wonder whether we live in an age of one reason. About ten days ago, the Supreme Court of India delivered two judgments, one after the other, which effectively said that the Constitution of India still applies. That's all it said. The Constitution of India still applies. This caused such great consternation about the GST and about the power of unelected officials and so forth that we had to pinch ourselves and say, are we still living in the real world? Do we live in the age of reason? A year and a half ago, in the United States, a bunch of people with heavy arms broke into a legislature and people are still arguing whether that was an insurrection or not. We live in an age of one reason. Since 2008, the global markets have had trillions of dollars of excess liquidity sloshed into them by central banks trying to keep asset values afloat. It's Cinderella land that has to come to an end. We don't know how, we don't know when, and yet it goes on for more than 13 years. We live in an age of one reason. closer to home during the lockdown a bunch of people get together in a room with a lot of bottles of alcohol and we are not yet sure whether there was a party or not we live in an age of unreason I say this because in this age of unreason here are all of us gathered today at great expense with the great tradition of this house debating whether something that is definitely dead has a ghost that still casts a shadow or not. Because that's effectively what we're talking about today. Just to make sure that I wasn't in delusion, I went and looked up the Encyclopedia Britannica. Question, does the British Empire still exist today? Answer, the British Empire does not exist today. So if it doesn't exist today, what we're really talking about is the ghost. And to set Professor Mukaji's mind at rest, much of this was scribbled on the back of napkins and planes and cars, but I will quote three pieces of wisdom greater than my own in the course of my speech. The first is from the Bard of Avon, from the speech of Mark Anthony at Julius Caesar's death, where he says that the east, The evil that men do lives after them. The good is often interred with their bones, and that is very true. Many have spoken today of the evils that the Raj left behind. But I'd also like to take a different philosophical approach, one closer to the Tamil culture that I come from, which was eloquently stated by Chillon of Sparta back in the sixth century, which said, of the dead, speak nothing but good. So since there's so much bad to say, I would rather not focus on that and just talk about whether the good really has been that good that we still attribute all our upside to the Raj. My fellow speaker pointed out that of the 1.4 billion Indians alive today, less than 1% maybe a million, a million and a half lived before independence, before partition. So certainly in the psyche of the people who live in the country, it doesn't exist. It's an apparition. It's a part of history. It's only readable in the books. My fellow speaker also spoke about the arduous process of creating a constitution. If it was just a cut and paste, it did not require 100 plus or 150 plus days of debate over two years to frame a constitution. That is really a written constitution. and a federal structure never seen in the United Kingdom before, which created states with their own powers, an equal level of government, divided by historical facts, artifacts that existed before the British ever came, differences in culture, differences in language and so on. So we have a constitution and a system that is quite different from what the British envisioned. And as another fellow speaker of mine pointed out, at the scope of Indian history of the thousands of years of our culture the flash of 150 years of the British Raj is nothing but an aberration, an instance. The history has a lot of negatives, as somebody else pointed out from the general audience. And this is our culture, our sins, our goods, our history, and the British Raj had not zero impact, but definitely not definitive, shaping impact on our progress. The population of India at partition was less than a quarter of what it is today. Whatever the systems that were built, be it education systems, be it infrastructure, be it schools, be it language, surely the systems of that day could not possibly be coping, could not possibly be providing for the scale of the country that we have today. In fact, if you look at the education systems by roughly around independence, my state of Tamil Nadu had the capacity to produce about 500 engineers a year. Today it has the capacity to produce 150,000 engineers a year. That was not built by the Raj. That was built by Indians between 1947 and now. We talk of language. We talk of language. Yes, we all speak English. But if you look across the states of India, you will find great disparities. There are parts of India where less than 20% of the people can speak English. There are parts of India where 80% of the people can speak English. If this was such an artifact of the Raj and uniformly applied, we should not see within 75 years such a disparity between two different states in the same country. We look at roads, ports, airports, hospitals, medical colleges, telecommunications. The bulk of progress that we have had, in India has come not just post-independence but post-liberalization, post-1991. Once we joined the global economy and once we opened up to free trade and investment is when all of these things have come. I would say this kind of development has wiped out any of the remaining artifacts of what the Raj did. My colleagues in the opposition to our position, but for the motion, spoke of law and the rule of law. I agree. There are archaic laws left behind in the books and they are misused by people who ought to know better who ought to serve better. But we have our own laws that are also misused. It is about the character of human beings. If not these laws, they would write other laws and we are rapidly reforming, at least in our government, we are certainly improving and rewriting new laws to replace those that were adopted as part of our constitution, even though they may be replicas, they were adopted as part of our constitution rather than that we operate under a British era law. It's just replicated into our constitution. In the world of sports, and I picked these topics because that's what in the debate's description, they talked about, education, language, infrastructure, rule of law, and sport. In sport, whether it is in tennis or cricket or squash or chess, Indians have increasingly dominated and that is post-1960s, 1970s and going up to today. That was not the case when there was the Raj. Finally, let me talk about industry. The whole system of industry under the British government was to source raw materials out of India, bring them to the homeland, add value to them and then use India as this big market in which to sell the value added product back. So they were getting on both sides of the trade. India has moved up the value chain. We used to sell cotton, then we used to sell thread, then we used to sell yarn, then we used to sell cloth, then apparel, now branded apparel. That kind of production was simply not possible. The British did not allow mechanization, did not allow value added production in India during the days of the Raj. The great carder of Indians who have gone around the world got educated, made their mark, not just in the UK, but in places like America, in Australia, in New Zealand. Wherever you look, there are Indians that have used all born post-independence, use the opportunity to go around the world and make a name and make a mark and make contributions to society. In the extent that we say that just because a ghost exists, it still lives, Then I must say that my friend, Mr. Tarur, he's not here, he's been quoted so many times. It's almost as if he lives in this house. So we cannot just say that the shadow reaches. In fact, let me conclude by saying that one of the surest signs that the ghost is dead is that the new version, the resurrection, has happened. If you look at it two ways, in the UK, the once colonized, have now taken over the kingdom. If you look at the cabinet today, whether it's the Treasury Secretary, the Home Secretary, junior minister in the foreign office, my good friend, now Lord Billy Moria, you look at people like this, the once colonized have now taken over the kingdom. The kingdom doesn't exert its power anymore. And if you look in India, we are well on our way to a Raj 2.0, run out of Delhi instead of run out of London. So in conclusion, let me quote this other great piece of literature, which in its first instance involved an alumnus of this college. It's from a piece of television history that you may all have seen and remembered. And so I say of the Raj, to paraphrase, it has passed on, it has ceased to be, it has expired and gone to meet its maker, bereft of life, it rests in peace. This Raj is an ex-artyfact of a bygone era of colonialism. Ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote against the motion and declare that the Raj is well and truly dead. Thank you very much. The
