 Thank you, everyone. It's an honour to be speaking tonight, and thank you so much for having me. So, this September marked the 10-year anniversary of the dating app, Tinder's release. Yeah, let's give it a woo. Though it followed gay dating apps, Grindr and Scruff, its 2012 launch is widely considered awarded shed moment in the normalising of hookup culture. And much like the sexual revolution of the 60s and 70s, the hope was that hookup culture would too usher in a new era of sexual liberation primarily for women one swipe at a time. So, what's happened in the 10 years since hookup culture was catapulted into the mainstream? Well, if the research is anything to go by, much of the same issues that affected our dating lives have either persisted or gotten worse. Now, a portion of criticism about hookup culture is undoubtedly driven by moral panic. But it is difficult to look at the shift at hooking up's prominence as a net positive. At least it certainly is in my mind. Now, I would like to make clear from the outset, I am not against hookups, no string situations, or friends with benefits as concepts. Some of the best sex and stories come from flings, and one-night stands. Indeed, a few of my friends were actually surprised to see me arguing for this side of the debate. However, I do take issue with hook-up culture's ubiquity. Its rise as the main form of romantic interaction generationally, rather, and its proliferation. Hook-up culture has long been positioned as something to liberate women from the sexist shackles of sexual conservatism. Women's desires, wants and needs prioritised in a dynamic that understands that women are also sexual beings and equally deserving of sexually fulfilling experiences. In theory, it allows women to positively explore sexual identities outside of the confines of a committed relationship. Except in its current form, certainly between men and women, this isn't always the case. The rise of hookup culture hasn't led to a decline in slut-shaming, as has been argued, or the erosion of sexist double standards. Just last month, videos unpacking women's body count, the number of individuals that they've slept with, were watched over 500 million times on TikTok. In a vast sum, the higher a woman's body count was, the more vitriol there was for her in the comments. So it's unsurprising that, as has historically always been the case, women were more likely to minimize the number in question and men more likely to over-index. As Marie Bergstrom notes in her book, The New Laws of Love, her female interviewees were drawn to the cladestine, covert nature of dating apps that ensured a lack of proximity from peers, because at the end of the day, they still feared being judged. Now, this is quite different to the sexually-empowered, future that defenders of hookup culture normally depict. By and large, women are still treated as though sex is something that they lose or something that they give up, and men still treat women often as notches on bedposts and sex as something to score. The power play that hookup culture hope to erode remains, and the language around these interactions rarely depicts a mutual exchange. Women are still treated as though sex takes something from them, as if they're left walking around with missing parts of themselves after an encounter like anthropomorphic Swiss cheese. Then there is what I think is perhaps the biggest travesty of hookup culture. It's exacerbation of what it was alleged to fix. The idea has been that since sex is now more accessible, more sex is being had. And more sex should essentially mean better sex. Practice makes perfect, right? But hooking up is not creating better sex. It doesn't even mean that people are having more of it. Instead of creating a sexually equal landscape, the orgasm gap for women remains as wide as it ever was. In a study with responses from over 12,000 undergraduates, it was noted that in fast time hookups, 31% of men and just 10% of women reached orgasm. Comparatively, in their last committed relationships, 85% of men and 68% of women reached orgasm. This is also reflected in research presented at the International Academy of Sex Research that also showed women are more likely to orgasm whilst in serious relationships compared to hookups. Men have also been found to be less likely to perform oral sex than women are during a hookup. Now, in her book American Hookup, the new culture of sex on campus, Lisa Wade outlines the typical rules for a hookup. No feelings. Don't get attached. Don't be jealous when they sleep with someone else, that old nutshell. Don't be awkward or insecure about sex. Don't act like you're all that into them. Don't want to see them all that much. Don't get upset if they don't text again. Now, please do excuse my French, but the term fuck buddy seems to have fallen out of fashion, perhaps because even the expectation of friendship in this dynamic is considered too much. The dreaded catching of feelings is deemed scarier than catching STIs. I'm serious. Just look at the research. A study of 71 college students found that nearly half of participants were not concerned about contracting sexually transmitted diseases during hookup, and the casual nature of these arrangements means multiple partners at once, so it makes the risk of catching them substantially higher. Wade argues hookup culture tells students that their frontal lobes are in charge, that they can be logical about sex and control their feelings if they choose to. Hucking up, they claim, can and should be, emotionless. Now, this lack of emotion, as well as the vulnerability and trust that hookup culture tends to prohibit, can make communication about sexual wants within a casual dynamic, substantially more difficult. The International Academy of Sex Research found that some women felt uncomfortable being honest about their sexual desires with the men that they don't know well. And on the flip side, men's standards tend to slip when it's women that they don't know. I'm not going to try as hard when it's with someone I don't really care about, said a 26-year-old man quoted in the New York Times article about this study. It's been argued that hook-up culture is part of a broader move towards individualism in the West, and this certainly checks out to me. The other person's pleasure and feelings are often demoted in pursuit of one's own, and because of this, hookups rarely facilitate the environment that's often needed to create the best sexual encounters. There is a level of emotional intelligence required that's been actively and at times aggressively eroded from these pseudo relationships. Wade continues. The skills needed for managing hookup culture are in direct contradiction to the skills needed to propose, build and sustain committed relationships. Now, I would personally add to that that these are also skills required for good sex. So much of hooking up relies on a lack of openness that is usually required to communicate sexual desires in order to have fulfilling experiences. The emotional policing, feigned nonchalance, the attempts to out aloof the other party are often draining. But also, they tend to undermine one of the primary reasons why most people, rather most single people, tend to have sex, which is fun. People live in constant fear of being labelled needy or clingy if one accidentally blurs the often liquid boundaries of what a hookup constitutes as. Anyone who deviates from this, man, woman, non-binary, is seen as a loser in a game, sorry, is seen as a loser of a game that all parties involved will not admit to playing. and regardless of the stereotypes, genuine connection is probably something that men don't need less of given recent reports of a burgeoning loneliness crisis. Casual sex is not impossible. It's not even undesirable, but it is not being navigated in the best way in the current landscape. For many, emotions of some kind do arise and the mismanagement of them leads to confusion for all parties involved. Daters are now being bogged down with a new set of neuroses in relation to these ill-defined relationships. New bad dating habits have emerged and every week there is a new article about another toxic dating trend whether it be ghosting, zombieing, breadcrumbing or various other equally, strangely titled but strained interactions. So many people are turning their backs on it. Sorry, many people are turning their backs on it because it's not working for them. It's well documented that millennials are having less sex than generations before them, but Gen Z are also reportedly going through a similar sex recession. Members of the so-called celibacy TikTok have tired of the emotional repression required for hookups and go as far as arguing that casual sex is in itself oxymoronic. Whilst I might not agree entirely with that, it's assertion, I do agree with the idea that people are feeling increasingly objectified and used by experiences that should be mutually beneficial and enjoyable. The real sexual revolution, it would seem, is happening independently with women increasingly exploring their sexuality alone and without shame during masturbation. What is that my time? I have no idea how this bell system works. Oh, okay, thank you. So part of the hysteria in relation to, hookup culture is a backlash against feminism's gains and that's no doubt. The new sexual landscape brings us closer to a world in which sex is viewed without a puritanical lens. That being said, it's inaccurate to write everyone off that is critical as pole clutches. Most women I know are, like myself, not arguing against it from an ethics point of view, but rather looking at the present state of affairs and wanting more for all parties involved. Many of its supporters engage with what hookup culture should look like as opposed to what it currently does look like in actuality. In Donna Fratis' book, The End of Sex, she claims that hookup culture promotes bad sex, boring, sex, drunken sex that you don't remember, sex you couldn't care less about, sex where desire is entirely absent, sex that you just have because everyone else is. And she suggests that sex itself is becoming more mechanical as a result of so much repression of emotion. Whether it be within a relationship or outside of one, men and women deserve universally great sex, but has hookup culture brought us closer to this goal? The answer is, in my opinion, broadly no, and I cannot personally defend its virtues until it's an emphatic yes, yes, yes. Thank you.
