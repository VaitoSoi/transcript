 Mr President, Members, thank you very much for invitation and your very generous hospitality. Well, what a week to have such a debate! The foresight of this Oxford Union never fails to amaze me, ahead of the curve as usual. Psychic, almost. And of most import, ahead of the Cambridge Union. who I understand aren't even discussing this until at least next week. Now, in 2014, I was here debating in this very place on this very issue of Scottish independence, and at least I've lasted the distance. As Arnie Schwarzenegger says, I'm back, and I'm delighted to be back. And as I'm the only returning, female, and accordingly redeeming feature of tonight's debate, I'm qualified to tell you that your predecessor, in 2014 voted against the proposition on Scottish independence. Now, I am sure you, the class of 2023, don't wish to be tied to such egregious errors of judgment as a result of such lack of wisdom on the part of those students who went before you at this great institution. You can change that course and the course of history tonight. And I'm going to ask you just for this evening to imagine. imagine. Imagine for the duration of my speech that you're a Scot and that as a matter of choice not of birth. I'm a Chelsea born person to a Welsh mother and Pakistani father but I am a proud Scott and I know you all hail from far and wide. But to listen to what I have to say and to vote on this proposition with your heart and your head, you need to feel like you're a Scott, entrusted with your nation's future. Now in 2014, the people of Scotland just a week in advance of the historic vote on the 18th of September, when the latest poll demonstrated that the majority of Scots would vote, yes, we were presented with the Better Together campaign coalition of Tory, Labour and Liberal Democrats with the vow in Scotland. It was a joint statement by the then-leaders of the three main political unionist parties. The three amigos, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, remember them. Yes, well, they dashed up to Scotland, even abandoning Wednesday's Prime Minister's questions, the highlight of the House of Commons to get up the road as our imperial masters, promising more powers for Scotland. Well, have I included a promise that extensive new powers would be delivered? I don't know if all of you here this evening with your great intellect and foresight would have believed them. But what I do know is that you would feel angry and disappointed. a promises made to you were not delivered. That is natural. So I want to use this opportunity to present you with some of what was promised or threatened at that time and what the actuality was. And why in every election since 2014 the people of Scotland have continually mandated politicians to have a fresh vote? The better together broken promises are many, so many a myriad of them. It's almost difficult to understand where to begin. But enough to tell you. this group of Oxford students not to repeat the error of your predecessors. So let's take a few highlights. On Europe, we were told by better together. What is the process of removing our EU citizenship? Voting yes to independence. In 2014, the former Secretary of State for Scotland Alastair Carmichael said, the only way to leave the European Union is to leave the United Kingdom. The reality, well, two years later there was a referendum and Scotland voted remain by a whopping 62%. So what has happened as a direct result of voting no to independence is the absolute opposite. Scotland's been dragged out against our will. On the welfare state, Gordon Brown, remember him, former Prime Minister? He said our UK welfare state offers protections for pensioners, the disabled and the unemployed. The reality is quite different. In 2016, UK government cuts meant 14,000 disabled people lost their special allowances, resulting them having their disability cars taken away from them. And according to the human rights watch, tens of thousands of families in the United Kingdom each year are turning to food banks. People in work, our nurses, are using food banks. What is so better together about that? And on Home Rule, we were promised via that, by the, we'd have extensive Devo Max Powers, former UK Prime Minister. Again, Gordon Brown promised home ruler Debo Max and former Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie, your predecessor, pledged to make this party his party the guarantors of change after the referendum. Yeah, right. The reality, a year later, nothing had changed. No vow was delivered in totality, and in fact, I was a member of the House of Commons when that Scotland Bill was going through. And every single solitary one of those 120 amendments tabled by us was rejected. And now Gordon Bryan has come up with something else, a new set of proposals which has been dismissed by his own election agent as old and stale, much like some of the speakers this evening. Now ladies and gentlemen, if you cannot, if you cannot convince your old election agent, how can you convince Scotland? On energy, we were told there will be lower energy bills for Scotland if we stay in the UK. Lower energy bills for Scotland. Let me say that again. Lower energy bills for Scotland. The reality is the average bill in Scotland is greater than the rest of the whole of the United Kingdom. On food prices. Better Together warn that food prices would increase as a result of independence. Well, the reality, according to ONS, estimates published for January this year, show food costs in the month leading up to January 23 are up 30. So there we have it, just some of the promises made to the people of Scotland. Broken promise after broken promise. Yes, I'll take it just to add to the evening. There are lots of problems in this past. The answer is in and solved. Because I don't know, actually, you can't really solve the problem. It's also like the empty promises of the name in the past. Sure, they're broken, but having the picture. with the system, what I'm sorry in civility. Thank you very much indeed for your point and I would have to say that living in a country that's seen four prime ministers and almost as many chances in the United Kingdom fills me with no confidence that the UK is capable of doing anything on its own. Every disaster that the opponents of independence claim would happen with independence have actually happened with the Union. And here they are once again you'll hear the tardile arguments. Is this array of gentlemen before us tell us the tired old stories of why we'd be better in the union that speak nothing more of negativity and poverty of ambition. There's an old saying, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Well, the people of Scotland are not fools and neither is this august debating chamber. It's not about the past, it's about the future. It's not about fear, it's about hope. It's not about tradition, it's about ambition. It's not about greed, it's about fairness. And it's not about individuals, it's about the nation. It's not about control, but it is about freedom. Vote for the proposition. Thank you. You know,
