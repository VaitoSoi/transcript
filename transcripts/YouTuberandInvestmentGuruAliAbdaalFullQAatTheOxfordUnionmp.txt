 So welcome to the better university. Thank you. I hope your journey here was nice. It's a very nice place you've got here. A bit bigger than your chamber at Canada, doesn't it? It's huge. And it's very echoy. Yes, yes. And there's a library. The library is so nice. I am the librarian, so I take that as the highest compliment. Incredible. I suppose we want to start at the beginning, describing your YouTube journey. Can you take us back to when it started, when the idea came from the timeline? Yes. So when I was like 10 years old was when, no, it wasn't 10, maybe like 12. That's when I started getting addicted to YouTube and watching these like, oh why, it's really echoy, covers of popular songs, so people like Kurt Schneider in Boyce Avenue would do these like, you know, sick covers of pop songs. And I decided I was going to become a music YouTuber. Because I had a bunch of friends who were really good at singing songs, and I fancied the idea of learning lots of musical instruments. So I could make music videos out of them. And so for the next several years, like sort of half-assed this, tried to make a video here and there, a little music video as everyone did when we were all teenagers. But randomly then, like a decade later, a decade later when I was in my fifth year, so penultimate year of medical school, I'd been running this business that helped people get into medicine through courses, and I thought, you know what, why don't I make videos about it as well? Because there weren't that many videos online at the time about how to apply to med school. So I thought, hey, if I can do this, then maybe that would be useful, and maybe people would sign them to my course. And so what started out as a sort of marketing strategy for the business, within a few videos, I was like, oh, that's actually quite fun. Why don't I also vlog my holiday when I happened to be in Cambodia doing some medical thing. So I did that and that was fun. And then I thought, why don't I vlog life as a medical student? And that was fun. And at each stage it was like, why not just do the next thing? And then people started to follow the videos and we had a thousand subscribers. And eventually just sort of snowballed into this sort of ridiculously large thing that I could never have predicted five years ago when I started. And it's now meant that I can quit my job and continue to disappoint my mom. Do you still do any music, YouTubeing? Not quite. dabble with it on Instagram. I'll occasionally bust out the guitar, sing a song on Instagram. Some comments will be like, oh my God, you're incredible. Some comments will be like, please stop singing. And so, you know, you get a good mix of kind of ego boosting and ego depletion when it comes to Instagram. Where within your sort of, the way your channels changed over the last five years, do you think you found your niche? And how would you describe your niche on YouTube? Yeah, that's the thing. I don't really have a niche. I now help other people grow their YouTube channels and the idea of like what is your niche always comes up. I think this is always a thing when people are starting a YouTube channel or a podcast or writing anything or even starting any kind of business is like what is the value that you're providing. I think the nice thing about YouTube is that what you can do is you can kind of just make videos about whatever you want and if people resonate with the way that you make the videos then it just tends to kind of do well. But I guess pulling it back, like I realized through university and through working for two years as a doctor that I really enjoyed teaching. Like teaching was ultimately my jam and I enjoyed teaching medical students a lot more than actually practicing medicine. And so when I started thinking all these big questions about like, well, what do I actually want to do with my life? What's my purpose? Why am I here? All this stuff. I landed on kind of being a teacher as like this feels like the thing that's truest to me. And so the way I think about my niche on YouTube is I'm just like trying to live my own best life and then sort of teaching the things I've learned along the way to people who feel like watching it. So that's why I guess yeah, living your best life, but it sounds super cliche so I tend not to say it out loud. In terms of that journey into sort of discovering that your niche is not having a niche, have been any other YouTubers who you sort of look to for inspiration or seen their channels grow and taking ideas from? Yeah, so many over the years. Like I think the great thing about being a YouTuber is now watching watching YouTube becomes a productive activity. And so whenever I watch other YouTubers, I'm trying to steal ideas from them. There's this one chap called Simon Clark. who actually went to Oxford. He was like the OG Oxford University vlogger back in the day. He was probably the reason why I started the channel because he showed that you can be a nerd on YouTube and still do well. Because he had like 100,000 subscribers at the time and he was just like vlogging his PhD journey and talking about singing in the choir and how his physics formulas worked. And I was like, this guy, this guy's like me, but went to Oxford and was white. And so I thought, okay, if he can make it work, maybe I can make it work too. So Simon Clark was a big inspiration. And then there's this other chap called Peter McKinnon, who's this sort of photographer, videographer, tutorial guy. And he brought a real sense of energy and dynamism to the field of photography and videography tutorials. And so in my mind, I was always like, I want to be as cool as Peter McKinnon. And he has like tattoos and stuff, and I'm not that cool. But I think in my failure to imitate him, I sort of landed on my own kind of non-niche niche of just kind of sharing stuff on the internet that people seem to like. In terms of the videos themselves and the ideas behind them, What's the process of coming up with idea, putting it in pipeline, creating video, publishing it? How long does that take? What are the processes involved? And do many ideas get culled in the meantime? Yeah, so the process has really evolved over the years. I was actually planning out a video on the train on the way up here. Usually it comes from like just a little spark of an idea. So I read a quote in a book called the Almanac of Naval Ravikant, if anyone is a Naval fan, potentially, which said something like retirement is when you're not sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. I was like, ooh, that's deep. Retirement is when you're not sacrificing today for the sake of an imaginary tomorrow. I was like, okay, cool, that's kind of interesting. So it's like that sparked an idea in my mind of like, what does retirement actually mean and how is the definition of retirement changed over time? And so then I thought, okay, cool. This could be an interesting video called How to Retire Young, which sort of explores what does it mean to retire. I was thinking, okay, so one way of doing, one way of retiring is if the thing that you're doing right now is the thing that you would be doing if you didn't have to worry about money. So that's one definition of retirement. I'm just sort of living my best life and I'm not trying to do something for the sake of it, for the sake of making money. I think another definition of retirement is where you don't need to work because you've either made so much money that you don't need to work or your expenses are so low that your whatever investments or thing can can cover it. And so that led to sort of those, those are sort of three definitions of retirement and therefore I'm going to, maybe I can do a video talking about these three and how I'm applying them to my life. And then I just shoved the video into like a notion page and we're going to film it on Wednesday. So that's the process. The pipeline's that quick? Yeah, for a video where it's like I have an idea and I happen to be sitting on my iPad on the train where I'm like, I can just write it out. But other videos, like I remember I did one called How to Get Started with Investing, which sparked because I happened to be on a night shift. And one of my friends messaged me being like, hey, you're into this investing stuff. I want to get started. Like, how do I do it? And I started typing out a thing on WhatsApp and then thought there's really unproductive typing on your phone. So I just opened a notepad file on my shitty Windows computer at work and just started typing out a response to this friend and then realized, hang on, this could be a video. And I basically just wrote the whole video on that night shift because I didn't have anything going on. And then that became a video like a few months later when it came up in the pipeline. So that's how you manage ideas for videos. Is it a similar process of things like articles? and your book? Yeah, yeah, it's all the same stuff, really. I think really the thing that I think about is that sharing the idea is what's important and the medium doesn't really matter. Like whether it's a video or a TikTok or a article or a tweet thread or a newsletter or a podcast episode, like that's the distribution side of things. And so everything sort of just sparks from an idea. In terms of the way YouTube is often talk about platform and how the subscriber model works. It's not uncommon to hear YouTube and we've had several in the chamber talk about this with us. How there's a massive creative burnout problem because your channel sort of gets fixed on this idea that that's where your subscribers come from and you're constantly having to produce very similar content in a way that becomes very unsatisfying for the creator. And for the audience, very very repetitive and like just like the same stuff over and over again. Have you found that with your channel? Are you scared about it happening with your channel? Oh yeah. This is a thing that keeps me up at night all the time. It's like oh you know this the the channel was all fresh and stuff when I was a medical student and then it became fresh again when I was like a doctor and now I'm like a professional YouTuber making videos about how to be a YouTuber there's like some weird circularity that doesn't feel very satisfying I think the the solution to that is twofold number one it's to build a business around the thing that doesn't rely on hitting consistent view counts so a lot of the YouTubers I know who rely on sponsorship revenue for example really struggle when their views inevitably decline because it eventually declines. And now they're not making as much money and therefore they can't afford whatever things that they bought. But if you can build a business around it that kind of makes it makes its own products or it has it has diverse streams of revenue, it means you're not so reliant on sort of the fickle performance of an algorithm or kind of the changing interests of an audience. I think that's one side of it. And I think the other side of it, which is stuff I've been really thinking about in the last few months is really, and everyone says it, it sounds super cliche, but actually figuring out why you're doing the thing. Like what is the purpose behind it? Stephen Bartlett did a great interview with Simon Sinek, who famously wrote the book, Start with Why, where they talked about purpose. So I listened to that last week. And that really got me thinking around, if I wasn't doing this for the selfish motives of like money and fame and stuff, what would I actually want to be doing with my time? And the answer I landed on was I would continue making YouTube videos. I would just make them about whatever I want. And I would continue to read and write and learn cool stuff. and I would just make videos about it. And that's cool. And then I was thinking, wait a minute, why don't I just do that? Like, why am I so worried about, like, performance of algorithms and numbers and, like, oh, how did my latest video perform relative to the previous 10? When I could just make the things that I want because, like, yeah, we've got a business around it that works. So it's like, yeah, the thing that keeps me up at night. Do you think there are problems with the way YouTube works as a platform that accelerates that burnout for artists and creators? It probably does. Like, I think the thing, the issue is that, And it's like a good problem to have, right? Because if you think of YouTube as an art platform where people make stuff because they want to be creative, and then you tie revenue and metrics and like trend lines of how those metrics are increasing or decreasing over time to it, it's like you're combining money with art. And we know from history that when you combine money with art, that you end up with these weird incentives where an artist will start off doing a thing for the sake of the craft, the creativity of the art, and then you apply a money motive to it, and now that extrinsic motive crowds out the intrinsic reasons for doing the thing in the first place. And so the fact that on YouTube, those things are so tightly coupled and you just immediately know how did your latest video do, what were all the numbers just, and it just sort of blasts those numbers at your face. Unless you're very good at ignoring the number side of things, it's very easy to then chase the wrong thing. And it's all while I can go chasing an extrinsic target like money or subscribers or views or whatever. As long as that target's going up and as long as it's trending upwards, but as soon as it stops trending upwards, and if that's still the thing that you're chasing, then it starts to feel very like, oh my God, like life is a disaster, etc., etc. I was doing a bunch of reading into, you know, like in financial crises when you have, you know, deca billionaires who lose, who lose like 10 billion of their net worth. And some of them commit suicide. And you think, bro, you still got 30 billion left in the bank, like, come on, you're good. But, I think because the motivation of their entire life has been to make that number go up, suddenly when that number goes down, it causes a profound like, oh my God. And so I think that's kind of what's happening with creator burnout just at a much smaller scale, and hopefully there's not many people committing suicide over it. But I think the more we can decouple as creators decouple the money from the creativity, the better. And then that's also hard because if you're a full-time creator, you need to make money. So it's like, I think, I wouldn't criticize YouTube as a platform because that's literally how it works. Like, you make a video and you make money from the video. I think that tight coupling is what's causing some of the problems. Talking then about welfare and productivity, you've been described as a productivity guru in the way that you sort of have, you produce a lot of content on welfare and you've used a lot of content on study tubing and that sort of stuff. As I'm sure many Oxford students can attest to, often those two things can be diametrically opposed, as in welfare and productivity. Do you think that young people today, our generation, focus far too much work, focus far too much on work and productivity and extrinsic targets rather than on just living? Yeah, I don't think it's a new phenomenon. Like, I was recently reading Bertrand Russell's essay called In Praise of Idleness, which I think he wrote in like the 1930s or something. I might be off by plus or minus 10 years. But even then he was saying there is an epidemic of like work-workism and productivity and we all spend way too much time on our jobs thinking that our job and our work of simply moving matter at the earth surface or telling other people to do that. Like that's a definition of a job. He basically argues that it's done that we spend so much time at work and trying to drive economic output and not enough time actually enjoying life. Whereas what Aristotle decided back in the day that everyone's sort of agreed with is that once you've made your money, once you've got enough to subsist, at that point you should spend your time in leisure and contemplation. And so few of us genuinely spend our time in leisure and contemplation because we keep on chasing that next promotion, that next rung of the ladder. I have so many friends who did consulting and banking who are like, oh, but that promotion is only two years away. If I can just stick it out until that long. And I think similarly in medicine, like in medical school, there are a lot of medical students I speak to who are like, oh, you know, medical student is really hard. But three years from now, when I become a junior doctor, that's when I'm going to be really happy. And I think whenever we fall into this model of like, if dot, dot, dot, then I will be happy, that can all, like, obviously when you get there, you speak junior doctors. They're way less happy than medical students were, so it's like bad, bad place to be. So I think what it's it's so hard to, I think, disentangle those two things of like, I want productivity for the sake of success and economic output and I also want to live my best life. One solution to it, I don't have the answer, but one solution to it is genuinely just like work really hard for a few years, make your money and then you can chill a little bit. The And the problem with that is when you're so used to chasing extrinsic goals like grades and you all got sick grades, which is why you're here. And now you're at Oxford and you're like, oh shit, like my grades are no longer that good compared to everyone else around me. And you chase that 2-1 or that first, chase that spring week, intern shape, chase that next thing. It's genuinely hard to get off that treadmill of wanting more and more. Nothing is an easy answer to it, but I like reading essays about this kind of stuff. I think about it a lot in the sense of, you know, if I won the lottery, what would I be doing with my time? And if that thing is any different to what I'm currently doing, provided I'm kind of above the point where I've got my basic needs met, then what the hell am I doing with my life? Like, why am I chasing more money? Knowing that more money doesn't actually buy more happiness, as everyone says, and as all the research shows as well. I suppose that part of the appeal of the endless treadmill is that it at least provides life with some structure. And as you sort of pointed out in terms of the process of coming out with ideas and videos, the life of a creator or a creative more generally is often not very structured. How do you cope with that and ensure that you have some sort of vague format to your life? Yeah. So I'm all about structure. I just think that we, so the problem we're trying to solve is that it's hard to figure out how to spend your, I don't know, 116 hours each week if you started completely from scratch. But I think one way that we solve that problem is, okay, then I will just, I will, I will do what my employer tells me, because that solves the structure problem. But in fact, you can solve the structure problem by just deciding what you want to do with your life. One exercise I find genuinely really helpful is called the ideal ordinary week exercise, where you fast forward like three years in your Google calendar or whatever, and hopefully it's blank and you don't have all these recurring events. But then you just sort of block out what would you want your ideal ordinary week to look like? ideal because this would be like an ideal week, but ordinary in that it's not a week when you're on holiday. And so like how much time would you actually want to spend working? What would you want to be doing with that time? You know, for me, it's like, oh, you know, each day I'd like to do maybe three or four hours of reading and writing because that's fun. And then maybe like, you know, an hour or two of some kind of exercise or activity or hobby. And then maybe a couple of hours of hanging out with friends, maybe some time reading. Like, and you can basically structure your life in terms of what you would like in an ideal world. Then you just compare that with your current calendar and see, what's the difference between these two versions of the world? Obviously a lot harder to do at university where in a way you are working to for the sake of this university degree. But I think beyond that it's really useful to start thinking of that question. Like what would I actually be doing if I could design my life the way I wanted? And Cal Newport, who is this productivity guy, Stanford, I think, computer science professor, has a really good blog. I was reading some of his blog post from like 2010 where he says that the way to figure out, the advice he always gives to his students, terms of figuring out what career you want to do is don't start with I did a degree in economics therefore investment banking or private equity therefore dot dot because that really confines you to the kind of set of legible paths out there instead you want to think I've done my degree in economics whatever I don't care let's put that aside what is the lifestyle I would want do I want to be the sort of person that lives in a flat in New York and goes to Wall Street every day or whatever do I want to be like what does my ideal lifestyle look like and then find a career that matches that lifestyle because ultimately the point of a career is so that we can spend our time doing something that's meaningful and fulfilling, right? So why are we trying to reverse, why are we trying to get to meaningful and fulfilling from investment banking of private equity rather than starting with the broader blank slate of what does meaningful and fulfilling like to me, look like to me, and then finding a career that matches that. How did you sort of come up with that idea of career that matches that in the face of conflicting hobbies and passions and things that you enjoy. Yeah, so I think the thing with a career, right, is that, again, I have no original thoughts on this, but there's a good book called Your Money or Your Life by Vicky Robbins, which basically argues that the only point of a career, the only point of a job is to make money. And then people are like, oh, but like job gives me satisfaction, gives me friends, gives me social, gives me structure, gives me connection, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then to which she would say that, well, no, because you can get all those things when volunteering. You can volunteer for the Oxford Union. You can volunteer for your local church. And you will get connection and impact and socializing and structure and all those things. But if you add all those things and add money to it, now you have a job. And so really the point of a job is to make enough money to live. And if we don't put more of an expectation on our jobs that they also provide our life with meaning, profound meaning and joy, and we see a job for what it is, i.e. a thing that we do for an employer to make money. At that point, it becomes much easier to be like, okay, cool, this is the lifestyle I want, this is how much money I need for that lifestyle. Here are the possible career options that would take that money box, and then I can figure out what I want to do, what I want to enjoy, what I'm intrinsically motivated to do. And yes, in an absolutely ideal world, the thing you'd be doing for money is also the thing that you enjoy, but getting to that place takes a lot of work. Ali is right you can volunteer for the Oxford Union and appointed application are now open so so we'll shortly open up questions from the audience but I said I was to ask you what's next what have you got planned in the next few years except for book and do you want to elaborate on book yeah so I managed to stumble into like a book deal like last year and now I need to write a book and there's like an approaching deadline and so that's that's fun That's something that's taking up large amounts of time. In terms of what's next? I don't really know. I am currently trying to grapple with this question of, you know, to what extent, like, to what extent should I continue to chase extrinsic measures of success like money and follow account and stuff versus what is the service that I want to be giving to the world? That sounds very lofty, but like, you know, if we define happiness, says broadly, I am living a life that I enjoy, and meaning is defined as like, I'm living a life that's useful to other people. It's like, okay, cool, if I want to leave a happy and meaningful life, I want to live a life where I'm being useful to others in a way that I enjoy. And so far, my hypothesis for that is, if I could spend four hours a day reading and writing and teaching, that seems pretty good. So I'm just trying to figure out how I get to that point amidst the temptations of like, oh, but like you can make more videos and you can get more sponsorships and you could do more of this and more of that. Really trying to figure out like where it like when is enough enough. What is that point at which I have enough, I don't know, money in the bank or money and investments or followers or skills that I can then shift my, the way I spend my time to something that's a bit more meaningful than just chasing more clout. So I haven't figured it out, but like that's what I'm thinking about. As a YouTuber with very, very shortly 3 million subscribers, do you feel a sense of duty and obligation to your subscribers that changes how you think about those things? Nah. I think like a subscriber count is such a vanity metric. Like, subscribe account is completely irrelevant, broadly. Because like someone who subscribed to my channel way back in 2017 because I was helping them get into med school. Whether or not they got into med school, like chances are maybe, probably that same person is not then watching my same. stuff five years later. And so like the subscriber count keeps going up because people tend not to unsubscribe from a channel unless you get cancelled and they're kind of making a point. But then of just become becoming quote like inactive subscribers like they don't even watch watch the videos. And this used to kind of bother me that like oh but my view to sub ratio is not it's not good and I used to use it as a point of comparison with other people that are oh but like Stephen Bartlett has a really good view to subscriber ratio. Fuck like what do I do? And then I kind of realized that, you know, if I think of the people, the teachers whose work has most changed my life, you know, I'd say Tim Ferriss is fairly high on the list. The chap called Derek Sivers. With Tim Ferriss, I've maybe consumed 1% of his content. But that was the 1% I needed to really change the trajectory of my life and start my business and built passive income and all that fun stuff. And if I ever met Tim Ferriss, I'd probably like break down in tears as to how much he's changed my life and just be an absolute mess. But I watched like 1% of his staff. I don't even listen to the vast majority of his podcast episodes. And so I don't really feel a kind of duty to subscribers in that sense. I just kind of think of it as I'm just going to run my own race. I'm just going to try and put stuff out into the world that I think is useful. And as long as it's useful to at least one person, then that's what matters. And yeah, if the numbers trend down over time, then we'll probably be like, all right, cool, we've got another 10 years of runway. Let's just make sure we kind of have 20 years of runway. But beyond that, I think the model of, like I find myself, a lot happier and making a lot better content when I think I just need this to be useful to at least one person in the world than when I think that I have a duty to this mass, amorphous mass of 3 million people. Do you think you will be YouTubeing in 10 years time professionally? I think so. I think so. Like again, it's it's it's it's kind of hard to imagine. Like I can't imagine being 50 years old and being like, hey guys, welcome back to the channel or whatever. That that feels weird. But also like, again, it's just a it's just a form of distribution. I think the thing I'll always want to do is learn stuff and share ideas. And whether that looks like I'm a 58-year-old on TikTok or YouTube or whatever AR VR program comes out at the time or maybe writing books, I'm fairly agnostic on that front. So who knows? Maybe YouTube, maybe not. We'll see. Before I open up to questions from the audience, what advice do you have, except for all the content on your YouTube channel, to any of our members who want to take their creative juices to the internet? That's such a horrible phrase. Oh, creative juices. I mean, yeah, there's sort of like three levels of it. Like get going, get good, and then get smart. Get going is actually just do the thing. Like there's so many people like, I probably know about 10 times as many people who want to start a YouTube channel as who actually start a YouTube channel. And the thing that always holds them back is just like, oh, like, oh, but like camera's not good enough, like I don't know what to make videos about, I haven't figured out my niche. But that's sort of like, I don't know, a writer saying I'm not, I'm never going to write a single word, I'm not even going to start writing until I figured out what my best-selling book is going to be about. Or an artist that's like, you know what, I'm not even going to learn how to paint until I figure out, figure out what my masterpiece is going to be that's hanging up here in the Oxford Union. That would just be weird, whereas YouTube is like, oh, I'm not even going to start making videos until I know what to make videos about. And if you can kind of short circuit that like loop of procrastination, then that's really good. So just like put stuff out there and it's going to be crap initially, but that's fine. And then level two is get good. That's when you actually try and get good at the craft by just doing it lots and lots of times and improving the feedback Same as anything else if you're trying to get good at writing trying to get good at painting Trying to go to go to writing essays you just have to do a lot of it and and get feedback and improve as you go along And then level three is getting smart where you then think about okay do I want to make this a business is it a hobby? What's my niche? Target audience competitor analysis all of the stuff that businesses then do and I think the problem is that people approach People are people who are at level zero are worrying about things at level three. They're worrying about their niche. They're very their target audience and stuff when they haven't even gotten started and they don't know how to speak to a camera. So if there's one thing I would say, it would be like, just do the thing, no one's going to care, no one's going to watch it, friends won't care, don't worry about it, it's all good. And once you can get over that initial hurdle of just like putting yourself out there, at that point it becomes way easier to continue. Perfect, thank you very much. I'm sure you will have burning questions to ask. So if I'll open up to the audience, please put your hand on membership card in the air and then if I choose you wait until one of our fantastic committee members, volunteers of the Oxford Union come bring you a microphone please stand up and ask your question so without further ado any member who wishes to ask a question to dr. Abdal please please says your the member in the mint t-shirt it's great how you're plugging this volunteering thing by this is great hello Sam Kramer also under the YouTube channel Sam's Oxford Studies I was very interested about what you talked about duty to do to subscribe to duty to subscribers because even if we don't think of subscribers in that way I was interested in the duty parts because obviously you have a big audience and you can influence people I also think in this specific niche people can get quite interested in it and almost culty and I think you can maybe have a bigger influence on the people you speak to than people in gaming industries for example so I was wondering when you make your own life decisions to be happy and healthy and all this kind of stuff if you have to take a step back sometimes and think about what's best for your audience so for example, in effective altruist terms, when you're quitting medicine, although that might be the right thing for you and you talk about, you're just one cog in a big system, if you were to reduce the amount of doctors applying to UK medical schools by 0.5%. That could make a really big thing. So I'm just very interested to hear how much you judge that compared to your own stuff individually. Oh, that's a really good question. So I did think about this a lot before kind of being public about my decision to leave medicine. Ultimately, I decided that like the thing that I care about and like the impact that I want to have is to come back to this cliche to help other people live their best life. And I think if everyone, if everyone that I could influence lived a life that was kind of authentic to them but also useful to other people, we'd end up ticking a lot of boxes of like impact in terms of the effective altruism components. So if, for example, you know, I met some guy in Dubai the other day who was like, I watched your video and it inspired me to drop out of med school. And I was like, oh, crap, okay. And he was like, and I realized that like actually making inspiring videos on Facebook in Arabic was my jam. And now I've got like, freaking eight millions of followers on Facebook in Arabic. And I help people, I help students study for their exams. It's like, damn, that's pretty cool. It's like, this guy was not living his authentic life, he's living his best life by being in med school. But he found this thing that was his calling that provided an impact in some way. a different sort of impact to being a doctor, but, you know, an impact nonetheless. And so the way I think of it is if I can just sort of, in a way, raise the aspirations is the wrong word, but just like encourage people to do the thing that they want to do, and also encourage people that like, guys, the way to a meaningful life is to be useful to other people. That combination of I'm doing what I love and I'm useful to other people at scale, I think, I hope, is more net positive than people staying in medicine if they don't necessarily want to be there. So if, for example, you were to not enjoy the videos anymore, would you still maybe feel a pressure to because you feel you have to be net useful to the hundreds of thousands of people that watch you, even if it's really making upset? Probably not. So my housemate, Lucia, is big on effective altruism. She dropped out of, well, she quit medicine after two years to start a charity that's helping like reduce lead poisoning in the developing world. It's amazing, amazing stuff. And her drive is very much impact first. She would do something that makes herself unhappy for the sake of impact. impacting people, I wouldn't. I'm a lot more selfish. And so for me it's like, I need to be enjoying the thing that I'm doing and then also hope that it has an impact. But if I wasn't enjoying it, I'd find another way to have an impact. Any of the members have a question they'd like to ask? Oh, they have to hold up their membership cards. Yeah, well, they should do, but we're lenient, we're lenient. Very draconian. It's much more chill at Cambridge. Hey, so as a philosophy student, one of my favorite videos naturally is your video on stoicism and I really, really enjoyed it. However, you haven't really followed up on it. It was like just a video I think you did like one or two years ago. Is that still a philosophy of life you like adhere to and like how much does it really like affected your life? No, no question. Stoicism. Yeah, I'm big on the stoicism thing. I just kind of stopped making videos about it because I thought everyone knew about it. But like clearly, clearly not. No, it's still, it's still very much a part of a part of my life. I'm all about premeditating and keeping your expectations low, you know, dichotomy of control, being able to choose your response from a certain stimulus. I guess, actually if I think about it, one area in which I'm personally working on is trying to be more like emotionally intelligent and like emotionally supportive and stuff. And I think that in a way the Stoicism Cool Aid has sort of combined with my already non-emotional personality to drive me too far into the extreme of like feelings don't matter. I can choose my response in any situation. If I'm feeling any kind of negative emotion, then that's bad and I can change the story I tell myself. I think that stuff has its place, but I think there is also, also I've heard some level of the human experience that gets unlocked when you actually take a feeling seriously. And so that's more the side that I'm trying to explore now, but I haven't yet made any videos about it. Next question please. Veney. Hi, I'm Vinay. I used to be a dentist. I'm studying public policy. So I love your hair, by the way. Thank you so much. Very stylish. Thank you. I love yours too. That's great. Okay, guys. I, so I think you went to did med school as far some of my friends were the same age and I want to congratulate you on all your success. I wanted to ask about your hiring practices and developing a team because I know you're right. at a stage, I did a similar thing where helping people getting to dental school, I think every British Asian does this at one point in this view. Yeah. Anyone who is brown will start a course business. Exactly. Exactly. And it's great. And it's fantastic. White people never do it. I've never met a single white person who has a course of business. It's very interesting. So yeah, the same thing. But I wanted to know about hiring and your kind of practices and how that moves forward. Yeah, hiring is really hard. At some point when you guys have jobs and stuff become managers, you're going to get the advice that hiring is really hard, and you're not going to believe it until you actually start hiring people, and then you realize, oh shit, hiring is really hard. I have no philosophies on this. I read a book, Who, the A method for hiring, it was very good. We try and use that for our people. I think it's like, hiring is hard, firing people is hard. If someone's doing like okay, but they're not doing amazingly, you're like, oh, they're doing okay, but like, I don't know if it's that good. And you're worried about like firing them because they're like, have I given them the feedback? Have I given them the appropriate onboarding experience? And you have all this other stuff that goes into it. I have no real philosophy on this. Other than, I think, at least for the people that I hire, I find that hiring someone who is young and dedicated, basically, who genuinely wants to be there, even if they don't have the skills, like they can learn the skills. And so there's that phrase like hire for attitude and train for skills, which I have found to be useful. It's not the way Netflix do it. Their whole thing is like, if you're not an A-team player, If you're not a star player, we're just going to get rid of you because we want a team of star players. And that works for them. I think it's like so hard to find a compelling philosophy that works in all in 100% of cases. But generally, hiring for attitude and training for skills has been my approach. And how do you know who to hire and how do you how do you know what to outsource? Because I was watching some of your videos on like outsourcing things that you don't want to do. Like even cooking or cleaning and what's your kind of philosophy on that? Oh, yeah. My whole thing is that like, unless I'm really good at it and I love doing it, then I shouldn't do it. So, you know, right now I'm in the process of trying to find a another, a third personal assistant. Because the last two who I hired have ended up just doing other things in the business and like doing other stuff. So now I need another personal assistant for all the random shit in my life that I'm just not doing because I can't be bothered to do it. And that's like a nice place to be where you can actually delegate stuff to people. Most people are not in that position just yet, but when you get to that position, it's like fun. But my other thing is like, you know, like time is our most valuable non-renewable resource. I don't want to spend my time doing stuff I don't like unless I deem it to be valuable in some way. I don't think cleaning and laundry and stuff is particularly valuable. So, yeah, I think every everything else should be outsourced. Next question, please. I'll remember in the total night. Just a quick one. Can we expect any more episodes of not overthinking? Yeah, yes. We're going to start from next week. That's the plan. We have it in the calendar. Yeah. Member from Malamitch. Hello. I'm just wondering, you post lots of inspirational and motivational, like quotes and ideas on social media. How many of them do you genuinely believe and live by and how many of them are just posted for the sake of being an online presence and having content regularly uploaded? Gilly uploaded. Oh, that's such a good question. It depends on the month because, so like, you know, now that we have like a whole, like a social media manager and a team and stuff, and they're like, oh, Jay Chetty and Steve Bartlett post these like motivational quotes, you should do the same. And I don't see the Slack message when they send me that because I don't really keep on top of Slack messages. And then they start doing it. And then I'd get messages from friends being like, what the fuck is that on your Twitter? And I'm like, oh God, I can't believe this and then I send them feedback being like guys this is a vapid motivational quote that means nothing can we delete it please and then they delete it right now we're at an in a at a place where I have decided I have basically said that where we are not trying to grow a motivational quotes account for the sake of it just because that's what Jay Shetty and Stephen Bartlett are doing we need to make sure that I genuinely believe the shit that we post so for now we genuinely I genuinely believe the stuff that I post hopefully that will continue hopefully fingers crossed I have sort of two full-up questions oh yes please that Firstly, we want to do with the changing nature of online spaces and TikToks now are more consumed than YouTube. How does that change your outlook to things like social media and doing things like motivational quotations or your music videos on Instagram or just content on TikTok? Yeah, I keep on thinking I should probably take TikTok more seriously. We do have a big filming day like on Wednesday where we're filming like 20 TikToks in one day just to see what happens. A bit of an experiment but like we'll see. And I think I'm not particularly wedded to any individual social platforms because it's just a form of distribution. And distribution changes over the years, whether it's like Tony Robbins, educational, motivational CDs or DVDs or cassette tapes, or whether it's radio, whether it's TV, whether it's TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube. It's all just forms of distribution. And so for me, that's not the thing I care about. The thing I care about is the core idea that I find useful and that might help someone else. The other issue with the whole like motivational quote thing is that, A lot of times, motivational quotes are like really good. Like, you know, they're, but they sound really cliche because when you, if you, if you take something complicated, like I don't know, Plato's Republic or something, I don't know what I'm using that as an example, I've never read Plato's Republic. But like, I imagine if you were to take Plato's Republic and summarize and summarize and summarize, at the fifth kind of derivative of summarization, you would end up with, uh, follow your passion because that's what living a good life is. And you're like, well, what the hell is the point of that motivational quote? But it's actually a distillation of like this large body of work which summarizes to follow your passions. And I think, this is another quote from someone called like the secrets to life are hidden behind the word cliche. And whenever we say something is cliche, it's cliche for a reason. It's because it's such common wisdom, but it needs to be continually, we need to continue to remind ourselves of it because it's very easy to then lose the side of that. And so I think the trick is to stop at like one level below to too simple to the point that it feels cliche, but still sufficiently legit that it feels like, yeah, fortune cookie tweet kind of vibes. The other sort of full-up question I had was regarding the fact that the internet has led to an explosion in what I suppose people could call pop philosophers or pop counsellors, ranging all the way from people like Jordan Peterson and yourself to small content creators. Why do you think that the internet has had this impact? And do you think it's overall a good thing? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I think it's great. I think the great thing about the internet is that it has made, it's like the long tail effect. Like back in the day, it was like a handful of major distributors who were like doing the stuff. And if you wanted your stuff to get out there, you would have to either get a publishing deal from like Penguin or you would have to get it on one of the five TV stations. And that meant that as an individual, you don't really have access to the thoughts of other individuals, you have access to the thoughts of these massive corporations. Thanks to the internet, anyone can share their thoughts online, anyone can become a Twitter think boy, anyone can start a newsletter, kind of espousing, like spouting Plato's thoughts or Aristotle's thoughts, and bastardizing them to apply them for the 21st century or whatever. And that's good, because it means that now there are stuff out there for everyone. Like if, I don't know, Jordan Peterson doesn't particularly vibe with me, I can follow Michaela Peterson's podcast, if I really want to. If that doesn't particularly, vibe with me. There is some dude on Twitter who's got like 50 followers who tweets really interesting stuff. And I'm like, oh my God, this guy has the perfect combination of interest. He's into knitting. He's into like flower arranging and he's into reading philosophy. This is my jam. And so there is really something out there for everyone. And I think that's why you have this explosion of like pop philosophers, pop psychologists, life gurus. Because I think what, like, this stuff only works because people, people vibe with it. Like loads of people are anti Jordan Peterson. But the fact that his stuff is genuinely useful to a large amount of people in the world means that it's going to survive. And if it wasn't useful, it wouldn't survive. So anyone can kind of succeed on the internet as a pop philosopher or a pop psychologist. I think that's broadly a good thing, providing they're not spreading misinformation and stuff around public health issues. But, you know, most people aren't. So that's not something I'm overly concerned about. Back to you guys. They're the creative member of the back. Hello, I just wanted to ask because you often encourage people to start the usual channel and just get going straight away. And how did you first deal with negative comments or any comments that were like not very kind or helpful to your growth? Yeah, it's pretty rare to get. Like I don't think I had like a single negative comment for many months into my YouTube journey when I had like 40 plus videos. And then I got one which I think I think. was making fun of the size of my nose or something like that. And I was like, okay, yeah, fair enough. Fair play, you know, this is something I've thought I've thought many times myself. I just kind of moved on. Over time, that has kind of piled up. And I know a bunch of YouTubers, or like newish YouTubers who have maybe a few thousand, a few tens of thousands of subscribers, who are very concerned about like, oh, you know, when I post a video, yes, I get 100 really nice comments, but I'll get one comment saying, you know, my skin looks bad or just I was wrong or something negative. And I think it's really about everyone going on their own personal journey or figuring out how much do you want to let the kind of the comments of a vocal minority of people like override the fact that you're doing something that you hopefully enjoy that's impacting people, that's making a difference. And yeah, there's no easy way around this. To be honest, like this is a good, probably shouldn't say good. There's There is a forum called Tatel, which is like this celebrity gossip type forum, where like, I think last year I stumbled upon a thread that was about me. It was like seven pages long of people just piling in and like saying mean things about me. And I made the mistake of reading it. And then I was like, oh, stoicism, stoicism. Like, this is all good. And I realized actually, in a conversation with my brother on our podcast, that actually, this really affected me, seeing all these people out there who were just like completely character assassinating me from every little interaction and every little video. oh the way he looked at that girl in that video collab that he did shows that he's a misogynist or you know random shit like that and I was then sort of reading this thing like every day for a few weeks and I realized why the hell am I reading this now this thread is over 50 pages long and I haven't looked at it in the last I haven't looked at it since it was seven pages long so I think a big part of it is that if I see negative stuff or if I know it exists I just don't read it because it doesn't it doesn't really it's it's not going to be good for my mental health to see that stuff out there But I think also another part of it is, you know, I think, okay, even if I did see this stuff, would it stop me from putting my stuff out there into the world where maybe it'll be useful to some people? And even if my stuff is useful to one person, but 20 people don't like it, I'd still like to be the sort of person that posts it anyway because it's useful to that one person, even though 20 other people don't like it. But it's not easy. It's a personal journey everyone has to go on. Can I ask one more question? Sure. Okay. You mentioned that you do help a lot of people. And like often, students will say that they find a lot of study hacks and skills and ways of learning that they haven't been introduced to in school. Is there a reason that you think that that's the case? Yeah, I only really learned that study techniques were a thing in like my second year of uni when we happened to have a psychology lecture about it. I was like damn, why is no one told us this before? I think more schools are now putting it on like occasionally I'll get like Instagram story mentions from someone in a school in like some random country who's like teacher is showing them one of my videos. like, oh, here's how you study for your exams, apply these principles. So I think that's nice that people are learning this stuff. I don't know. It's like how in school you don't learn what like a mortgage is or basic financial literacy or like meta learning skills. Yeah, I just wish it were different because I feel like if I had discovered these techniques earlier on in my life, I would have saved loads of time and been able to spend twice as much time playing Water Warcraft as I did. So yeah. member in the front row. Thank you, Sue. When you're starting like a new venture or something that's like building off of your your brand as a YouTube channel or a content creator, how do you decide like whether it's worth pursuing like past like just the beginning of it? How do you know if it's something that you want to do over the long term and how do you evaluate it? Ooh, good question. How do we evaluate new ventures? Um, three things. Does it help people? Is it fun and does it make enough money? Does it help people, you know, the box is often ticked because it's like most of the stuff we do helps people. Does it feel like is the thing fun is something I only really realize once we're doing it? And if it's fun, we continue and if it's not fun, we don't continue. And is it making enough money now increasingly has become more of a consideration? Because even though we have a team of 20 people in the business, we're still trying to do too much stuff and there's always more things we could be doing. And one of the nice things, but also one of the bad things about having success in any area of life, is that suddenly you start getting loads and loads of inbound and really cool opportunities. And now you have to really say no to 99% of them and say yes to only 1% of them. And so if it's a pure, pure business decision these days we're like, I don't know, I have probably some number in my mind of if this thing makes more than X amount per month, then I think it's a good thing to do. I'm also kind of juggling up like, okay, how many team members does it take? Therefore, what's the cost of those team members per year? Okay, is this thing ROI positive? There's all these sort of business considerations that go into it. But to be honest, the thing's not fun. Even if it's making loads of money, we're not going to do it because at this point, we have the luxury of being able to do only things that are fun and that help people. I'll have one more question, I think, if the member over there. Oh, remember over there. Hello. Hi, I think that it's pretty fair to say that you value kind of the journey of self-improvement. I was wondering at what point you think that that journey of kind of accumulation, if not wealth, happiness, what point does kind of philanthropy come into that and when does it start to eclipse the resources that you'll put into that kind of journey of self-improvement? Where do you think charity and philanthropy kind of comes in? And is that something that we can continue to see from you? Really good question. So right now I don't think about it too hard. I have taken the Giving What We Can pledge, which is this thing in Effective Altruism, where you pledge to donate 10% of your income every year to effective charities. And so every year I do that thing. The nice thing about the giving what we can pledge is that kind of the point of it is that you can then just do the thing and then you don't have to think about it too hard. It means that I know that, okay, every year 10% of my income is going to an effective charity, cool. Now I don't need to kind of beat myself up for not, I don't know, spending more time in philanthropy or giving to charity or things like that. So that's where I'm at right now. In terms of the future, so I've read a few people's thoughts about this. There's this like CEO coach in Silicon Valley called Matt Mokery, who's written a great book called The Great CEO Within, I 100% recommend if you're interested in to startups and stuff. What he says is that basically every startup founder, when they're young, they're trying to make loads of money, cool. Then they make loads of money and then they're like, cool, and I want to have fun, and then they have fun. And once they've made their money and had their fun, at that point they realize actually helping people is the way forward and they switch to philanthropy. And his model is that actually that is a good thing. It is a good thing that people are switching to shifting their efforts to philanthropy once they've made their money and had their fun because usually that's meant they've built a business or a platform that allows them to have even more of an impact when they do the philanthropy stuff. Whereas if you do the philanthropy stuff too early, it's like if I'd spent 50% of my time to use a crass example, volunteering at a soup kitchen or something like that for the sake of charity or giving back, that's time that wouldn't have been spent building a platform, building the business. And so that's like one theory about this. I suspect that, yeah, for me over time, the philanthropy, the charity, the giving back, will hopefully eclipse the I want to make more money, I want to become happier, I want to have more fun. Right now it hasn't. And so I trust the giving what we can pledge as being like my kind of good deed out there. But I suspect that will probably change over time. One last question for me before we said they have to end, which is a question we ask all of our speakers when they come to the union, which is in a couple of sentences, if you had the audience of the entire Oxford Union and all of the University of Oxford, what advice would you give them going forwards in their lives. Hmm. Hmm. I would say figure out why you're really doing what you're doing. Is it making you happy? Is it helping other people? Is it making them happy? Are you making enough money from that? And isn't that enough? And I think like kind of recognizing the point of enough is, hugely valuable and a thing that I think about almost daily these days, I kind of wish I'd thought about it more when I was younger. And I have to credit a chap called Derek Sivers for that quote because like, I remember it was way back in 2016, that was when my first business, which was helping people get into med school was, you know, I'd been running it for five years at that point. And I was running into this dilemma of like, this thing is not particularly fun anymore, but it's making money. So what do I do? Like, do I want to do the, the thing? that's making money even though it's not fun. And I came across that quote of like, never forget why you're doing what you're doing. Are you happy? Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you profitable? Isn't that enough? And it really helped me realize that yeah, actually, it is enough. I don't need to try, I don't need to try and make more money from this thing. And then six years later, like I was doing a journaling session in Cambridge the other day. I just happened to have a few hours to myself. I ended up kind of really figuring out, like, kind of how I feel about the business and the YouTube channel and like thinking, huh, what's the point of all this kind of stuff? And I just, I remembered that same question. quote again and that same quote again like really helped me realize that finding that point of enough is really important and as long as you're as long as what you're doing is making you happy and helping people then that's like a pretty good way good way of living life so yeah say that's a good piece of advice that's helped me at least twice in the last six years and so that's the thing that I would say to people at Oxford ladies gentlemen please join me and thanking Dr. Alley Abdel. Thank you.
