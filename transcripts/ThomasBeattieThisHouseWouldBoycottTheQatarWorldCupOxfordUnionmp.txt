 So I actually haven't prepared a speech, but I want to talk about this topic in this narrative because it's very personal to myself. So I'm going to go from the heart. So some of you may know and some of you may not, but in 2020 I came out as the first openly gay footballer in the last 32 years from the UK. So this is something I'm very passionate about. I previously cleared for Hull City in England and then went on to playing Canada, the US and I actually finished playing in Singapore, where I was brought on foreign talent to become a Singaporean. And now I look back and I considered why I ended up playing in so many obscure, strange places of the world. And I realized because I was running, from myself. I was running from my identity. And it took me a long time to become comfortable with who I was. And I know around the age of 15, 16, I really, really struggled. And I looked around and I saw nobody. I was so alone. And so I couldn't resonate with my teammates, but I couldn't resonate with anything I saw in the media or on television. And I think having people in football would have been very beneficial for me to to really understand myself. So when I was asked to come here, I had to consider two things mainly. I really understand the power of sport as a vehicle for change. And some of the things you mentioned, obviously, I feel very strongly about. I understand we can use football to change hearts and minds. Music and sport will always be two things which bring people together. But what I feel more passionately about, is the fact that my community is oppressed in an area of the world where I know first-hand what goes on. I hear the messages. I receive them on a daily basis and some of which they're quite aggressive towards me because of my privilege. I know as a white privileged male I have the protection of the government and so I'm in a lot better position to speak on the narrative. I get people saying to me if I made the decision you made I would be put in a concentration camp I would be going I would be put in a position to go through conversion therapy I would be taken away from my family there is currently one openly gay individual in Qatar individual not football player just one openly gay human he is in the US Dr Nas Muhammad and he's an asylum seeker in the US and he had to flee his country to find safety who is obviously he's now a big advocate but I spoke to him last week because I actually have a lot of engagement with FIFA and so I don't want to be a political pawn whether it benefits me if he doesn't benefit my community then I don't want any part of that and I spoke to him last week because I wanted to get an understanding of what really is going on in Qatar having only been there very briefly and he said to me many of his friends just live in fear and although I lived in fear, I lived in fear of what people thought of me. I lived in fear of what my teammates thought of me supporters, friends family but I never really feared for my life and I think this is the real difference when I was asked to come here and consider the two narratives. Yes, I feel strongly about football as a vehicle for change, but I feel more strongly about protecting my community, knowing what is going on. When we talk about the World Cup bringing about change, I often consider why now in Qatar. Why are we saying we can use football as a narrative to change? Why can we not do that anyway? Why do we need to give the privilege of a global sporting event to a country which doesn't have basic human rights across the board? And then we turn around with that and say, we can use this as a vehicle for change. I know first time there is no structure for change. The World Cup was given to Qatar 12 years ago for the first time ever in the Middle East. and I'm pretty sure it will be a very long time again afterwards. So I know firsthand from the inside there is no structure to create safe guidelines for LGBT people who are in Qatar. I think there is a narrative to help supporters go into Qatar and make sure we create this bubble. But when we talk about sport being a vehicle for change, we want it to be a real change, not just to change for a temporary period of time. You know, we want the locals in Qatar to feel free, to feel safe and to feel protected. After these games, when everybody leaves, you know, the hope would be that the change has some longevity. So although I, again, understand the power of sport being a vehicle for change, I don't believe that this global sporting event, which is such a privilege, is there to do that. I think there are other reasons why we are in Qatar. Therefore, you know, based on my lived experience, based on the fact that I know there are many other oppressions that go on in Qatar and other areas of the world. I'm not saying it's the only country, but we've awarded these global sporting events to countries like China in the Olympics and Qatar for the World Cup. And I feel very strongly about the fact that we should have basic human rights across the board. if you're ever going to apply to host a global sporting event. So, again, this is something that I didn't write. It isn't scripted. It's something I feel very passionately about. I've experienced it myself, and I know what people are going through in Qatar. Therefore, in my opinion, going forward, and even for these games, if you ask me what can we do, like Lucas mentioned, you know, you don't have to watch the games. if you still want to watch the games, you can stream them. But my ask would be for anybody who feels compelled to do so, is to really try and comprehend the struggle of what it's like to live alive. Like I lived and that many other people in Qatar live on a daily basis who fear for their lives. You know, we don't want to be rewarding regimes which oppress any minority. That goes for the LGBT community for different races, religions, ethnicities, we want to use these games to promote equality and diversity. After all, the games is a celebration of the fact that we are all different, but we're in fact all the same. So I feel like it's kind of hypocritical and contradictory to use these games as a way to celebrate this amazing period of life that we go through every four years, but exclude a member of our society or community. So again, it's something I feel very passionately about I'm trying to speak from the heart because it's something I had many sleepless nights over for a long period of time, and I'm sure there are many other people in Qatar doing the same right now, praying for the opportunity and the privileges that I have now. So if I have to hide behind football to spread that message, I don't want to do that. So I would ask everybody in here to find it in your heart if you're not in the community, if you don't know anyone in the community, to think what it would be like if your younger brother, their younger sister, a family member, a very close friend, felt oppressed about something they was born with, they couldn't change. And our country had been asked to celebrate the rest of society apart from them. Thank you. Thank you.
