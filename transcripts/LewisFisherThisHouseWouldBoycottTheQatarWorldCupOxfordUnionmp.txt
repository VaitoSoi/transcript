 When this World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010, the issues in the country were well known. Five years later, in 2015, it was announced that the World Cup would be taken place in November to accommodate the extreme heat. The attention was back on. These periods, and the years directly after, were the crucial periods to try and organize a boycott. consensus could have been gained amongst a number of countries and it would have been much more much better organised given that the news coverage was on there would have been ample time to arrange for a second host but instead memorands were made and nothing was done to do it now mere weeks before the tournament kicks off which I must remind you is what the proposition are advocating for tonight despite Lucas's mentioning of watching it in one room and after north of $200 billion is being spent on organising it is foolish and takes away from the image of football as a whole for the story immediately goes from one of dissatisfaction with Qatar to one of football's governing body being a disorder in chaos rather than the great unifier we know football can be given that the spotlight is well and truly on Qatar to boycott now would be to definitively pull the plug on the chance of change. To borrow from Harold Wilson, the winds of change are blowing. The Qatari government so far has been obliged to cede ground on a number of issues. On workers' rights, an Amnesty International report released just this afternoon, recognises that Qatar has introduced several labour reforms, which have led to some noticeable improvements for the country's two million migrant workers. While enforcement of these laws must obviously be a top priority. It is promising to see them introduced and some progress made compared to 2010. And yet a boycott would be to stop this progress in its tracks. For what incentive would Qatar or FIFA have to recompense those workers who have come to harm or the families of those who have died and are now left without a major breadwinner? If a boycott were to happen, the proposition failed to answer this and I can tell you that now because no answer exists. They would have lost an enormous sum of money and being disgraced on the international stage. At this feebrile time in world politics, there is no doubt that Qatar would turn inwards. There are much better solutions on the table. For example, amnesty has proposed the compensation fund of $440 million, equivalent to the prize money on offer at the World Cup. But given that $200 billion is being spent, why stop there? Why not go for more? turning now to the LGBT community issues a report in the summer from a respected London consultancy Cornerstone Associates noted that some in the Qatari leadership wanted to suspend the anti-LGB law just during the world cut but there was some of an hour and about it and they had been stopped by more hardline conservatives yet just last month the FAA was able to announce they had been briefed on the very same issues by the Qatari government the police had been told to be tolerant, holding hands and kissing the public would not leave any fans facing arrest. Rainbow flags were to be allowed just as long as they were in a respectful manner. For example, they wouldn't be draped on the outside of a mosque. Said the chief of the F.A. They have absolutely told us all the right answers. But don't just take it from me, or the chief of the F.A. Take it from the next speaker you hear tonight, Mr. Thomas Beattie. In a recent interview, he said, and I quote, They're having conversations in Qatar now which they wouldn't be having otherwise. As a country, they're now having to ask what are we going to do for LGBT fans to keep them safe? To boycott now would be to take all the window to the sales of those moderates in the governments I mentioned earlier, proven to the hardliners that their values would never be compatible with the ideals we ourselves hold there. It's also vitally important in any case that the Qatari governments has agency in any change that has made and is seen to do so. To that end, we must do as son, Zusserl and build the opponents of Golden Bridge across which to retreat. We must appreciate the spectacle of the tournament with those who sacrificed so much for it held foremost in our mind, both now and in the future when we achieve this change, rather than forget us about them in a few weeks when the next PM decides to resign. I want to leave you tonight then with this thought. is it worth patting ourselves on the back for moral righteousness while neglecting the chance for real change or is it better to use this opportunity to ensure that the change does happen so that the workers are sufficiently recompense for their sacrifice and not made the face of a campaign that leaves them with nothing so that the laws which the Qataris have guaranteed leniency on remain so permanently for both women and LGBTQ community so that FIFA is never again in the position where the actions of the ordinary fans have to save football, the beautiful game from the poor decisions of the governing body. Let us not seek the mere absence of tension, but rather the fulfilment of real justice. And let us do that while enjoying football's greatest spectacle. And who knows, maybe, just maybe, football will come home. Thank you.
