 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to tonight's huge, huge event. Tonight will be joined by Billy Jean King, former number one world tennis player and also an activist for equal pay and women's rights. Billy Jean King is one of the most successful tennis players of all time, winning 39. major titles and was part of the victorious US team in seven Federation Cups and nine white men cups. King won the legendary Battle of the Sexes match against Bobby Riggs during her fight for the equal recognition of women's tennis. After King protested the gender pay gap, the US Open became the first major tournament to offer equal prize money. It gives me great pleasure and honor to welcome Billie Jean King in our chamber tonight. Thank you very much. Billy Jean. May I call you Billy or Billy? Billy? Just not Beijing. Billy Jean. Can I call you Ahmad? Yeah. All right. Well, firstly, thank you very much for joining us. We've been trying for a while as a union to host you here. Yes, about three years finally. This has worked out. So many people have been messaging me that we're excited in waiting for, like can't wait for Belize and King. And honestly, I didn't watch much tennis before. But in the recent sort of weeks, I've been learning more about it. And it's been very inspiring to learn about your journey and your career through throughout your life. So I wanted to start the conversation by sort of firstly when I was sort of doing my research, you brought up in a very athletic household. So your mother, I believe, was a swimmer. Your father played basketball and baseball. And your younger brother became a major league baseball pitcher. Apparently even the church that you attended, the minister was also an athlete. Yeah, he was Olympic champion in Polvald. He won two goals in like, I think what, 52 and 56? Yeah. So, Reverend Bob Richards is his name. Oh, okay. Yeah. So was that something that influenced to you slash, did you feel a certain sort of pressure that, you know, into going into sports or? No, no pressure. That's why it all worked out for my brother and me. My parents never asked us if we won. Yeah. There's no pressure. You know how many parents go, did you win? Did you win? No, they didn't care about that. They'd say, how was your day? And then, of course, if we had lost, oh, my God. I mean, we're very motivated, very intense. So it got real crazy. I go, of course, I mean, I lost. I can't believe it. I'm going on and on. And my dad just goes, calm down, calm down. He asked me one question, did you try your best? I said, well, of course I tried my best. And he goes, that's good enough. Yeah, because I believe, I mean, since they were also all athletes and sports people in some ways, perhaps they understood that it's a lot more about the fact that you're young and you're trying your best to sort of get out and sort of learn the sport and become better at it. You start tennis at the age of 11. I believe you... Yeah, it's very late. I played all team sports. And then one day in primary school, Susan Williams asked me, do you want to play tennis? I go, what's tennis? She's, really? You don't know what it is? I said, I have no idea. What do you do? And she says you get to run, jump, and hit a ball. I said, oh, three of my favorite things in sports. Okay, I'll try. You know, I'll try. So we went to a country club because her parents are well off. And my dad was a firefighter, so when I saw that, I go, there's no way I'm playing tennis. But we played that day and I really liked it. And then the first time I went out, they actually had a public park system in Long Beach, California. And we had free access to the courts and coaching. And at the end of the first day, I knew what I wanted to do with my life, that I wanted to be number one tennis player in the world. And I told my mom when she came to get me, and she goes, calm down, you have homework, you have this. I said, mommy, you don't get it. This is it. Now I'd say I found my destiny, but it was just part of the destiny. So fast forward one year, I'm playing to get a ranking now. That's how you get a ranking is. And we're at the Los Angeles Tennis Club, and I was daydreaming. And I started to realize that, everybody wore white shoes, white socks, white clothes, played with white tennis balls, and everybody who played was white. And I said, where is everybody else? You know, where is everybody else? This is ridiculous. So, and I thought about my sport. The one great thing about tennis and a few other sports, it's truly, truly global. We're talking, it is global. And I knew that was wonderful, because I always, wanted to travel, but then I visualized it as a platform, even though I didn't know the word platform then, but I visualized this is an opportunity. So I made a promise to myself that year that I would fight free quality the rest of my life. And that's what put me on my real journey. Yeah, because this happened to you at a very early age, realizing and noticing that it's quite a difficult thing to sort of come across, seeing that in a sport that like, you know, that you're playing. There is no one really playing either, not many women playing at the same level, but also no people of color being involved. Not many people of color involved. So I think that's quite inspiring that this was sort of like the thing that inspired. What, at what age did you have this realization? Was this about when you were still very young at about 11, 12? I mean, when I realized about people of color? Yeah. Well, this is I know this is hard for this group to imagine. But television had just come out in the States anyway in the United States in the late 40s and early 50s. So I'm a child of the 50s. So all of us would go down to one of our neighbors to watch the television together because they were the only family to afford one. And it was just fascinating. But I also saw some tough, terrible things in the southeast where children of color, or they were called Negroes then, were not allowed to go and study with white children. And I remember asking my parents, what's going on here? Why can't they go study together? And my parents said because she was a woman, she's a girl, and they said, because she's a negro. And that was politically correct in that day. And I said, well, that's not right. They said, well, isn't, you're right. It's not right. But that's the way it is. So that I think having that experience on a few occasions and just reading about it and just start thinking and asking questions, it was real easy to decide on fighting for equality the rest of my life. That was just, that was one of the easiest decisions I ever made. No, absolutely. And earlier you mentioned in our conversation that, because at that point, a platform didn't exist. Tennis, becoming number one tennis player, gave you the platform to sort of be able to advocate for this sort of thing as well and sort of enabled you a bit more. I knew as a girl, that was a disadvantage, though. I knew that people listened to boys. I already knew I was a second-class citizen. I already knew girls of color had it much worse. People that were living with disabilities had it worse. I mean, I got that picture at 11. I don't know why or how or 12. And I knew it. And I was very, it was just, I didn't like it. So, but I knew as a girl that I hopefully would be number one, maybe people would listen to me, but they usually listen to men. Men get a lot more attention, a lot more media. Just to go fast forward to now, 40% of professional athletes are women. And we only get 4% of the media. And that's why you don't know who we are. Yeah. If you don't see it, if you don't see them, if you don't read their stories. What makes an athlete exciting for people is their story as a human being, not how you hit a forehand or a backhand. What are they doing with their lives besides winning or losing tennis matches? That's not the essence of a person. So these are the things, that's pretty clear as a young person that I'd have to overcome those things. Yeah. Also one of the biggest, one of the bigger things that you're known for is also the Battle of Sexes match with Bobby Riggs that you had, which is who was also considered one of the greatest of the game. Yeah, he was a Hall of Fame. Yes, he was a great player. He won the Triple Crown at Womwellyn. So what brought about, what I'm interested in is what brought about that game in the first place, how did inception begin? And also what impact do you think it had on tennis after that? I had a huge of them back, but I want to quickly try to get you there because why did it matter and all that. In 1968, tennis became a professional sport. That's when we finally got a check. I used to get a 45-pound gift voucher when I won Wimbledon. 1968, we finally got a check. Broad labor got 2,000 pounds. I got 750 pounds. I went, oh, no. I got less. I can't believe it. 37.5%. Okay. That's going to be another fight later. I can't worry about that right now. So I was trying to get the men and women together as an association. I thought we should be together. I always want men and women to be together. That's my first want. They rejected us. We just got rejected and rejected all the time. So finally, nine of us in 1970, signed a $1 contract with Gladys Helman, who was the publisher of World Tennis Magazine. And we were willing to give up our careers and our everything for the next year. generations. And here are the three things. Number one, we wanted any girl in this world. If she's good enough, would be able to compete, have a place to compete. Number two, that we'd be appreciated for our accomplishments, not only our looks. And number three, the most important to us, because we'd all lived on $14 a day for years, this group, is that you could make a living playing tennis. Okay, those are the three things. So we started a tour in 1971. So let's fast forward now to 73. This is when I played Bobby Riggs. We're only in our third year of professional tennis. Men and the women. It wasn't just the women. And we had 90 million people watch it. People got into it for weeks ahead of time. You have no idea of fighting, discussing, emotional. And so we had 90 people all over the world watch it. And he, of course, said that he could beat me. But what had happened in May of that year is that he'd beaten Margaret Court, who was number one at the end of the year. Because I never wanted to play Bobby. But since Margaret lost, did he want, I had to play him. Anyway, it was crazed. No, it was crazy. People were talking. No, you can't believe the bets that were going on. like the guys, like, I'll bring you coffee every morning. I have to make breakfast for the family. And then the women was, it was crazy, the bets. And all the colleges and universities were totally into it. With the fraternities and sororities were going crazy. Because they had about six weeks before the match. So when I beat him in straight sets, that was huge for social change. Because it made people, because they had to stop and think about a lot of things before the match. Then I beat him, and he's a lot older than me, and I kept saying he's my dad's age. Come on, it's not a big deal to beat him. Everybody's, oh, he'll beat, you know, she'll kill him. So that was really helpful. The very next day in the United States, you couldn't get on a tennis court. So I think that is the most important match to grow our sport. And then it started in others' countries saw it as well. That's why it's so important. And it changed a lot. And we had Title IX and just been passed the year before in seven, And for the first time, if a school, like here, received federal funds that for the first time had to spend it equally on men and women. Before that, there were quotas for the women. The fact, at Harvard, it was 5%, I think, at medical school. So that's why we had no women, doctors, and lawyers. That completely changed. But there was, it's 37 words, and one word in there is activity as well. and the co-authors couldn't decide whether leave it in or take it out. They left it in, thank God. Otherwise, there would be no athletic scholarships for women. Men had always had them. We had never had them. When I was at college, I had to work two jobs, and I thought I was living large. So it was amazing difference. That's why there's something. And that's why even people from here or any other country in the world can get a scholarship in their sport. It's because of Title IX if you're a woman. So when you, it's good for women to understand that. Most of the time they don't. The coaches don't even know half the time. But that law is huge. Yeah, no, absolutely. And just like that is, that is probably one of the biggest events slash tournaments in your life and match. Do you have any other events that were, perhaps was your favorite for some particular reason? My favorite's team. I grew up in team sports. I love, basketball was my first love. I love team sports. So anytime I can play for my country, anytime. I could play for a school, anything. I love team. I prefer team. I love mixed doubles the best, than women's and then singles. Oh, wow. I know, did I blow your question? No, no, that's not. I guess, what? I mean, not winning singles at Wimbledon or something? No. I mean, you've also had a very long and successful career, and the impediments you've had, the difficulties you've faced, and you've been the person, sort of the breaking force, in this industry, in this area. What kept you going throughout all of this? It must get very difficult when you're being rejected constantly, when you're not treated equally, when other people are being given thousands of pounds, when you're given a voucher of 45 pounds. Like what keeps you at that point just going? That, okay, I can't go hopeless. This is just like one. Okay, first of all, don't take anything personally. I don't take things personally, and it works. Because you can't believe how much energy people spend on it. Don't spend any time on it. Because it's not about you, it's about the person who said it. They're the one that said something. And everyone's doing their best. Don't have to agree with everybody. But I always visualize and dream about what I wanted to look like. Like I wanted professional tennis. Well, what did that look like? Or I wanted a tour. Well, the men rejected us. So I wanted a tour for the women. What does that look like? What is whatever? And you want to grow the tour. You don't want it just to be in the United States. I mean, I always wanted to be global, which it is now. It's all over the world. But I envisioned that when I was, you know, we're first in it. And you keep trying to help. And of course, each generation has to do it. Like all of you here are our future leaders. You're it. And you're probably already leading. You're leading. So I want you to think about that. Don't take anything personally, okay? That'll really help you in life. Don't do it. That's fantastic. It just gets in the way. But one of the things that I wanted to ask regarding the thing that I just completely escaped my mind was, I realized there was a movie about the Battle of Sexes. Yeah, Emma Stone. Yes, Emma Stone portrayal of you. What do you think of that? I thought she was amazing. Do you think that portrayal was accurate? You have to remember that movies are a story in documentaries are usually more truthful. So it was just a small little part, but that's what they have to do. I mean, they only get two hours to tell a story. Some of it, the tennis part, was excellent. I thought they did a great job. But I think the important thing to know, too, is I was trying to figure out my sexuality in the 70s. late 60s and 70s. That was the horrible thing for me because people on the tour also said I had a lot of pressures outside but more inside probably that if I said anything about what I was feeling that there wouldn't be a tour. No pressure. So that was there plus just personally trying to figure things out. I was married to Larry. King is his name. That's why I still have a king and I told him I needed to get a divorce and he wouldn't give me one. That's another challenge I had because he didn't want to give me a divorce. But I eventually figured it out and I was outed in 81, but I lost all my endorsements within 24 hours except one. So I lost everything. I had horrible letters. The sponsors just wrote, I should have kept the letters. I didn't. I threw them out. But they were shocking what they said and what they said about me. And in the 70s and 60s and kids today go, what's the big deal? It was a big deal. Now there's celebrations. Like Jason Collins, who played in the NBA, he came out just before he retired. He got a call from President Obama. He had a job immediately, the NBA. It is totally the opposite of what it used to be. So I think that's been to be your authentic self, it depends on who you are on your journey. But for me, I would say that's the toughest journey I've had. Yeah. Understandably so in the context of time as well, when you were starting your career, when you were in the midst of your career. But I think some of the issues still exist around now, increasingly now recently there have been debates about transgender athletes in different sports and in tennis. What is your opinion on that? My opinion is, okay, I have, that's another tough one. It's a great one, though, is that I always want every person to get a chance to play. So we're talking about 99% of what we're talking about, that's what's going to happen. It's the 1% is what all the arguing is around. It's because if a transgender athlete wants to, let's say they're transgender, now they're female, and she wants to be on a team and she keeps winning. And, of course, there's a group of people who think it's just testosterone. Then I've been talking to scientists and listening. I keep trying to, I don't have a final, final, but, you know, You could put an extra person on the team. There's all kinds of ways to do this, but if they truly have an unfair advantage, I would still try to figure out how can everyone have a chance to play and figure that out. And there's ways to do it. I don't know how perfect it is, but we do have to address it and continue to address it. And I don't think testosterone is quite enough because I know there's two people, men, in the Olympics, won gold medals that their testosterone was so low that they would be considered a female with their level of testosterone, but they're men and they want a gold. So, and that's never come out, and I don't know who they are, which is so I can tell you. But, like, so it's not that easy. But we've got, I don't, what a lot of these laws are doing in the States is they're keeping, like, a 12-year-old from playing recreational sports. I'm sorry. I can't. I can't. I think they should be able to play. Yeah. No, absolutely. So I don't have the final answer. Some groups do. They think they know. And they do it on testosterone. Yeah. So last one of the more sort of serious questions was that because there were a lot of issues around that time. And some of those still like spill on today, sort of the issue, for example, in 1971, when Roe v. Wade was being argued in the Supreme Court, you had around that time a sort of. I had an abortion. was revealed by your husband. Well, he shouldn't have done that either, but that's a whole other discussion. But yes, I did. I write about it. And it's being debated today again. Oh, it's terrible, yeah. A lot of these changes, I feel like, have been, we're going backwards in some of these things. Well, that's a lot. If you look at politics, if you look at everything, it goes. That's why the more you know about history, the more you know about yourself, but more importantly, it helps you shape the future. And that's who you guys are. The more you know about history, the more you know about yourself. And it helps you shape the future. The reason I was able to be a leader in tennis is because I knew all the history of tennis from the 1800s. I knew, and also my former husband, Larry and I, own tournaments. And when you're on the other side, when you're putting up the money, you learn what sponsors want. Players just want more. I want more money. I want better hotels. as I want more, more and more. It doesn't work like that. So the one thing that helped me the most in being in a leadership position is understanding each person's what their wants were. And that's really important to understand that with each person I listen to and talk to and ask questions. Yeah, absolutely. So now sort of like the sport in general for women, particularly tennis, has advanced. There is a lot of commercialization of the sport. So what I wanted to ask was, do you see any concern with this commercialization of the sport, particularly women in tennis, as Emma Raducanu came to the Wimbledon with very expensive sort of Tiffany earrings, and people raised concerns regarding that, that there is sort of some commercial aspects of ruining the sport? What is your view on that? I love it. I love money. And I want, and women are taught not to follow the money. All you women, follow the money. Men do much better. Because with money, you can do great things. She's earned it. That goes back, every time a woman gets any money in tennis, goes back to 1970, and the day we formed the original nine. They are living our dream. Our dream was what? Compete, make money. I'll give you an idea. You know that what we did, you know, we had hardly anything, but Serena Williams made almost a hundred, million on the court, hundreds of millions off the court, but she has an investment company, Serena Investments, that she's going to get back and try to help women and particularly women of color. So I think is great because if she didn't have that money like our generation, we couldn't have the privilege of doing that. So I think it's, I love it. I love when people make money. It's what you do with it that matters. And I'm telling you, it helps you help others. And I'm big on it. No, I think it's great. I think it's great. She had a year. I mean, come on. She won the that's open, didn't lose a set. The only thing that people were concerned with is she hadn't really earned it. And I'm like, yes, she did. Those two weeks she did. It's called, forget it, onward. Yeah, I know. I was serious. You know, and she spoke so great in the, in the finals. She had everyone mesmerized for like two weeks. Yeah. No, we had standing room only. For women, everybody goes, we can't sell tickets. We can't do this. You know, everyone's always trying to tell us what we can't do. Boy, what a day. Yeah. So do you have any, I mean, one thing that is particular to you is like your experience from your perspective on throughout your career. Do you have a favorite anecdote from your career where you had sort of an interesting interaction slash an interesting anecdote of a match or a tournament? Well, I love being around Muhammad Ali. I'm sure you know that name. I'll tell you a difference though, because he and I were about the same age. We were, well, we were about the same age. And they had more about him and what a great athlete he is and all these great things. And then when I played Riggs, Howard Gosell, this is what happened to women, Howard Gosell only talked about my looks when they had me coming out for the match. With Bobby Riggs, they talked about his Hall of Fame, he won Wimbled, not once. that they talk about my accomplishments. Do you know how irritating that is? So anyway, it's very irritating. And Muhammad Ali and I would talk because I just love this guy. He's one of my favorite people ever. And we talked about you never know how another person is going to touch your life or how you're going to touch theirs. You never know how another person is going to touch your life, how you're going to touch theirs. And so we talk about being alert as you go through the day, as you go through every experience you go through stay in the now stay with the person be attentive also you'll do better in your studies when you really are attentive you know no mind stay in the now in the now is how you're in the zone in sports we talk about it all the time in the present and when you're taking a test when you're listening to someone or whatever if you can stay with them and stay with yourself you will have the best results that you can do that day And it's really important to do that daily. But anyway, you're ready for the next question. I'm telling you. Thank you very much. You're so funny. I really enjoyed the interactions before this interview as well. Yeah, we had fun. And learning about yourself, it's been very inspiring. But I think it would be better for me to move the questions now to the floor because there are a lot of people who have been thousands of yours that are here. So firstly, thank you very much for answering my question as well. and we'll now open to the floor for questions. I do have a couple of things, but go ahead. Yeah. We can... Do you want me? Yes. We can go to the questions afterwards. All right, I'll just say this. You'll never or we never understand inclusion unless we've been excluded. We never understand inclusion unless we've been excluded. And I can't believe how many people who basically have never been excluded are telling us about this sometimes. I'm like, squeeze me, squeeze me? So I think that may help you. And there's three things, I can do it at the very end if you'd like, but there's three things I think it might help you in your life. And you're very young, and this might help you every single day. And they don't have to be in this order. And a friend of mine, Ed Willard, who is president and CEO of DuPont, He and I would talk about this for three years. We talked about it. And we talked about inner success and outer success. What do the people look like? Who are they that have both? And we kept looking and talking, oh, that guy or this girl. I think they, maybe they're happy and they're doing really well. Here are the three things. Relationships are everything with yourself. You can figure it out. smart you guys that's why you're here um relationships are everything with yourself your loved ones just as you go through the day relationships or everything think about what's important with you your friends your family your your teammate or whatever number two keep learning it's perfect for you guys keep learning and keep learning how to learn keep learning and keep learning how to learn keep learning and keep learning how to learn. And the third one is be a problem solver and an innovator. And as a jock, as an athlete, all you're doing is problem solving the whole match. That's all we're doing is problem solving. Okay? Just when you're playing, just think about that. And love it. Love the challenge of solving the problem. And it's fantastic. And then, of course, we found that people, if you can be innovative, particularly today, how fast things are going with technology. I mean, your generation and the next generations, things are happening so fast that that really, I hope that second one helps you to keep learning how to learn. Because it's, look at his foot now. And my day would be like a snail crawling. You guys would be thinking, oh, my, can you believe, you'd be going, oh, can you believe this? Anyway, those three things, I think can help you in life every day. Absolutely. Thank you very much, firstly. First of all the... That's right. Yeah. Thank you. All right. So we will open to the floor for some questions now to see what the members want to ask. Okay. You know I'm dying to ask him questions, don't you? Go ahead. You're the boss. The member right at the front there? Yes, the blue jumper. Hi, yeah, there's a few of us from the tennis club tonight. I met the women's tennis team. I didn't see any of the guys. As women, I think we take for granted quite often the opportunity to go to training tonight and the matches, and that's all due to the work that you've done. So I just want to say thank you on behalf of everyone, all the women in the tennis club. My question is on the all-white clothing room at Wimbledon and at some other elite country clubs and tennis clubs. country clubs and tennis clubs and I think uh... white tennis clothing rules sometimes causes a lot of worries people especially if they're on their period so what's your thoughts on this do you think this tradition should continue could you please uh... did you hear exactly i didn't hear exactly what's the question do you think the all white clothing rule should i can't stand all white i've uh... when we started the women's tour is that what you're asking about all white clothes yeah in wimbled oh during your period or what which one No, we have everything. I can talk about. Do you think they should continue to wear all white? Absolutely not. We had all white when I started to play, and one of the things that the women wanted to do was to change that. We fought like crazy with the Wimbledon committees. We got it up to 51% had to be predominantly white, so we could have color. If you look at in the 70s, we had color on our dresses and added, you know, we liked it. And we want to have more, authenticity of what the person might like and design. And I mean, I love design and fashion and all that. It's like, please, let each person have what they want. If it's doubles, I think they should wear the same colors. Or, well, it's all white. You're right. But I can't stand it. And so I think we should have. And I think the name should be on the back. Every time you turn on a match, you go, who's that? I don't know who they are. I'd have numbers. I'd have a name, a number, but I come from basketball. And I would never let an empire tell them to be quiet. I can't stand that. I don't like it. No, I think it's about the fans that matter. The players are there for the audience. For some reason, athletes think, oh, they're here for me. No, we're entertainers. Our job is to make you happy. I don't know why athletes don't understand that. We're entertainers first. And our job is to make those people, when they go home at night, go, wow, I want to go back. In fact, I think I'll start tennis. Or I used to play. I think I'm going to take it up again. Tennis was voted. Not voted. Mayo Clinic in the U.S. did research. Tennis is the healthiest sport. That's another gift. It's the healthiest sport. And we live almost 10 years longer than average if you play. Not when you're young. You gotta play as you go older too. Like, my, but no, if you're older particularly, if you play it really helps. Yeah, no, thank you. I'm sorry, I get a little wound up here. No, no, that's perfect. For other questions, the member right over there. Just a shout-out, but please be louder. Right here. I'm there. Yeah. Thank you. Hello, Ms. King. Hi. Thank you so much for everything you've done for women's sports and beyond. And I'm wondering, in America, do you think we're going about any of our current movements for equality in the wrong way, or would you recommend that we take a different sort of approach toward the issues we face today? My prayer is that I know it probably will never happen, because usually race comes first and genders later. But if you take all women, and I wish the men were with us, all you guys believe in us as much. If we started together, would boycott things, would do whatever we need to do, would change everything. If you even look at sporting events, I mean, I'll get really make it easy. Half the audience, or 45% of the audience is usually, and these are men's sports I'm talking about, are women. And what if they didn't buy a ticket? I also think corporations I'm going to start probably doing it because I don't care. I'm old now. I don't care what they do. Is that I want to challenge corporations that are you spending as much on women's sports as you do men's sports? And if you don't, we're going to let the world know it. And if the women who are the buyers of this world would get their act together and realize how much power we really have, we're half the population, just like guys all did something. They're half the population. I would like it's all to be together. but whoever is the underdog we need to make it different and we together could change the world. Now when we talk about race, usually what people think of is they think about the race first, particularly women, and I totally understand, I listen to my black friends and Hispanic friends and all, but I go, but you're only, like in the state, you're only like 14%. But if we're all together, then we're at least 50 and I'd like something like, you know, we could be more than 50%. That's when things start to change, because you have purchasing power, you have power. And that's why money is important, by the way. So I just, it's so, I visualize most of my life that we are so, we spend so much money, we're so powerful, we show up, we always support, and yet we're not equal. So, yeah, I want to change things, don't you? come on thank you I'm sorry I'm gonna I'm just I know you probably think I'm crazy I'd like a person of color here to tell me if that's a bad idea here you go you're a person of color would you tell me is that horrible when I just said yeah you or any of you together as a team I don't care seriously no wait I'm serious do you think that's horrible the way I think or I think there's also the question of this intersection yes I don't mean, I mean, not much, not white women. I don't mean black. I mean women. Not white women. Okay. Whoever. Or all of us, but do you think it's about I didn't have all this together? No, I mean, we should all this together. We're much more powerful. I just used the black as an example, not everything. I mean, I mean, we could use an Asian we can use. Yeah. If they go race first, I think we should go together. Yeah, absolutely. And it's a very well-intentioned thing, and that your whole life has been in a way sort of a struggle for equality on every level. As you said earlier, that when I joined the sport, I asked the question, where is everyone? And I think that sort of encompasses how your goal has been for the most part of your career. Oh, it's it? Yeah, to champion this sort of equal, like, you know, equality, not just in the sport, but on a general level, send a message of sort of, you know, that people aren't, this is because of the societal impediments that women are left behind, not because of some inherent disadvantage. Just like I think men should get paternity leave. Why not? It's important to babies to have the men around, I think. I think it's huge. Absolutely. Well, thank you very much for the question as well. Any other question? The member right over here, please. Yes. Am I getting too heated here? Am I getting too heated? No, it's fine. I don't care. Can you open it? Oh, I'll, yeah, thanks. Thank you. Go ahead. I've played tennis since quite a young age, and more recently I've been coaching. And one thing I've noticed through both playing and coaching is that when girls start to reach the age of about 12, 13, they often tend to drop out of tennis or just sport in general. Have you got any of? advice in terms of trying to encourage girls to continue playing, not necessarily on a competitive level, but more just for social and health and that kind of thing. We've done research on that. The Women's Sports Foundation, which I founded in 1974, has done a lot about that. And one of the things we try to do, because girls are all about relationships. Have you noticed on a team and everything? It's all about relationships. And it's really important to, because they like their friendship is the way to keep with them in it. And we try to get them in groups sometimes and to stay in it. We talk to them about not dropping out and why is so important. Culturally, we don't have the psyche or the support the guys have always had through the years. I mean, so it's, but that's where you as a coach can make a huge difference. Huge difference. We need more women coaches. Women should be coaching men. That's why I love Andy Murray. You know who that is maybe. Anyway, he's fantastic because he believes in equality and he gets upset because his mother coached him. Judy just is, she's a force for play. She worries about play, not tennis, but tennis obviously will try to get him in eventually because it's a lifetime sport, which I think is why it's another, it's been been great for me but it's it's not easy but that's where people are so important and that's where you as a coach are vital that you can help them yeah absolutely thank you very much we'll we'll choose a few more questions oh I love it I love but you guys you're teaching me I love remember on the front row there oh the second row sorry yeah Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. My question is going to be related to where you talk about in terms of inclusion and exclusion. Could you please speak louder? I can't understand one thing. What's wrong with me? Sorry, can you hear me? No, it's not you. I think it's the acoustics. No, my question is just about kind of what's your thought on the inclusion of Russian players in tennis and if you have any view on that? You're talking about tennis now? Russian players. Oh, Russians will actually. interesting, Djokovish has now been okayed. I know he's not Russian, he's Serbian, but he's going to be able to play the Australian now. So I'm wondering if that's going to open up for the Russians. Is that what you're asking? Like when they played Wimbled and they can get any points? I personally would include them because that's when I founded the WTA in 1973, one of the big things is we always want everyone to have a chance to play as well. That's, of course, my philosophy. But we do feel that way very strongly. and so I would not keep the Russians out. I would let them play. The member at the back list? How do you know? I wouldn't know who to choose. Hello. My question is, what do you think about the diversity in tennis today in terms of both the progress that's been made and also what you think needs to be done going forward? For diversity? Yeah. In tennis? Yeah. When we started the tour, we only had mostly white girls. And one of the things I talked to Gladys Helman, you know, that person I had the $1 contract with. I went to her and I said, if we're going to have diversity, we've got to let people in. We've got to go find them. And we had three black women who I thought, and if they do play with us, They've got to be good enough that they're not embarrassed, that they look good, they're competitive. And that wasn't easy. So we went to the American Tennis Association, with such a black association that was formed in 1916, so they'd have their own. And of course, they let everybody play in their tournaments. They taught us a lesson. So we got three women on the tour, and that's where things started for us, because at least, there's visibility and they were good enough to play, which is really important. We want them to look good. We never want to put them in a bad place. So that wasn't easy because some places did not want them. And that was real easy for me. I went to the tournament desk and said, if you don't take care of them properly, just like us, I will tell every player we're not going to play. And they said, really? I said, yes. They're off. We're all together. So they did take care of. I still in touch with these three players, by the way. Bonnie Logan was the first black woman to play on our tour. She's still going strong, all three of them. And Ann Cogar, so it's Celia Hooks. So all these kids are good, but that's why we have Serena in Venus. But I wanted to tell you about my Shiro, and that's Althea Gibson. When I was 13, I saw her play. And if you can see it, you can be it. But you know when you say, I want to be number one? What does that mean really? So I saw Al Thigh Gibson, and she was the first black player ever to win a major. And blacks were not allowed to play in the big tournaments until 1950. So when I saw her, I was 13. So I knew what number one looked like. I went, oh, that's how good I'm going to have to be. In fact, I'm going to have to be better than that because my parents taught me that every generation is better. And quite, you know what, they're right. You guys are better than my generation or, you know, because of all the things that happen. So anyway, seeing her, and then, of course, I read her book, I slept with it. I mean, I'm terrible. I sleep with all these tennis books and, um, But she was my first hero in the sport, and she happened to be black. I just thought of her as number one. Of course I knew she was black, but she was number one. That's what I cared about. And she was huge. Without her, there never would have been in Arthur Ash. There never would have been about three women that were on the tour. They never would have been in Zena Garrison. There never would have been all these blacks. Serena and Venus, but bang. So I don't know if you know any of these names, but Serena and Venus have transcended. our sport. They're just great. So you think it's at the moment, the diversity as it is, do you think it's come quite a long way? It's come. I wouldn't say, it's come along, but some countries have very few people of color. I mean, if you go to Scandinavia, if you go to certain, they don't, there aren't. So that's why sometimes you think why in that country, you have more. So you have to analyze each situation to know what's right. But yes, we need, we're all human beings. We all bleed red. It's just so obvious that we have to work together and be together and figure it out. And also, I always encourage young people, particularly, to talk to someone who's not like them. Because the natural tendency is like speaks the like. Probably if you look around here, you're all together, the likes, the like, okay? We just do it. And I try to be really aware when I do that, that make a point not to always be with like speaks to like. Because, you know, it's comfortable when you're really down and out and you really want to be just comfy, go for it. But I don't know. I think it's more fun to have different friends that come from different places. And I don't know, it's more exciting to me. Yeah, I mean, that's why I want to ask you questions the whole night. I'm like, let's talk to you. They've probably heard you though, haven't they? Have they heard your story and everything? I presume so. I don't know. No, but you're so full of courage. And so what you've been through for a young person, I can never imagine. And that's why I want to ask questions. Like, understand you, you know, what you've been through and why you do want to make the world a better place, right? Absolutely, yeah. How are you going to do that? I know how you're doing. Do education and what are you doing? Yes. Well, I mean, people want to hear more about yourself. That's okay. They're hearing from me. It's enough. No, but you do want to help the world to be a better place through. Absolutely. Education and something else. Yes, and sort of overcoming, you know, I think especially in more deprived areas of the world where there is sort of, where there is, sort of, where there is. sort of the lack of opportunities in general slash recognition of these people. And I think sort of putting that, especially in regards to refugees, I think that's very important that I, that is something that I'm passionate about and I've been working on because, you know, people are put it in a disadvantage because of external factors out of their hand. And I think it's our responsibility, people in more privileged position, to be able to do something about it. But that is... I agree. No, but, you know, every single human, human being wants representation. Every single human being wants representation. Pretty obvious, isn't it? That's why it's important to have compassion for others. Empathy is a huge important factor they've learned in leadership. Leaders with empathy do a much better job than leaders who die. And we've got a lot of leaders leaders I think that have no empathy they're narcissists so that's the whole not I want I think you really get into that yeah but no it's just anyway I want to thank you because I know that you're just getting started you're young and I hope things go well thank you so much it's such a pleasure it's such an honor to have this from yourself as well but we'll have I mean I think that would be probably enough for the questions but also just any last remarks from any message that you want to leave tonight with the with the young tennis players that are here slash young people who look who've looked up to you who sort of admire you for what you've done throughout your life any message that you'll leave them with that they should follow through throughout I think there's been a few I hope haven't there been enough I mean the one thing I think it's important is to dream it and build it dream it build it and don't be go for it it may or may not happen you'll have a different dream and you'll go for it you know I don't think of losing so much as a failure. I think it is feedback in life. You know, when I hit a ball and it goes in, that's feedback. When I hit a ball out, that's feedback. Everything's feedback. But I want you to know your strengths. You know what everybody talks about us practicing our weaknesses? All champions practice their strengths every day. And we make our weak, the weaker shots. more, we try to get them to be adequate that it'll still do the trick when you, under the pressure of winning. But what makes great champions usually in sports and in other things is that they know their strengths. So know your strengths and hold on to them and practice them every single day. It doesn't matter what field of endeavor you're in. If you think about these things, it relates to whatever we do and keep, And just keep learning. Those three things I gave you, I think, are major. And not taking things personally. And understanding what real inclusion really is. Loving others, being good to others. And don't take things personally. When they start getting horrible, hang in there. And if you think you're in danger, get out of there. I mean, just, right? I mean, I don't know. I mean, just you have to, you have. And if you're going to talk to somebody, you better to know if you trust them. That's another. Just be careful. Thank you very much. Thank you. Oh, you terrible. Everyone's, this is... Yeah. This is my better half. Ilana Claus. No, we've been together 43 years, so we're still, hi. And I'm not done yet. I'm not. Tell my last breath, we're going to keep working for this, okay? Yeah.
