 Mr. President, honorable proposition, opposition members, honored guests. Welcome. You know, it's fascinating being here and listening to people from my own country, criticizing it so much. many of you know me I'm a former U.S. Senator, former ambassador representing our country in New Zealand, Cook, Nui, Samoa, our interest in Antarctica. It was a great honor to serve my country. I'm going to use a quote for somebody that I don't agree with a lot, but I have a tremendous amount of respect for, and that's President Joe Biden. And he said, and I quote, don't compare us to the Almighty, compare us to the alternatives. Now, I'm not sure if the proposition heard that quote or even cares to remember it, but what I've heard just now is the typical America bad spiel. Oh, yeah, bad, everything's bad. Everything's terrible, Israel. Oh, my God. You went to school in the United States, though. So you, I guess you spent some time there and you went to school, so you're probably part of that. And facts matter. We had our dinner upstairs, and the opposition, the opposition first speaker, pointed out your inaccuracies. And with regard to my running, yes, I've run 21 times. I'm 19 and 2. I'll take those odds any day. Listen, what you don't hear, though, from the proposition speakers is what is the alternative? What does the alternative actually look like? Well, you can look at China, you can look at Russia, you can look at Afghanistan, Iran. What does it look like there? A lower standard of living? Free speech, what is it? If you're in China and you're a Uyghur, you're in a reconditioning concentration camp. You know what's happening in Iran right now? I mean, come on. What's the alternative? To me, the... You can see me on Facebook later, actually. If we were in any of those countries, we wouldn't have the ability to have this conversation that we're having right here. It wouldn't be allowed. And what I see, for example, as the ambassador in the Indo-Pacific, I see what the alternatives are. I note that when we were in the Indo-Pacific and when we're dealing with issues, we're the first respond to natural disasters. We give by far the most aid and assistance to all the island nations and many nations around the world. What does it look like specifically? Well, with China, they're very good at debt servicing islands, creating massive debts that will never ever be repaid. That's the difference. Never ever been repaid and they will be in trouble for generations to come. Now, you know what a real global nightmare is to me? It's what's happening in Ukraine, right? right now with the war criminal Putin, raping, killing, murdering innocent civilians, and threatening to use nuclear weapons if he doesn't win his illegal war. That's a global nightmare. That is a global nightmare. You know, it's funny, I spoke to my daughters today. I speak to them 34 and 32 years old, and they wish me well. So dad, I can't believe you're going to defend America. And what the proposition also told you, or failed to tell you, is that we have 332 million people in our country. It's so diverse. We have different nationalities, religions, politics, economic issues, rich, poor, happy, sad, gay, straight. I mean, it doesn't matter. We are such a diverse culture. And yes, it's messy. Democracy is absolutely mess. But what's the alternative? They didn't offer any. They just want to... No, thank you. Not at this time. What is the alternative? Well, I can tell you that it's not what Isirah certainly pointed out. You know, the doom and gloom, the hate, it's unbelievable. For that, for all the things I've heard, I mean, in the proposition that the American Jew is now a global nightmare, there's no way that they've reached the threshold to actually convince you of that. So when you go through that door, you have to go through the left side. You have to. Now, stats matter. My first point is the American dream is alive and well. As I said, there's 332 million people. Each one of them, as the first opposition speaker said, are reaching and finding their own version of the American dream. And respectfully, Mr. President, I actually read your term card, and I was fascinated by it. And if I may. I'm moving to the UK in 2015, not speaking any English. I did not dare to dream so big about coming to Oxford. It was unfettered perseverance, hard work, and well, you can say a bit of luck that has brought me here to Oxford. It has been the journey that has taught me many lessons that I am grateful for each and every one of them. Listen, I get it. My mom and dad were married and divorced four times each. Yeah, if I didn't laugh, I'd cry. I'm not only a domestic abuse survivor, but a sexual assault survivor. It's not a day that goes by, I don't think about that. And I was arrested. I was drinking, driving, and stealing at 12 years old. And I'll tell you what, I was arrested. I used to steal food. I mean, it was a total shit show in my house. I used to have to sleep with a bat in my bed so one of my drunken stepfathers wouldn't break my fingers because I was a basketball player, and he knew that it was my dream to get out of that situation. And make no mistake, I am, they will say, oh, you're one of the lucky ones. Well, so are they. They are the elite of our country. Go to the best schools, make the most money, have the biggest bully pulpit, and now they're criticizing the American dream, it just doesn't raise to the threshold that it's a global nightmare, because if it is a global nightmare, then they are contributing to it, and I guess I am too. But I'm not. I'm here fighting for America, pointing out the differences that we have, aside for those shared common values that we all have, we are different societies, and we welcome that. Point number one, as I've been commenting on, also deals in statistics, which I know are a little fuzzy with you, Isra. And with respect, Professor, 72,000 startups versus 14,000 for India last year. We have among immigrants, 5.5% unemployment. The world's lowest unemployment, 3.5%. Income inequality, yes, it's real, it's serious. But what they failed to tell you is that 47% of all business in the United States is small businesses, like people like me, like my wife, my daughters. 47% of the whole theory about, oh, it's the big corporations running everything. Yeah, they have a lot of access, but 43% of the Fortune 500 companies are run by immigrants and their families today. So there's amazing opportunities. So it is alive and well. They, once again, did not reach the threshold necessary to say that it's a global nightmare. Point number two. The independent spirit of the American dream is why the U.S. leads the way in global innovation and development. How many people have an iPhone or get stuff delivered within days from all over the world? Or actually have a chance to use Google Maps. I've used it every day here. That's all American creations that have made the world a better place. That have actually made the ability for people to learn and grow and have more and different opportunities. We're an incubator of ideas. You referenced education. This is an amazing place. It really is. You're the luckiest people in the world. But we have 6,300 colleges and universities in our country. You went to some of our schools. Many people here I've spoken to have. And then you're taking that American ingenuity, the ability for you to think for yourself and actually take that around the world to your homes. And dream, like you, Mr. President, like everybody in here. To say the American dream is dead means that all of our dreams are dead. And there's no hope whatsoever. Well, I'm a glass half-full guy. From what I've been through in my life and all of the other people, I've learned from my mistakes. And we are a great country, sir. And we have shared common values. And when we have things like George Floyd, the system works. They went to jail. They were tried and went to jail. And there were protests, and they were right to protest. But through those protests, as we've done in our country's history, we learn and try to grow and be better. Democracy is messy, folks. And my third point is, we're not perfect, but we're not responsible respectfully for all the world's problems. Are you kidding me? I mean, really. And we're damned if we do, we're damned if we don't. Oh, in World War II. We didn't come in quick enough. Oh, geez, sorry. We didn't come in quick. But when we came, we really rocked it, didn't we? We came and we helped. And what did we leave behind? We left behind the Marshall Plan, which is still working today. Oh, and we went in too fast. We went through these countries. We did it without it. Go into the UN. Oh, my God. Give me a break. And we didn't get anyone else's permission. Well, you did it too quickly, and you didn't get help. And then if we don't do anything at all, I can't believe you didn't do anything. You can't win. We are not responsible for all the world's problems. So in conclusion, since Issa took about 20 minutes, I'll take an extra minute and say, in conclusion, my dream is pretty simple. It's something I dream for my daughters and my grandchildren every day. It's that we have a way to communicate to each other and not cancel each other out. People that we have great differences with, find common ground, find where we agree on things and work and move forward together. That's part of what makes the dream possible. That's what makes the dream of the humanity possible. It's finding solutions, working together. My dream for you is that you take what you're learning here and in your education here and take that home. Take those dreams home for a better state, city, state, country, world. Be part of the solution. Don't be the negative Nellies here who say the world is over, we're responsible over everything, and offering no alternatives. None, zero. Zero. What's the alternative? I referenced some already. I already talked about the global nightmares. North Korea. Kim Jun lobbying ICBMs around the world, threatening white people off the face of the earth. That's a global nightmare. Okay? So listen, it's been an honor, and I mean that. It's something that I've ever since you asked me, Mr. President, that I have looked forward to more than anything else in my life. And I have an amazing life. So I thank you. I certainly will be on my knees praying tonight asking that you have me back some time to speak because some of these topics are so great. I just can't wait to get into it, like I did with you at dinner with your factually incorrect statements all night. Thank you.
