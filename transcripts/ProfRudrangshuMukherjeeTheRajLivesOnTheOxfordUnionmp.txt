 Speaking next, it gives me great pleasure to invite onto the dispatch box, Indian historian and author, Professor Wood Rangchoo, Mr. McRergy. Mr. President, sir, as you and all members of this August House know, there is a rather obscure university on the banks of a very small stream called the camp. In that university, in 1968, Lord Louis Mountbatten gave the second Javallal Nehru Memorial Lecture. Following the lecture, unlike the custom of the Oxford Union, there was a dinner held at the Great Hall of Trinity College. Rising to speak in an after-dinner speech, in a voice choked with emotion, but nonetheless, heard even in the dim rafters of the great hall, Lord Mountbatten said Johalal Nehru Harrow and then Trinity College Cambridge he was one of us about the first Prime Minister of the Indian Republic what better testimony than this that the Raj lives on. There is a law in India, and I dare say there's one in Pakistan and Bangladesh and Sri Lanka as well. It is called the sedition law by which any opinion, any action, that the current or prevailing political dispensation dislikes, it can label as anti-national, as treacherous, and as a security risk. This law was drafted in the second half of the 19th century. It still hasn't been changed. We still live under the same sedition law that was created, drafted, implemented with great brutality. by the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent. What better testimony than this that the Raj continues to live? The name of Thomas Babington Macaulay, who went to that obscure university that I just referred to, has come up again and again on both. both sides of this great divide regarding the role of the Raj and whether it lingers on or it doesn't. But the point that hasn't been made, I'm sorry to say, on my side wrongly made in terms of chronology, is that Thomas Babington McColley drafted the Indian Penal Code in 1835, not in 1861, and that is the penal code that still exists in India. I cannot speak for Bangladesh and I cannot speak for Pakistan or Sri Lanka, but I can say that in India, the Penal Code that exists today is just a cut and paste of Thomas Babington McColle's Penal Code of 1835. Reference has been made from the other side to the great achievements of the Constituent Assembly which created the Constitution of India. The Constitution of India, I'm very sad to admit is again, to a very, very large extent, a cut and paste of the Government of India Act of 1935, which was created, implemented by the Raj. The Raj lives in more ways than we care to admit to ourselves. Reference has been made also to divide and rule, a legacy that still carries on under different political dispensations in India, no matter their color of their ideology. But let us also admit that it took an institution of the British Empire housed in the Chamber of the Oxford Union to bring together speakers from India and Pakistan to speak on a common theme. Daraj lives adversely, negatively, and in some rare cases, even positively. Ayoshi Agarwa make the point reading though she was from a prepared text that the Raj denuded and denied the Indian population of agency I would like her to ask herself does the Indian population, large majority of the Indian population, not those who come and speak in the Oxford Union, large majority of the Indian population, the tribal population, the underprivileged, the Dalit population, do they have agency? Do they have any say in any major policy decision taken by the Indian state? If Ms. Ayushi Agarwal thinks voting every four years constitutes agency, I can only pity her understanding of politics and political theory. Sorry. You make a very good ambassador, Mr. Adan for Bangladesh. But the praise and the statistics of the achievements of Bangladesh doesn't deny that the Raj continues to exist. I'm sure you will make a very good representation. representative of the Bangladesh Foreign Service. And maybe you will serve as Bangladesh's ambassador in Whitehall. Good luck to you. The Raj, I would like to emphasize this point. The Raj is not just the empire. The word Raj is derived from Raja. It's an idea that is derived from Raja, the state, the Sarkar. And that Sarkar, that state, still continues. Its manifestations and its articulations might be different and varied, but it continues. I would also like to point out very briefly those who are speaking against the motion, excoriating the rod, sometimes in very justifiable terms, based on very solid facts. They are doing so in a language that the Raj left behind in India. As Kaliban says in Tempest, as Shakespeare makes Kaliban say in the Tempest, you taught me language and I learned how to curse. The Raj is dead. Long live the Raj. Thank you. Thank you.
