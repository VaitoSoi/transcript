 Good afternoon, members, and welcome to our first event of term. I'm your president, Molly Mantle, and today I'm joined by Sir Geoffrey Nice. Sir Geoffrey has been embarrassed us since 1971, specialising in the fields of international human rights and criminal justice. Most recently, Sir Geoffrey chaired the Uyghur Tribunal throughout 2020 and 2021. Sir Geoffrey, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us today. Thank you. My real pleasure. If as I think you'd like me to kick off with a few sentences, I'll probably rather more than just a few. First of all, thank you very much for inviting me to speak and then for making it possible for me to do it remotely because of various reasons that made that more sensible. I'd like to talk about four things overall in the course of this hour, mostly I think probably by questions and answers with you, Molly. A little bit about me, because a little bit about me might be of value to those listening and watching who may be intended to have a career in the law, a little bit about the law, a little bit about a case called Sloboda Milosevic, maybe, who was the president of Serbia, who I prosecuted for four years before he died before the end of the trial, and then a little bit about the China Tribune. And in a way, knowing that people always and understandably take little from any talk or lecture, I hope that there will be some unifying theme of the development and the necessary development in our minds of how we view the law, national and international, and how it's important to be free in the way one thinks about the law, because it seems to me that people allow themselves to be committed to the form of law in which they live from a very early age and it's very hard to dislodge them even perhaps when they need to. And I started with a very simple understanding of the law when a policeman with a pointy helmet called at my house when I was less than 10 years old, asked for me by name, and I was terrified. And all he was doing was returning a book I'd lost, which had my name and addressing it. I'm still frightened of policemen, how young they are. But on a more serious note, you can talk to very senior members of the judiciary in this country and of lawyers. And they will probably all say, and genuinely believe that the adversarial system of law that we practice here is the best. in the world, which it obviously isn't, because if it was, people wouldn't keep on having to try and persuade people that it is. It's a rather strange system of law, adversarial, rooted in conflict and battle, not in any way an inquiry into truth and arguably of limited value to the modern world. And so I think thinking about how one thinks about the law is one of the things I'd like people perhaps to be able to get out of this hour. Before I hand over to you, unless you'd like me to continue with one of the other subjects, Molly, my own process was from wonderful parents and a school in South London, Catford, which was paid for by Lewish and Borough Council, because I was one of the real beneficiaries of the most generous of welfare states. From there I came to your university where I read or in my case probably skimmed or scanned a little bit of PPE. And then I noticed that all the rather well-heeled old Italians in Keble College were reading law. So perhaps that or maybe a bit of amateur dramatics led me to think that might be better for me. I gave up the possibility of becoming a spy, which was not certain but possible for many of us in those days, and did a few other things, came to the bar, and it was all terrible. easy because Lewisham Borough Council again paid the fees. I was able to start practice in the first set of chambers I landed up as a pupil, general common law chambers, never been in debt, and found it all quite easy. Why do I say that? And I say that because I recognize that things are very different now. It's much harder for people. And that hardness or harshness sounds misfortune, but in one way it's a good thing. I was just lazy and did whatever came my way. I didn't turn around and think hard about how I should invest my time and the money in education in making the right choices. Had it done that, I might have gone into a different bit of the law and had a totally different career. So that's how I started. And right from the beginning, I rather took the English legal system as OK-ish and we can move on from there. And if you've got some questions you'd like to ask me now, Molly, I will answer them. Nobody's put a question in the Q&A yet, or I can move on a little bit and say a bit more, your choice. Well, we'll leave questions from the members to the end, but do leave questions in the Q&A section at the bottom of your Zoom screen. We'll be sure to get to them. So you speak about adversarial law as opposed sort of injuptuosition to law that's finding truth. What do you think that we could be doing better, Sir Geoffrey? And is there a country that you can point to that you think, we should be trying to follow? Well, the first is difficult, and the second is the answer is no, I can't really point to a country that we can follow, but I'm very well aware that the adversarial system has been used by way of cultural imperialism right around the world from colonial days, right to the establishment of the modern international criminal tribunals, without any assessment of whether it's the best system of law for international work. Trying to answer your first question, In fact, the British legal system, imperfect though it may be, is moving away from some of the worst aspects of the adversarial system, starting really with its recognition that vulnerable witnesses had to be treated in a very special and different way. And once, fasty old judges who thought that everybody should, you know, the most combative possible in court, started to realize that prepared, careful, moderated questioning of vulnerable witnesses, and many witnesses, and many witnesses are vulnerable, they suddenly scratched their head and says, hey, that's possibly a bit better for everyone. And so everybody's gradually understanding. And I think people have to understand the bad things about the adversarial system and the way that questioning can be improved. So far as the international system is concerned, although I can't point to a country that's, I can't point to a country that's doing it better internationally because none of these modern criminal war crimes trials have been tried by any other method. What I can say is that the adversarial system applied to war crimes trials is a disaster. Trials last 10 years. One famous trial lasted 10 years, and at the end of that time, the three judges, one was a substitute for a judge who'd had to leave because he was prejudiced or thought to be unfairly. The two, he was, said the substitute judge agreed with the presiding judge. The other judge who'd heard all the evidence said that the two of them were basically bonkers, had disregarded all the law to reach a decision that they'd reached, with which she totally and completely disagreed. Ten years on that. Forget how the lawyers must have felt. What do you think the victims, the witnesses, and all the others who were interested in seeing an apparent legal process waste ten years of time, people dying of natural causes throughout to reach a decision that no one could possibly apply any value to. So it hasn't been tried and the modern war crimes trials have to be much more inventive and much more imaginative than what they can do. Perhaps we can come to that a bit later. You were the lead prosecutor in the trial of Milosevic and the Hague. Would you begin by telling the members that aren't familiar a little bit about their case? I suppose the question that I want you to answer is, do you think that the diplomatic delicacies involved in a case like that mean that inevitably statesmen will just get away with injustice? No, to the last point. But as to the case itself, I don't know whether there are people on this webinar who don't even know where the former Yugosavia was. and it was a federation of eight states on the eastern part of the Mediterranean by the Adriatic Sea. It came into being in the First World War, had different iterations since then. It was composed of six republics, which were not ethnically homogeneous at all. And it came to fall apart at roughly the same time as the Berlin Wall fell. And of the six parts, two separated easily because they were ethnically homogeneous, Slovenia and Macedonia. Of the remaining four parts, Serbia and Montenegro can be counted as one for all purposes of this conflict, so that means three. In the remaining other parts, Croatia and Bosnia, there were Serbs who, once the republics split apart, didn't want to live under any control but Serbia. So they carved out false Serb majority areas in both Croatia and Bosnia, hoping ultimately to hook those onto Serbia. In order to do that, in order to make mixed ethnic areas, they had to kill lots of people and boot the rest out. And so the combination of various crimes of killing and similar and ethnic cleansing occurred. So Milosevic, president of Serbia, was never at war, but we said that he was influential. We didn't use the word puppeteer, but he was very influential over the Serbs operating in Croatia, Serbs operating in Bosnia and indeed at the time of the Slovenian war, which was a very small one and also at the time of the subsequent war in Kosovo. So we were looking at this man as a man who was responsible for what was happening in the most terrible killings and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. And that was obviously a very difficult exercise because he could keep saying that he wasn't the direct controller of events. We had. material to show that he was highly influential and that he was telling the people what to do. But it was a very interesting and difficult case from that point of view. It lasted about four years and he died shortly before the trial was due to end. Now, there's one thing I'd like to tell you about that trial, but you may want to ask me another question first. We can come back to him. No, you're welcome to go ahead. Well, this has to do with the way one approaches legal issues generally. I've explained to you that when I was in England, I sort of swallowed it a bit, not all of it. I was never quite convinced that it was exactly as it dragged itself to be. So I went off to the Hague and was working with a very similar system. And you would think, wouldn't you, from outside, here's a legal system that's working. Well, if it's a small case, I did two other cases before Miloshvich, which are of no particular interest, nobody's going to bother. But Milozovic was a very important case for the international community, and people did bother. By people, I mean states and political leaders. And if you're inclined to think that politicians having created a court will let it be independent, well, I'm afraid that's a bit unrealistic. In the same way as I'm sure that kings of our own country, when they created systems that would have something to do with the law, never thought that the law would bite back and affect them. but of course ultimately all rulers do become subject to the rule of law. But until that happens, people were more than happy to interfere. And so in the case of, in Miloshavit, I learned for the first time on several occasions. And there is a book I've made available 20 copies for those of you who are going to get it. And you'll find all this set out in something called Appendix 1, possibly more interesting than the chapters, all the political interference I suffered. And this showed me that you can't leave a pure and clean record of conflict if there's a big state or in the case of the Bosnian conflict, more than one big state, more than one powerful state, that wants to interfere with the investigative process. And so the answer to your question is your question, will they escape justice? No, they won't. how justice is delivered to them may be moderated, modulated, affected by whether America, England, Germany, France, want certain outcomes. Having said that, the only two countries to which I can positively point as having attempted to manipulate me were America and England or Great Britain. You have the political interference, but you also deal with... I've got a cat. There's no door on this room, so the cat just comes in. I'm sorry, this is its time. That's okay. We love to be pets on Zoom. So you have the political interference. You also have been dealing with, have dealt with lots of cases that some people might call crimes against humanity throughout your career. How much has there been a conscious, linkage in your mind between ethics and the legal process and managing the politics? Or do you try and treat things in a strictly legal and technical sense when you approach your cases? It is essential that you will try and approach your case in a purely legal sense and are not affected by political considerations. And in the Hague, I did that and I hope I left a clean record. But of course, I was aware of things that were being tried out on me and sometimes successfully. I was not aware of the things I was not aware of. There may have been other things done of which I was not aware, which were manipulating the record. But it's absolutely crucial to leave the cleanest, straightest record that you can. And I might come back to that depending on other questions, and I see some questions are coming in. The same principle applied much later in my career in the last six years or five years when I found myself involved in things called people's tribunals. I never expected to get involved in these. I thought they were a bit nutty when I was first asked to work for the Iran Tribune. But I slowly and I became a bit involved in that and saw what great effect it had for survivors and bereaved and people like that. and how setting an accurate record was a really worthwhile exercise. I got involved in another such tribunal, and then two tribunals concerning China, the last one, the Uyghur Tribunal. And by that time, I'd worked out how I thought these things should be run. And the core issue, the core objective, was to ensure that this was the cleanest, most conservative, if you're allowed to use the word, fairest process there could be. By the way, I say if you're allowed to use the word, fair trial is a purely English concept. You can't even translate it into French and German. It's a strange term. But nevertheless, we'll use it because a lot of the people on this webinar, I think, of the 47 I can see numbered, are probably English language users. So it was central. if we just fix now on the Uyghur Tribunal that it should be the fairest conservative, cautious approach. And in the case of something like the Uyghur Tribunal, the objective was not to be activist in any way on behalf of the Uyghurs. We none of us were. We're not particularly interested in the Uyghurs beyond the way we're interested in Rohingya Muslims, North Korean prisoners, Nigerian Christians, or who assert that they're suffering at the hands of an overpowerful government. So we could be completely objective, just like a jury. We looked at the evidence. We applied the strictest test for proof. We applied the strictest and narrowest conception of the law. And we presented a fully public open analysis of the evidence. And that is something that may be of some value to some people some of the time. We hope so. We actually had a debate last term at this House. believes that the courtroom is no place for social justice. I wonder if you could speak to that point for a moment about those people who do try and treat law in a more activist sense. I probably need a concrete example, but I can draw one from the Uyghur Tribunal. And I'm not for one second suggesting that those who are, in the way you describe, activists in their desired use of the law, are other than well. intention of good people, not at all. And so, for example, one of the expert witnesses we had in the Uighur Tribunal produced a report well argued and so on that would have said the law on genocide could be expanded to include more things that we ultimately found it did include, to which are responsible and added a lower threshold of proof, not proof your reason for that, to which we said, first of all, thank you very much. for coming and helping us because he was one of the only lawyers who was prepared to help us, all the others duck for cover. And we said, and report writers duck for cover as well, but we said to them, well, thank you very much extremely helpful. But it is best that we stick with the narrow law because the expansion of the law is for other people, that is, say, judges in formal courts and politicians. And if you again come back to the concept of the jury trial, if you think what the jury does in an ordinary trial in this country and elsewhere, they come in, they listen to the evidence, they're told what the law is, not what they want the law to be. They bring in a verdict, they walk out and they disappear. And then everybody else comes in to get on with it. If the law is unsatisfactory, as interestingly enough, as we've heard, I think, is it Pretty Patel saying, following the acquittals in Bristol over, the statue being dumped in the river. If the law needs to be changed, I'm not for one second suggesting that I agree with her, but just if political change needs to follow a jury's verdict, politicians enter into it. If there's a conviction, you've got prison, social services, the judge imposing sentence, and so on. Lots and lots of other agencies. And they're all doing the same thing. They're acting on the basis of the finding of the discipline. passionate objective jury. And so no objection to lawyers being activists and lawyers being activists in many ways are very good things. They say, hey, come on, let's have assisted dying as a legal activity and so on. But that's not for us. The citizen has a People's Tribunal and a chap prosecuting a case, the Yugoslav Tribunal must stick with the law and just make it fair. Well, you mentioned the fact that you found most people weren't keen to help you on the Ouija Tribunal. Do you feel that generally the West has lost its moral standing by staying largely silent on the issue? The answer I argue will not be much pleasure to many lawyers in this country. Many of us were sanctioned by the People's Republic of China. including our tribunal and me personally and other lawyers who said various things. And there was one set of barrister chambers called Essex Court Chambers. They put up a report saying that it was genocide and they'd been sanctioned. What happened was that Essex Court chambers withdrew the thing they'd made public. Their chambers had some serious internal changes. people left and there were separation of a part of the chambers overseas. And apart from one or two bodies, the inner temple, bits of the bar council and one or two other bodies, was there a universal standing up of every lawyer in the country saying, for free speech, we stand, interference with free speech, we will have nothing to do? Not at all. And what about the so-called Magic Circle firms that is immensely powerful and immensely wealthy law firms in the city of London? Did any one of them say we support those who write with the advantage of freedom of speech in our country? We support them. Not at all. They all stayed silent because the power of money, if you're dealing with commerce, and just fear of big powers shut everyone up. And I landed up saying somewhere, I can't remember quite well, where most of my lawyer friends, they can argue in favour of freedom of speech. So it's not all aspects of morality, but freedom or ethics, but it's one aspect, Molly. I said they can argue for freedom of speech when, as it were, they're paid to do it on behalf of a client. but otherwise they don't seem to believe in it. It's a very, very sad conclusion to reach, but it's one I'm afraid I was obliged to reach on that occasion. Personally, sanctions didn't trouble me or my tribunal much or at all. I was going to ask, have the sanctions against you change the way that you view the issue personally or how you've approached it? Not at all, no. I mean, I'm completely untroubled by it. for my children, they will not apparently now be allowed to travel to Hong Kong or China until things change. And the only way it affected us, which was unfortunate, there was two ways in which it affected us. One was, at the stage that this happened, I'd secured two very senior lawyers of impeccable reputation to be the people who would advise us, as it were, tell us what the lawyers, be like a judge with a jury. and they were all keen and willing to do. They both had to withdraw, not on their own accounts, but on the accounts of damage that would have been done to others if they had stayed with us. And that's a pretty alarming position to find. And the other way in which it affected us was that we had a small team of lawyers called council, and they have had a very particular role to play in the tribunal. They were all men. And we had already proposed adding to them by a woman barrister. And unfortunately her chambers didn't approve. And alongside sanctions and the political things, I wanted to ask if you feel that legal aid cuts, and other sort of cutbacks that we've seen across the legal world have undermined the free and fair access to justice. First of all, I'm a long way away from being involved in cases actively, even as a part-time judge I finished in 2018. And even then I didn't get the full brunt of the cut in legal aid. And of course, I was, as I've already explained, launched myself when Legal Aid was extremely generous, and you could get it for nearly everything, which is why it was possible to start off and earn a living from the word go. However, it is quite clear to me that the sequential cuts in Legal Aid, which have had barristers at food banks and things like that have gone far, far, too far. And it's as if governments and not just this one, I think, have not understood the value for society of people being able to advance their rights. Fair trial, if that's not a universally understood word, when translated it becomes, in different languages, a matter of what your rights are. And your rights are all sorts of things to be treated fairly, not to be convicted if the evidence isn't against you, and so on and so forth, to have your unhappy family matters dealt with in a thorough going satisfactory way. And people, big and small, wealthy and poor, are entitled to have justice at the hands of the state. And none of the recent governments, I think, has quite accepted that. do I see that changing? Do I see any government going back to making legal aid much more generously available? I think not unhappily. Are many lawyers turning away from the possibility of doing criminal law right from the beginning criminal law, for example, but I suspect also other aspects, possibly a family who I don't know, which are poorly paid by the standards of overpaid lawyers. And lawyers are up. Many lawyers are overpaid. and over self-imported and all sorts of things. The answer is yes, I think people will continue to turn away from it. And I'm not sure what we can do about it. I'm keen to make sure that we leave time for audience questions. So if it's all right with you, Sir Geoffrey, I might move on to some of the questions that we've been asked in the chat. Yes, of course. The first question is from an anonymous attendee who asked, what do you think about the vilification of judges in the tabloid media? Well, extraordinary, really. and a demonstration of quite what an unhealthy society we're in. This particular vilification, I expect, of which the anonymous attendee is referring, was the enemies of the people. And it manifested a complete misunderstanding of the role of judges in our society, which those particular three judges manifested individually in the judgment that they gave. But this question helps me to come to one other really important thing about our legal system. I've already been dismissive of the idea that it's the best in the world. But it's very important if you're going to be critical also to recognize its qualities or its good points. And one really important, good point about the British legal system is that the senior permanent judges, in particular, most judges, but certainly the senior permanent judges, high court, court of appeal, circuit judges, even Supreme Court, are incorruptible. Did I say that? Was that just an act of faith? No, it's empirically provable. you will find almost no account of judges being brought into question for any form of corruption. Now, that's not because they're good people, by the way, because they're just ordinary people who happen to have become judges. They're not particularly moral, although they've, of course, worked all their lives with the rules of public morality. No, the reason our judges are incorruptible is because they're given so much. much in the way of quality of work, pay, pension, respect. There's far too much for them ever to lose. And if they were to put a foot out of line, so they never do. It is, I think, as simple as that. When you go to countries and the many of them where the governments themselves say to you, yes, our judges are corrupt, you always find that one of those things is missing. So this aspect of English society we've got right. and to have said what the Daily Mail said about those judges was completely inexcusable. And for any member of the government, and I think it was, Ms. Trust, wasn't it, who was the Secretary of State for Justice at the time, to be mealy-moused about her protection, the judges was completely inexcusable as well. There should have been a forthright defence of this aspect of the legal system, which presumably she didn't understand despite her position. Thank you. Another anonymous attendee asks, would you mind sharing it with us what the significance of the Wieda Tribunal notwithstanding its non-enforcement is? Do you think the rule of law can be disassociated from democracy? For example, a country or system is not purely democratic, but embraces rule of law. Hong Kong pre-national security law seems to point towards that direction. Well, there's a lot in that question. As to the first bit of it, when the first of these tribes, not the first, the first post-war of these tribunals were set up, it was set up by Lord Russell, the British philosopher and Jean-Postre, the French philosopher, and they tried the United States of America for criminality in the Vietnam War. you can make many complaints about that tribunal's process. But it is the only evidence-based process that's assessed in a public way, criminality by the Americans in the war in which they were pretty well undoubtedly war criminals in part. And that is almost non-contentious, but it's the only public record. Now, if you look at what Sartre says in his opening speech, he says a lot of things. He says, we're just here to fill a gap. And then he says, we are powerless. Our powerlessness, something like this, is our power. If you have a completely detached, disinterested, impartial body, and that's one of the problems with the Russell Tribunal, they were far from impartial, but they were pretending they were. Impartial body. Reaching a conclusion in a way that a jury does, and then walking away from it, It's very, very difficult for those who have duties to perform for which that is a relevant piece of information. It's very hard for them to disregard it. So our inability to enforce anything is really terrific. We don't want to be in charge of enforcing things. We say to people, here's a piece of information. Now, if there's something you need to do, like try and take China to the International Court of Justice, try and impose sanctions, even if it's the question of you, the purchaser, saying, my next computer will not come from the People's Republic of China. Whatever the duty is and its exemplification, they've got that material to work with. Do I think the rule of law can be dissociated from democracy, for example, a country or system that is not purely democratic, but embraces the rule of law? Well, I'm not sure. that democracy is either the necessary base for rule of law, nor that rule of law necessarily happens in every democracy. So I'm not sure that I can answer that question very simply. As to Hong Kong, with which I've also got a certain association, just as an outsider again, we've seen the most terrible deficit developing in international responsibility for Hong Kong with the enactment of that law by the People's Republic of China because people who were speaking freely, no longer speak freely, the press has been closed, people are leaving the island, and no one, no one, in the Western world, world is really saying out loud that democracy is so important that we will rush to the defence in any way possible of Hong Kong. We've abandoned Hong Kong. Presumably Hong Kong will just return to China. And as people age, the older ones will either stay there and put up with it or they'll leave and come to England or somewhere else. I'm not sure that I've answered the question in the way Mr. Anonymous or Ms. Anonymous or Mrs. Anonymous attendee wanted, but it's the best that I can do for the time being. Do you think that there is a necessary, singular necessary base to the rule of law? No, I don't see any reason why in theory, the benevolent or kindly or proper figure of authority should also impose the rule of law and ensure that it operates throughout her or his kingdom. Why not? Well, it's perfectly all right. And don't forget, if you look at communist countries or soft communist countries, going back to the former Yugosavia, which was a sort of slight halfway house, they were both authoritarian, but they would not accept for one minute that they didn't have many features of the rule of law, and many of them probably operated as well as or better than ours. And it's very silly to look at a country, like, for example, the PRC, and because of something that happens or something that's proved to happen, I think that it doesn't have representational processes working right the way down to the village group. Now, it may be in Xinjiang, those things have been operating rather badly at the local level. But elsewhere, they're the same sort of processes dealing with welfare, school, education, all the other things that have to be dealt with. And they are to some extent, I have no doubt they would say, the matter of a democratic, democracy in action because it gets lots of people involved. It's by the Communist Party, but there are. It's another way of running things. Thank you. We have another anonymous attendee who asks, are you concerned about the risk that having independently declared the Uyghur crisis to be a genocide, governments and publics will consider the matter dealt with and perversely end up doing less about this issue? If not, what do you hope the governments will do with your tribunal's findings? Thank you for that question and it raises a critical issue. I won't answer it by saying I hope for something. I would just because that would immediately turn me into something of an activist. I will, however, say what I think could be done. The problem lies in Article 1 of the Convention, in short form known as the Genocide Convention, which requires countries to act. I'll just get the terms for you. I've got them here, actually. The contracting parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish. So that the second that a government determines that genocide has occurred, by whatever measure, it has to do something relating to that genocide to prevent or punish it. And therefore, countries such as ours will go to almost any length to avoid ever saying that another country is committing genocide. Our country, for example, signed the convention but didn't ratify it for 20 or 30 years, didn't want it, didn't want it at the time, despite the fact that it came about immediately after the Second World War and was in a sense responsive to the horrors of the Holocaust of the Jews. Britain didn't want the convention. Neither did America, neither did China. They all put off ratifying it, but eventually they did. Having ratified it, in our case, there was a accession, I'm not sure it doesn't matter. It's the same thing. The British governments, and it's all governments, not just conservative governments, all governments have avoided using the word and sometimes emphatically refused to use the word. The Foreign Secretary heard at the time of both Rwanda and Yugoslavia was in fact. that the word should never be used because if the word was used and applied by a government, then they'd have to take more action than they wanted to take. In the case of the Uyghurs, we've seen this problem manifest in discussions in the House of Commons and the House of Lords right through last year and the year before in respect of a trade bill. It was really unconnected to the Uyghurs, but the whole discussion was converted to a discussion about the Uyghurs. And the government went through every imaginable step. to avoid using the word. And it eventually said this without any basis for saying it. Only a judge can decide whether genocide has occurred. However, it said that, knowing that there was no way in which a judge could ever be engaged in order to decide whether genocide was occurring, because there's no court mechanism where by that can be tested. And it's an absurd position to have taken. and they're taking it because they don't want to have to comply with the genocide convention. And the last point on this is that in respect to the Uyghurs, rather curiously, one country and one country only has pronounced that it was genocide, and that's the United States of America. Lots of countries, parliaments have said it is, but that's nothing, only one government. And that was outgoing Secretary of State Pompeo at the beginning of last year, and so that could be disregarded as maybe a bit of political something. But in fact, Blinken, the incoming Secretary of State, Biden's Secretary of State, said the same thing. Our tribunal wanted to know the basis of one which they'd said it, both the evidence and the argument. They refused to provide that. They just simply said it, and they've done nothing connected to the genocide convention to which they are committed to show that they're going to act in pursuit of their own statement. Very curious. Dodgy world can't rely really on too many things, can you? How much did the possible outcomes and the responses of each government or country play on your mind whilst you were undertaking the tribunal and then writing the report? Not at all. if you get involved in this sort of stuff, I suppose, in any way, you either do it with a blank sheet of paper and you just write what you find or don't do something else altogether. You really can't be affected by external forces. And obviously China said all sorts of beastly things about us. we invited them to cooperate at every available moment and they didn't. You'll find in the judgment we're highly encouraging of China. We're not completely negative about China at all. But we weren't wired by them. Sorry. Petra asks, how could the functioning of the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have been improved? And what could it have been done for it to not last as long? Petra, I really like your question. I see your Stoenich, so I'm not sure where you're from, but it's probably from part of it. Or possibly from part of it. Your name is Stoenich, you're selling. When I first went there, I found myself in not only an adversarial system, but quite an old-fashioned version, sort of American version of the adversarial system. And I was able then to draw on modern practices of the United Kingdom and to try and make things go a lot faster. It's quite difficult. And the successes I had took years to achieve. Just to give you a simple example, in the very first trial I did, I had senior American counsels my juniors. And they still thought evidence should be adduced without giving any notice to the defendants of what was coming. Well, England are well past that stage. And so I had to force the issue of providing a note of the evidence and then the witness statement. Of course, in England, it's gone much, much further than that. Witness statements are served. And if there's no reason to challenge them, they're just read into the record so that you get through the evidence that much more quickly. But that took a long time to get through in the ICTY. But one of the things I really, two things I favored, and neither succeeded. one was something which I did borrow from the sort of borrowed from the inquisitorial system of law, the other system of law, which was to say to the judges, look, you're asking us to call a whole bunch of evidence about, say, this village, a particular village. We don't know how much is going to be sufficient because you're not going to tell us to prove the matter. How can we do this more efficiency? Why don't we just give you a whole dossier, we said, all the printed material. that you would want that we've got about this village. Go away, you judges, read it and tell us what you need to hear about. And they liked the idea and did nothing about it. But that was one way in which you might have made progress by drawing on the other legal systems. The other thing that I said to the judges, I don't think I said it in public, although I certainly said it to a friend of mine. One of the judges is a good friend of mine and works together with us now on other things. The judges worked sort of half, half days. That wasn't the fault of them. That was because there were only three courtrooms. And so you only ever had half a day if you had to get two cases per courtroom going every day. But I also said to them, well, look, why don't you just give up your robes and all the panoply of being a judge? and you've got to make arrangements for the defendant either to be with you which won't be possible or to join you by video link and I was proposing this even 20 years ago and go down to Bosnia or Croatia wherever else it might be and sit in the equivalent of the local village hill hall I think they're called codidoms and then just work between 10 and 12 or 10 and 4 get stuck in at 8 in the morning in your suit in the grabby place that it will be hear the evidence sit through to 9 o'clock at the time night and do that five days a week and get on with it. Now, that would not only have shortened the case, but it would also have given the local residents of whichever part of the territory, it might have been the opportunity of seeing justice in action and seeing that the judges were really concerned to get a feel both of the place as well as for the evidence. Another of my ideas that I'm afraid fell on stony ground, but Petra, thank you very much for asking the question because it gives you a chance to say that. Thank you, Petra. Our graduate officer, Isra, asks, would you say that there are bigger problems with the international criminal justice system besides it being adversarial? And he suggests the main one might be the disparity in double standard between the powerful and the weak states. Certainly, Is there a car, and you'll write about that. The adversarial system is only one small issue about which one could take issue, and who knows, it might still work to be the best one if it was ever qualitatively assessed. Yes, it looked for a long time as though the International Criminal Court, which followed the Uyghist R Tribunal and is a sort of permanent body, although it's not at all universal, because only a small number of countries assigned up to it, was going to be an African-only court. There are some reasons, some good reasons, why so many African cases, or more African cases than others were taken there. But has the court shown really any appetite for dealing with the difficult customers, Israel? No, Israel's got a very powerful patron in the form of the United States. And any of the other hot but difficult countries, no. Now, the prosecutors, the first two prosecutors at the ICC, the first one, Der Campo, was... widely regarded is very unsuccessful. The second one from Afghur was possibly considerably better. We've now got a new one who happens to be British. I have no idea what political pressures are placed on them. And whereas from outside when you think, oh, gosh, I could do that job so much better than they could, you actually don't know what the realities are within the office and what the political pressures may come to. But so the question is there are certainly bigger problems and the disparity between powerful and weak states is very clearly effective. And it must be reversed. When it comes to something like Assad and the USA, I don't know enough about the present position on either of those, but yes, going back to something about which I did know something, when the NATO bombing of Belgrade was brought as an initial. issue before the ICTY, that very quickly got a report that said not enough evidence, and one was bound to ask really whether that was a fair report or a politically effective report. And I'm sure the matters that Isra Khan raises are quite easily subject to the same pressure. But the person of you might be to get to talk to would be Karim Khan, who I know very well, who was the present prosecutor at the International Criminal Court. He might be quite interesting on this. Thank you, Isra. We have another anonymous attendee who asks, how closely do you think the UK court should follow the Strasbourg jurisprudence? Very. The Strasbourg jurisprudence is jurisprudence to which we should indeed be committed. People often misunderstand or indeed even politicians that Europe has various manifestations in the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights are entirely different from the European Union and everything to do with it. We signed up to that after the Second World War and so far as I am concerned it is infinitely better to have more great minds thinking on particular problems than just our own. And so yes, we should follow the Strasbourg laws. No reason not, it's just a political, it's a reflection of the same Brexit nonsense about sovereignty that says it's better to do it all on your own. Sometimes I raise this as a sort of silly question. If you had a really serious medical problem, There's two hospitals. It's a hospital over here, which really does look at all the English literature on your particular condition and really knows all the English literature about how to cure you. And there's another hospital here which has all the English literature, but it also has all the European literature, all the European wisdom. Which one would you go to? Which one would you go to, Geoffrey? I'd go to the European one. I'd rather have all the knowledge, all the wisdom, and just a bit of it. Inigo asks us, the issue's been discussed. Human rights, democracy, the rule of law and judicial independence are brought together in the Hong Kong court of final appeal. That court has a number of foreign judges, including a number of also active or formally active in the UK, among them Jonathan Sumpion. Do you not share his view, or do you share his view, but there is no reason he and others should not sit on that court, even after the week of tribunals, conclusion and the new security law in Hong Kong. I run a series of, or help run a series of lectures at the Inner Temple called Social Context of Law, which are aimed at ensuring that high-level lawyers are available, not just to students and practitioners and judges to discuss big issues, but also to the public. And one of those was on exactly this issue, I think, some time ago. and or this was part of the issue. And we had Lord Faulkner and, you know, come to me a minute, taking opposing sides. My instincts were firmly in favour of saying, no, the judges shouldn't go there for any reason. By the time I'd heard the discussion through, I think I was probably persuaded that there was just about one reason for their staying on and that reason was for as long as the local practitioners thought their presence there might help and for no other reason than that. And if it's the case, as appeared to be the case, that in what must be a dire position for local Hong Kong lawyers, the local lawyers think that the visiting judges may do some good, well, I suppose they might just about stay there. But it's very hard to see how they can do any good when people are whipped off back to China to be tried and imprisoned. and when the sort of cases that are of our concern, criminal cases of that kind, or what's happening to the newspapers and so on, are simply not going to find their way to the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong. So I suspect, even if I wasn't persuaded at the time of this discussion a couple of year ago or so, maybe a bit longer, that the right thing to do would be to abandon ship. I think probably the time is fast approaching. as the Jonathan Sumption doesn't particularly surprise me that he would like to take a contrary review. I don't agree with it necessarily. Unfortunately, we're running out of time for more questions. I'd like to use my privilege as the chair to ask one final question, which is if you could have our members think about one thing this week, something that you think is important that's coming up or something that you've learned in your time and your career, what would that be? Well, thank you for giving me that freedom. I see it's five to six, four minutes to six. I'll go back to how I started Molly or Madam President. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to call you in a formal setting. It's the way we look at the law that I think is quite important for us all. And if you look at international law or the law of war, you need to see it in an arc. And the arc starts after the end of the two centuries of sovereignty, started with the Treaty of Westphalia and Gloria's Revolution. So at the beginning of the 18th century, 1700s, 1800s, the arc doesn't start until the end of then. When you start regulating war and you go through the First World War, the Second World War, the Nuremberg trials, the Yugoslav trial, the permanent international criminal court. And then what you're finding is an internationalism where people recognize that there was value in order to stop people killing each other in trying to do that which had been so much desired at the time of the turn of the 19th, 20th centuries by many idealists and just deal with things by arbitration. But with things like Brexit and with things like the outpourings of Trump and his then security advisor or defense secretary, Bolton, who want to see the death of the international criminal court and of all international criminal processes and want to go back to the position where what you do within your own territory is never for supervision by other human beings. We are in a dangerous prospect. In my view, the arc is coming to the end and going down. And what I would like everyone to consider is this, and it's my last point. Universal human rights declared in 1948 and manifest in other things like the genocide convention. They are rights matched by duties. Your right is my duty, whoever you are and wherever you are. and we need to get across that these things are not just to be mediated by countries and governments that, for example, have here today, gone tomorrow policies on sovereignty. They remain the duty of the citizen. To be manifested, however the citizen can, either through government, by what is elected into office or put into office, by what you buy, if you don't like what another country is doing, by what you protest about or by the civil society actions that you take. And the Uyghur Tribunal, for example, is really a civil society action. All of this can be seen within this arc of rising and falling internationalism as the citizen recognizing that he has a duty to perform, she or he has a duty to perform if universal rights of others. are as they must be respected, honoured, guaranteed, preserved. So, Geoffrey, thank you so much for joining us this evening. And thank you to our members who've been on the Zoom call. Do join us for our first in-person event tomorrow at 5pm with Simon Jordan, Talksport, co-host and entrepreneur, or join us online at 8pm for an event with Professor Akil Amar, a constitutional law scholar. So, Jeffrey, thank you very much. you all have a lovely evening. Thank you very much.
