 Hello everyone, and thank you so much for that wonderful applause as an introduction. So before I begin, I was going to do a very long and drawn out rebuttal to the opposition, but they were all really wonderful speeches. I feel that would just be unfair. However, there's one person I really want to address in this room, and that is Maya, question mark, question mark, question mark. So for those of you who don't know me, Yes, I am a huge watch fanatic, I must admit, but I became even more of one as her speech droned on, and I said it more and more. Now, I... But it was a wonderful speech, so thank you to the GLO. So before I begin this speech, I just wanted to take a moment to thank the President, not just for hosting this fascinating debate and for giving me the immense privilege of speaking in it. And I also want to thank the remarkable people who have traveled to the Union to speak here tonight, and whom it has been an absolute pleasure and a privilege to hear from. One thing that if you want to know something about me, I've been thinking about this moment since I was about eight years old. It really is an honor. So as the penultimate speaker of this debate, I feel I ought to remind everyone why your vote here matters. Though when I first heard the motion, I imagined, perhaps, as many of you did, that this is really a topic that's only pertinent to the Armshire academic, your class. classic Oxford professor, but the future does not appear out of nowhere. It is informed by the past and dictated by present action. Eleanor Messini perhaps said it best that visions make it possible to create a future that is different from the present, although its seeds are found in the present. The motion is this House believes that the future is post-gender, and I urge you to consider the phrasing carefully. Tonight we are considering the future, so side-propositions, wins your vote as you walk through those doors, if you can envision a future where, as a society, we have transcended the clumsy contemporary ideas of gender, not tomorrow, not next year, not in a generation, but in the future, after decades of cultural and societal evolution. Before I prove, alongside the fine arguments from the speakers to my left, that the future is post-gender, it is important to say that debating gender, sexuality and identity is not and has never been an excuse for regressive and repulsive transphobia. When arguing that the future is post-gender, we do not make crude arguments for biological essentialism. Rather, we see a future where people are freed from the contemporary Western ideas of gender and instead seek a future where people are free to self-actualize and live their best lives with their most fulfilled identities. So the first point I'd like to touch on is the fact that all the great advances of human history have been defined by their ability to improve our lives through overcoming biological restrictions. Each invention has determined a new choice for me to define who I am, how I live, and what makes up and constitutes my reality. While biologically I cannot run 60 miles per hour, modern cars certainly can. While I cannot saw hundreds of miles above the air, planes can do so instead. While I cannot talk to girls in real life, Tinder does it for me. The reason modern technology has become such a crucial part of modern life is that it allows us to transcend our biological limitations. The same can be said for hormone replacement therapy, puberty blockers, and gender-affirming surgery. Past impossibilities, but present tools at our disposal to make life better for those who choose to use them. With every passing day, the few STEM students who have made it here to this chamber tonight, and are procrastinating the 10th problem sheet of the week, are creating a better world. But with each technological development, we blur the lines between what is biological fact and authentic future. With the advancement towards gender becoming solely optional now, the meaning behind the strict divisions between genders are becoming more translucent. It seems only logical that the next step is the removal of any restriction altogether and allowed for completely unlimited self-expression. It is crucial to note that our side of the debate is not necessarily arguing for a world in which gender as a whole is abolished tomorrow. I'm sure that every person standing at this podium has always chosen their gender with care and the representation with care, and it is one of the few ways we have available to us to change the fundamental realities of how everyone else views us. Not only do we choose our pronouns or gender title or choose how we express different aspects of those gender expectations through our outweigh, word appearance, it is all part of the composition of who we are. It is clear that gender has given us the gift of self-selection from existing choices, in fact, until recently just two options of self-selection. However, by eradicating the suffocatingly limited parameters of man or woman, we allow, or any other gender for that matter, we allow for a more rich and diverse existence where we can choose who we are independently of assigned sex. By going above and between those two and many categories of gender, we allow for everyone to have the power of self-creation rather than just self-selection. When we now ask the question, what is a woman? Any layman like me struggles for an answer, and any academic in the field, even more so. The biology underlying the question hasn't changed since the birth of the first Homo sapien, but the societal ramifications of those realities most certainly have. However, one describes the stereotypical man as strong, assertive, competitive, and inevitably leads to the implication that women or any other gender are not that. After all, definitions are intended to distinguish something from something else to identify it, and feminists would rightly respond, are women also not strong, assertive and competitive? Can women not be everything a man can be? And what about men who are not strong, assertive, and competitive? And the inverse phenomenon would happen if an attempt was made to describe women. Hence we ask the noxious idea that we can associate a positive set of behavioral characteristics with a physical sex is intrinsically flawed. The very definitions of gender have very little and ever less logical founding. The power of expectations would still very much remain in a genderless world, but these would be the expectations we set on ourselves rather than a glass ceiling keeping us in line. Whether you identify a socially right or left in political terms, it seems that every notch on the political spectrum has realized the total futility of using gendered language. We are beginning to see the lack of utility in many of the stratifications gender is used for. For instance, in many romance languages, the addition of gendered to material objects seems to serve no material purpose. Whilst the term La Table might appear ordinary to the average francophile, and I cannot speak for anyone in this chamber, but I've never personally witnessed a table so completely voluptuous and architectically beautiful that I just had to refer to it as la table. However, this is what French suggests that we think in baguette country. However, the French Academy has itself recognized the changing times and has now adopted the gender-neutral pronoun to accommodate these realities with the term Yel. When the most fundamental building blocks of reality are being adapted in this way, the possibility of a post-gender future seems like less of a possibility and more of a certainty. Perhaps in a post-gender future, the terms masculine and feminine will melt away into a relic of ancient dialogue, or perhaps they will maintain their use as adjectives. But what is almost certain is that they will cease to have the same connotations they have now, just as their meanings have evolved since they were born almost a millennium ago. Indeed, whenever we refer to these two genders, we typically speak of the gender divide, the pay gap. These are forms of language which seek to divide all. It is separations between individuals. It serves no other function than to categorize and then by definition divide us, especially for the fact that the word vagina in French is in the masculine, which frankly has divided me since I read it in a GCSE textbook. It has been said by far better people than I, in far more eloquent ways, that the goal of Western ethical history is to remove the stigmas that separate us and others so that the content of the character is all that remains to be judged. On our side of the House, we propose exactly that reality. And if you're so inclined, I urge you to vote side proposition. Thank you.
