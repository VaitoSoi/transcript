 Good evening, members, and thank you, Mr. President, for this opportunity to speak. Now, the topic of Scottish independence remains a constantly disputed idea, and one which has been resurfacing most frequently over the last decade, but whose history can be dated as far back as the 1930s. In recent times, the likes of Alex Salmon and, Nicola Sturgeon, until very recently, have assumed the burden of pioneering Scottish independence. Yet this has been repelled by unionist leaders such as Boris Johnson, who claimed that the 2014 referendum was a once-in-a-generation opportunity. How wonderfully ironic that the issue of Scottish independence seems to be the one time that Boris rejects a party proposal. No, thank you. especially one about the restrictions of the UK government. Now, the Scottish referendum in 2014 was rejected by a margin of 10.6 percentage points. However, we stand nearly 10 years on from that moment of democratic self-expression, and a great deal has changed in our national and political landscapes. In particular, the Scottish National Party has decisively won their fourth consecutive term in government, with some of their key policies being to hold another independence referendum. On a democratic level, whilst polling is volatile, it is apparent that there is a growing support for pro-independence and a substantive, consistent majority are now in favour. Therefore, there seems to be no moral justification for the UK government to obstruct the right of the people in Scotland to determine their own future. But before I get into why independence is the way for, it falls upon me to introduce the opposition speakers before the House this evening. Speaking first, we have Finley Armstrong, a second-year theology student from Regents Park College. Now, reliable sources tell me that Finley sought to achieve a type of B-Nock status and attention in setting up the Oxford Hummus Society. But I hope tonight the pro-union arguments of this famous Shetland Islander are somewhat less pointless, bizarre, or random than his hummus appreciation society. Next up is Alex Cole Hamilton. He has been the leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats since 2021 and a member of the Scottish Parliament since 2016. In the most recent Scottish Parliament election, Alec received the highest number of votes ever cast for a single candidate, beating his runner-up S&P candidate by almost 10,000 votes. He's clearly a well-established politician, although having previously scrolled through his Twitter feed, I was debating whether he may actually be a keen of Scottish rugby fan than a Scottish politician. And finally, to conclude the opposition tonight, we have the right Honourable Carwin Jones. He is a former First Minister of Wales and leader of the Welsh Labour Party, serving from 2009 to 2018, a clearly very decorated and experienced politician, and I'm sure that he will bring an incredibly valuable perspective to this debate. These, Mr. President, are your speakers and they are most welcome. Now, returning to the topic at hand, I want to start by focusing on what independence really means. This term is closely synonymous with the notion of self-determination. This is a right of a people to be. control their own future. It allows people to choose their own political status, to determine their own form of economic, cultural and social development. Who better to look out for Scotland's needs than a local government with all the governing power at a country level? No, thank you. Whilst there have been modest efforts to appease this notion through devolution, it is simply not enough. The imposed devolution system has proved of late to be utterly in effect. and even harmful towards Scotland. Since 2016, decisions taken by the UK government have highlighted the inherent vulnerability of the devolved institutions within the UK's constitutional system. The most prominent case of this, of course, is the EU referendum. This clearly showcases the political disparity between Scotland and England, with Scotland having a majority 62% of voters voting to remain compared to England's 46. As a compromise for this, the governments had initially agreed to a process that committed them to work together in EU negotiations. And in theory, this would have provided an opportunity for the views of the Scottish electorate to be taken into account, and even for a potential compromise proposal by the Scottish government to take effect for mitigating the risks of leaving the EU. However, in practice, there was little discussion between the governments, and no meaningful opportunity for the Scottish government to influence the UK negotiating position. The former Brexit that was taken was very different to the compromise proposal and reflected solely the views of the UK government. Scotland has been continuously disregarded in matters that have great consequence towards them. In fact, since then, it has grown even worse, with Brexit being used as the context for several pieces of Westminster legislation being passed that placed new constraints on the power of the Scottish government. and this was done despite the refusal of consent by Scotland. This had a hugely adverse effect on devolution as it required Scotland to effectively accept standards for goods and services set elsewhere in the UK. Devolution has been constantly undermined by the UK government who have in effect limited the ability of the Scottish Parliament to make decisions and laws that affect Scotland. And this trend also appears set to continue and even increase, as will the UK government imposing their views on devolved areas against the wishes of Scotland. An independent nation would be able to grasp full control and prioritise itself in the plethora of matters that the current state of devolution just does not allow. The SMP late last year even attempted to fight back on this when they argued with the Supreme Court in order to gain some form of clarity as to how they could interpret their laws. they claimed that where there are two possible readings of statutory provisions, one which is compatible with international law and one which is not, the former, should be preferred. Now this would grant Scotland the freedom to decide how domestic legislations affect them and in effect give them the control that they want. Yet the court quickly dismissed the duality of interpretation that the party proposed. They replied that international law does not apply to the law. them in any way since Scotland is not a colony or an oppressed territory. The court is held under the illusion that they are not disadvantaging Scotland by keeping them in this union. However, this is simply not true. As well as the freedom of choice that Scotland is seeking, their independence would also grant them a release from the burdens that the UK imposes. The North Sea tax is the biggest example of this. The oil and gas production in 2022 reached the highest level recorded in over a decade. And if Scotland were able to take full advantage of these oil and gas revenues, it would greatly strengthen their fiscal position. Currently, companies operating in the North Sea pay three different taxes, all of which go to the UK government and pulled out the distribution across the UK. This is despite 82% of production taking place in Scottish waters. The money accrued if Scotland were able to make full use of these revenues would greatly aid the growth their economy. And moreover, it would aid, the control that they would get would aid the switch between going from a non-renewable to a renewable source of energy. This was shown in 2016, when the Scottish National Party established the Sustainable Growth Commission. This was to recommend certain policies for an independent Scotland. In this, they considered how the North Sea tax revenues would be received as a fiscal bonus and not relied on for fiscal management. They even continued that these revenues would be set aside for a fund for future generations to invest in Scottish infrastructure and a green economy amongst other things. Now speaking of future generations, the support of the independence among those aged 16 to 34 has reached almost 3 in 4, booming in popularity since the 2014 stats. And a large reason for this is the political disunity that the youth feel. They don't back the government. Seeing how, how the UK government has failed with the likes of Brexit, COVID and even the political administration, many Scots are asking themselves, what can the government really offer Scotland? They didn't vote for austerity, but have felt and continue to feel the effects of it. They didn't vote for the Conservative government, but still have to endure their jurisdiction. And the consequence of this has been recently showcased when Westminster moved to block the gender bill proposed by Parliament. Nicholas Sturgeon described this as a full frontal attack on the democratically elected Scottish Parliament and its ability to make its own decisions on devolved matters. The issue with the government having power over so many states is that they can never appease them all. And in their attempts to appease the most amount of people, it has taken the safe option in disregarding the bill, but in doing this it has undermined a process that has been years in the making. Now to conclude, I have covered how social Scotland's economy has many strengths and huge potential. Independence and membership of the EU can make the most for this, for the whole of Scotland. It can make a stronger, more progressive society which focuses solely on the needs of Scotland. But Scotland isn't just about the pounds and the Pence. It's about the people, those who feel that the bridge with the UK is only getting wider. They have no hatred towards the others in the Union, but have such a deep love and appreciation of their own culture, their own way of living. Scotland is a proud nation with their own customs and traditions, and they should be free to express these in the confines of their own independent nation. Scotland's destiny must remain in the hands of Scotland, and whatever the result of any referendum, any election, or any political circumstance, and there may be many of each still yet to come, let us hope that Scotland is able to maximise its potential to the fullest extent. and continue that long and ancient history, which has made it a country and a people that continues to charm, to inspire, and to impress multitudes across the globe. It is because I believe that a brighter future is still possible if Scotland makes the utmost of its destiny, that I urge you to vote for the proposition tonight. Thank you.
