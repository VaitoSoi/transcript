 With that done, without further I do, to close the case for the proposition, it means me a great honor to welcome onto the stage Michael Sullivan, author, economist and investor. President, to rejoin the debate, I can't let the sloppy work of Dr. Bragg of the United Nations go unchecked. I'll remind her that my two friends here have stated that the most deadly and most pernicious borders are invisible ones, based on nationalism, prejudice and foolish and careless policymaking. And I would abolish all of those. Secondly, thank you for the plug of the book. Everyone get down to Blackwell's tomorrow morning. I wrote a book about the end of globalization because that scenario terrifies me. And it worries me for your generation. My generation has seen globalization and all of its benefits flourish. But what is ahead is much more dark. In the book, I wrote about a worst-case scenario where we would have war, rampant inflation, high interest rates, social chaos. I never thought it would happen. And here we are today in 2002. Inflation is the highest in 50 years. And we have a major war in Europe. So, ladies and gentlemen, I am for open trade. I'm for open borders. I'm for open societies. And I'm here to warn you that all of the... are being pushed back and that your generation needs to do something about this. It all started in 1987. Ronald Reagan called upon Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall. Three or four years later communism fell. The political border between the West and the East fell, the economic border between China and the West fell. And global. globalization begun. And globalization has been a great and powerful force. And each of the three of us, I think we're at Oxford around about that time in the 1990s. And we bore witness to the first green shoots of globalization. I remember very clearly a friend gave up his law course to go and set up a chain of coffee shops. We thought it would never catch on. Some of the richer kids, bought Nokia mobile phones. Never even thought Blackberries could exist and I never thought that at the union we'd see students doing their speeches with mobile phones. We used also debate Netscape or the internet as it was called then and we thought it would never catch on. But catch on it did. And very soon Britain was called Cool Britannia and sadly it's not cool today at all in the age of Brexit. So that's what my generation saw. We lived and most people prospered with globalization. And the burden for your generation, most of you are around about the same age we were in the 1990s, and I hope you end up looking as fit and good-looking as the rest of us in 20 years' time. But the burden for your generation is to see globalization crumble. And the responsibility of your generation is to do something constructive and positive about it. And just to remind you, globalisation is unparalleled in world history. We've never had such a long period where growth has been so strong, where inflation has been so low, where billions of people have been lifted out of poverty. We've never seen such a wealth effect. In countries like Indonesia, wealth paralysis, for example has gone up by 10 times. Globalization has changed the way we communicate, the way we socialize, it's changed how we travel, it's changed what we consume, what we eat. By and large, it has been a great and positive force for most people in the world, except a few discontented countries. And the great irony is that the two countries that historically have pushed globalization, the UK and the US, are the ones that have become most discontented because they have failed to harness the benefits and to spread the benefits of globalization. In the US, wealth inequality has never, ever been so high. The gap between the pay of a CEO and a worker has never been so high, not in the 1920s and not even going back to the time of the Roman Empire. And the response to this, the dangerous response to this, has been to put up borders. It's been to build a wall with Mexico, it's been to enact a trade war with China, and it's been to build gated communities that fracture societies. No, no, sorry. In Britain, a similar foolish response, Brexit. We won't go there. I want to give you the example, however, of the most globalised countries in the world, Singapore, Switzerland, Sweden, Netherlands, etc. None of them have a problem with inequality because they all understand that even though they have old, well-established physical borders, they use things like the rule of law, democracy, shared values to allow the easy flow of trade, of people and of money. And unfortunately today, globalization or the idea of open societies and open borders has other attackers. The war in Ukraine is fracturing the world diplomatically. Very, very sadly, Hong Kong, which for me is a symbol of this borderless world, a dynamic and thriving city-state has had its democracy snuffed out with very, very little protest from, no, sorry, with very, very little protest. So there is a doubt. So there is a darkness, I'm sorry to say, and I don't use that kind of phrase lightly. There is a darkness coming. This fracturing is happening all around us of economies, of societies, arguably societies have never had, had never been so polarised. You've never had this kind of political borders within individual societies. There are many positives. The fourth industrial revolution technology, tech in particular, but the whole point of this technology is that it connects people. And if the crowd here have their way, we will never see the fourth industrial revolution. So ladies and general, what do I want you to do? I want you to do three things. Think about the role of values and of democracy in particular as an antidote to this darkness. When globalization happened, there was a flourishing of democracies, and that's now being reversed. There's now more autocracies in the world than democracies. And that's something we have to push back on, because democracy is the lifeblood of this open world and open societies. Think also about shared values. Your generation is different to ours in that you're probably on balance more cosmopolitan, more global, you're certainly more aware of identities and the interbalance of different identities. And this is very, very important because it's a value set that transcends borders. And for me, there's some very, very important markers of this. One is how women are treated. Another is how the lesbian gay community are treated. And these values cannot be different across borders. If you take the European Union, the European Union is actually, even though it has many old national borders, it is pushing these values across countries. And I dare say that countries like Hungary who don't subscribe to these will no longer be part of that value-based club. The second thing is when you hear nonsense that we should have more borders, push back. go to, you know, push back and bring some live examples. If I look at the US, Congress wasn't stormed on January 6 by hordes of Mexicans. It was by largely white middle-aged males. If you look at political violence in the States, it's not Islamic terrorists. 75% of the extreme attacks, political attacks in America, have come from the right. And the third thing you can do, given the context of this great and historic university, is go back to the history books. Because globalization has happened before. We've had globalization from 1870 to 1912. And that was a dazzling period. You had many new technologies, the steam engine, you had electric cars. You had very, very big financial markets. but that period of globalization ended badly and it ended with borders, it ended with nationalism, and it ended with a great war, and that is something to be avoided. So I'd just say that when I was here as a student, globalization was bubbling up, and we didn't quite know what was coming next, and we weren't sure that it wouldn't catch on. And all I will say to you is don't let this narrow-minded view that we need more walls, we need more borders and we need more barriers to catch on. Thank you Mr. President.
