 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. for joining me and joining us this afternoon. I guess I'd like to start by allowing you each the opportunity to make some opening remarks. I think that falls to me. Thank you. So in the United States, a red, blue fault line runs across America. So red is conservative, blue as progressive. Nowhere, and on no topic, is this more true than around abortion. So in the leaked opinion and Dobbs, if it becomes law, 26 states of our 50 are poised to restrict abortion in ways that many would have thought unimaginable years ago. I teach in Illinois, a blue state. One might think that Dobbs is really none of our concern, but that would be wrong. The Midwest looks like a donut, it's blue in the middle, and red all around the outside. So purple states to our north like Wisconsin and Michigan who are seen as sort of middle ground middle road states they touch our borders but on the question of abortion they are red their bans on abortion that were put in place contemporaneous with Roe v. Wade were never removed and they will spring up if Dobbs in turn becomes law our neighboring states like Indiana Kentucky Missouri and Iowa have introduced a steady drumming beat of anti-abortion bills across the last half century since Roe v. Wade. Indiana alone has enacted 55 different abortion restrictions in the last decade. Iowa, Missouri, and Kentucky have some of the most restrictive laws in America, disallowing abortion after six weeks, eight weeks, before a person might even know that they're pregnant. Now Missouri's law is instructive of what is to come. It regulates, quote, abortion to the full extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States, the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and federal statutes. It allows abortion only in cases of medical emergency. So our little blue island in this Red Sea will overnight become a destination for abortion in the Midwest. We are the nearest state providing abortion for an estimated 8.9 to 10 million winning. of reproductive age. Now not all will seek abortion. But if you project from CDC estimates of abortion rates, that means another 102,000 women are predicted to seek abortion within Illinois. In 2020, Illinois did 46,000 in some number of abortions. So this means that Illinois abortion providers will likely face three times as many abortion requests and have to grapple with that as the year before. Our 40 facilities cannot possibly sustain that demand. Now Illinois, women in particular might think we're going to come first, but that ironically may not be constitutional. So in Doe v. Bolton, which was a companion case to Roe v. Wade, Georgia required that abortion patients be Georgia residents, and the Supreme Court struck down that rule. On the settled ground, that the Constitution prohibits the states from limiting general medical care within their borders to their own residents. So that principle holds regardless of what happens with Roe or Dobbs. Now, the court in Bolton did note that there was no evidence that Georgia providers were operating at capacity, but Illinois may soon test that case and back that question. Forcing courts, I think, to revisit a whole set of questions after Dobbs that we haven't thought about for a half decade. I mean, half of a hundred years. So as demand builds in Illinois, it's going to carry risk for Illinois providers. A wave of states are now using novel means to enforce their laws. So from Texas's sort of famous, infamous bounty law that allows a person, a private citizen to sue for somebody else who is, quote, aided or a abetted an abortion in Texas, to tougher laws on the use of pills to end a pregnancy, to long-arm statutes that use a connection to the state to enforce the state's laws against its residents, even when those residents have gone out of state. For example, that a pregnant woman was in state when she made the telephone call for an abortion procedure out of state. Now, doctors say that they fear, this onslaught of lawsuits. Now that's just descriptive at this point. Real question, I think, for us is what do you do in a climate like this? And I believe that we need to look to our experience, our recent experience with same-sex marriage and gay rights when these questions were resolved in state houses and not courts. So I've spent most of my career in the culture war, marrying what many people think are rights that compete with each other in the same law. So, for example, the freedom of churches to continue to abide by their convictions on same-sex law with the rights of all couples to have the access to marriage that they need for the protections of their families. Now, that's a concrete way in which things can be married. Those laws were nuanced, and they made good faith attempts to take into account all the interest implicated. If Dobbs stands as drafted, we will soon be thrown back into statehouses to make a specific case for the specific needs of women. To abortion, for example, for reasons of incest and rape, to protect a woman's physical health or her mental health or for fetal abnormality. Now, these state houses will be led by Republicans. courts by their nature give complete wins and complete losses. State houses do not. A good compromise is often one that nobody loves, not a single person. A good compromise gives most sides something like 80%. No one gets 100%. Now what does that mean here? I think our arguments and tactics have to shift. Last night you may have seen, that a pregnancy clinic was firebond. You may know that we have handmaidens, people dressed as handmaidens, standing outside the homes of Supreme Court justices, because people are outraged. I think we'll hear some of the outrage today. But those tactics, I believe, backfire. State lawmakers read papers. They watch the news. And these tactics, I fear, will harden them against the very sympathetic cases that do have to be made for protections that people do need. So that's one big fear. I think what we need to do is to take a page from the success around same-sex marriage and to humanize the needs that we are asking lawmakers to instantiate into positive law. Lawmakers have daughters, sisters, mothers wives, many, but too few, are women themselves. So I think there are receptive ears for claims. Now, what were the fights be? This is the part I've been struggling with in the last few days. I actually think the Gallup polling can guide us here. So, for example, rape. Second, only to life of the mother is support for an exception to abortion laws for rape. 77% in 2018 said that. That number has been consistent for decades. But we can already see lines drawing. Seven of the 26 states that are in play, if Dobbs holds, already have rape exceptions, but they include restrictions that are shocking to our modern ears. Georgia, for example, says an abortion could happen in the first 20 weeks if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, and an official police report has been filed. Arkansas requires documentation, of filing with law enforcement. Missouri requires a formal charge. In South Carolina, by contrast, a doctor can do an abortion before 20 weeks and after the fact they have to report to the local sheriff a rape allegation. Now, if they don't, there's a big fine and they may go to jail. But at the very least, the procedure could be had before there was a filing of a charge. Now, we know that we know that that very few people report rape. Only 20% of female college students who report ever having been raped, reported it in fact to authorities. Now I think the fact that charges will have to be filed will mean that abortion access will suddenly become a deeply personal issue to men in a way that it has not in the past. Second, mental health, my last point. Every state makes an exception for the life of the mother, 21 make provision for the woman's health, but they are tightly policing mental health. A New York Times op-ed this weekend described the moral quandary, faced by psychotherapist pre-Roe, who often felt compelled to say a woman's mental health was at stake. One doctor in the paper remarked that she felt compromised at the outset. Now states know this, and they're already blocking that move. Tennessee's law says, for example, that abortion is allowed to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman. But it goes on to say that pregnant women, it will not matter, and it cannot count if a pregnant woman will engage in conduct that would self-harm in order to satisfy that test. And neither does it count in any way if the risk is related to, quote, a woman's mental health. Six other states almost identically parrot that framing. The states are copying each other. Now we saw that in same-sex marriage too. It is really, really important to turn that tide. The single best thing that can be done at this moment in time in state houses in this climate is to work on a competing approach that can be copied across the nation, a kinder alternative. South Carolina, again, as one example, allows abortion when necessary and, quote, the best medical judgment of the attending physician and a consulting doctor to, quote, preserve the health of the woman. They allow mental health. But when they do, an independent consulting psychiatrist, someone who is not in practice with the attending physician, has to sign off. Now, that process has more process. But it doesn't erect the kind of substantive hurdles that the test about self-sufficiency. harm erects. And so it may be more flexible in practice and this is the last point. So I don't know what precise formulations these Republicans in the 26 states are going to come up with, although I spent most of my career talking to Republicans. But I do know one thing is certain. People will have to make a case for their needs. Appealing to our common humanity and not billifying others who have different views is more likely to succeed than a asserting rights. For better or worse, Dobbs, if unchanged, will require us to act again as one people, a single people. In polarized America, that's almost laughable. We are not good at that anymore, but we will have to be. And so it's going to be very messy. Thank you. don't yet know what the final decision will be, but I'll take it as a presumption that something like Justice Alito's draft opinion, at least in its core holding, will be the new law, constitutional law on abortion in the United States. So I'm going to structure my remarks today as a brief commentary on three points that are at the conclusion of Justice Alito's draft opinion in Dobbs. The first one is this. Justice Alito says that abortion presents a profound moral question. And I believe that's implicit in my colleague's remarks that we just heard. There are indeed many moral questions raised by abortion, and some of these call for philosophical self-reflection. When did my life begin? When did I become a human being whose life is deserving of legal protection? When did I become a person with rights? Peter Singer, the Princeton moral philosopher, believes that one obtains personhood, which is tied to the capacity for self-consciousness around the age of two. Until then, he argues, infanticide should be permissible in some cases. I think this possession should be, position should be rejected at the outset. That then raises the question of where do we draw the line? The pro-life side generally holds that it is conception. Some on the pro-choice side hold that the line is birth. Roe v. Wade itself drew a line of sorts at the point of viability, that is the ability to survive outside the womb. It was only after this point that Roe permitted states to ban abortion. The answer you give to this question of where to draw the line has profound moral consequences as well as implications for legal regulation and how you understand the right to life vis-a-vis unborn human beings. Abortion presents profound moral questions for a woman facing an unwanted pregnancy, and society's obligations toward her. My view is that the state has a solemn obligation to provide material support for women in such a situation and I think it is an unfortunate consequence of the Roe decision that it has obscured this issue. The second point Jessel Salito stated is that the Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each state from regulating or prohibiting abortion and I submit that the Dobbs opinion makes a compelling case for this conclusion. The principal point in the opinion is that the original opinion in Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided as a matter of constitutional law. There is no specified right to abortion in the U.S. Constitution. Roe claimed that the right could be inferred from a generalized right to privacy, but it notably failed to specify any specific textual or doctrinal basis for the conclusion, and even claimed that there was no need to provide such basis. I think this is an improper way to decide a constitutional case. And it has led many scholars who support the right to abortion as a political matter to reject Roe v. Wade as constitutional law. Some of these scholars are set out in the Dobbs' opinion itself. The decision in Roe can be contrasted to a decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court in 1975 about the same time, which I believe takes much more seriously the profound moral questions that I mentioned at the start. And among other things, the court insisted on the obligation of the state to provide support for a woman who chooses to bear a child in the face of poverty or need. Justice Alita's third and final point that I'll comment on is that Roe and Casey arrogated the authority to decide these matters to the court itself. We now overrule those decisions and return that authority to the people and their elected representatives. The effective Dobbs will be to put the regulation of abortion in the United States on something more like a footing like that in Europe. And I should say in respect to my colleagues remarks that one difference is that in Europe many of these issues are now settled and now in the United States there will be very difficult debates and and discussions and deliberations and deliberations about these matters. But in the sense that the footing is more like that of Europe now, I'll just say this. The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly been asked to declare that there is a human right to abortion applicable in all member states, but it has consistently declined to do so. And as a result, the nations of Europe are free to decide for themselves democratically how to regulate abortion. And it's true that the United States is a nation-state in a way that Europe is not. But it's also true that these matters of regulation were from the start of the Republic until Roe v. Wade state matters and not matters of national regulation or law. So it's noteworthy in this respect that most European states have more restrictive laws regarding access to abortion than many states in the US. Of course, there are exceptions, and some of them were mentioned earlier. But in France and Germany, for example, the gestational limit for abortion is 12 weeks. By contrast, the Mississippi law at issue in Dodds itself does not provide a general prohibition on abortion until after 15 weeks. So the law at issue in Dobbs is more permissive than the law in France or Germany. If Roe v. Wade applied in Europe, the laws of most nations would have been unconstitutional, and the people of those nations would be denied the right to deliberate and decide these issues for themselves. So my remarks have been mainly about the profound moral questions at issue and the question of who should decide. And I think that for all the difficulties that are coming, I think that is in terms of the overall political and constitutional setting of this, it's good that people will be able to decide these issues democratically, hopefully through careful and respectful deliberation. Thank you. Thank you. So I'm a scholar of American anti-discrimination law, law, particularly with respect to gender and sexuality. And I'd like to say a few words about what the leaked Dobbs draft means in terms of gender equality in the U.S. Constitution. And I have to admit, I'm pretty depressed about this as a progressive and a feminist. So by way of background, as a result of amendments after the U.S. Civil War, the U.S. Constitution guarantees that the equal protection of the laws. In the middle of the 20th century, many US courts thought that their role was to protect disempowered groups who could not assert themselves in the political process and to ensure that laws do not reduce any disfavored group to a lower caste status or less than equal form of citizenship. At the time Roe versus Wade was decided in 1973, The Supreme Court had not yet held that women qualified for any particular constitutional protection under this clause. And there was ongoing debate over whether to add an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would secure sex equality, an amendment that never was ratified because it is absurdly difficult to amend the U.S. Constitution. But in the decades after Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court came to hold, that laws that draw sex-based distinctions must be given special scrutiny from the courts. In other words, they have to be substantially related to an important government interest or they'll be struck down. In that set of cases, the Supreme Court rejected laws based on overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of men and women. laws based on romantic paternalism that put women not on a pedestal but in a cage, and laws that enforce the ideology of separate spheres, the idea that men's primary roles are in the public sphere of work and government, while women's are in the private sphere of home and hearth as wives and mothers. Laws restricting access to abortion, like the Mississippi one that's challenged in dobs, are premised unexactly these sorts of prohibitive. rationales. As legal historians, like Professor Reva Siegel, have documented, the movement to restrict abortion in the 19th century United States was motivated by concerns that white Protestant women were seeking too many abortions, and white Protestants would soon be outnumbered by new Catholic immigrants, the desire to ensure that all women fulfill their duties as wives and their natural destinies to become mothers, and the paternalistic belief that women are not competent to make decisions in their own best interests. We see these sort of sexist paternalistic rationalistic rationales and laws passed today. So one explicit reason Mississippi gave for its recent ban on abortion after 15 weeks is that abortion is harmful to a woman's physical and mental health. But this is contrary to the medical evidence. The best study I know of, which compared women who were turned away when they attempted to have abortions to women who were able to have abortions, found that those women who had abortions were not more depressed, anxious, or suicidal than those who did not. However, women who were turned away from abortion clinics suffered more anxiety and loss of self-esteem in the short term, we're more likely to stay with abusive partners and we're less likely to report having life aspirations. In the U.S., childbirth is 14 times more likely to result in death than abortion, and in Mississippi, childbirth is 75 times more likely to result in death than abortion, a number that is partly attributable to the fact that many women in Mississippi are black, and black women receive inferior medical care in the U.S. and are three times, more likely to die during pregnancy than white women. In light of this evidence, it's the height of paternalism to say that women should not have the decision because it's contrary to their health. Moreover, those states in the United States that will criminalize abortion after Roe is overruled are the very same states that have decided not to take federal funds to provide better health care to pregnant people and infants, not to offer paid leave for pregnant people, not to offer sufficient welfare assistance for those who have children, and not to offer other forms of public support for new parents, meaning people forced to remain pregnant can lose not just their autonomy, but also their lives and livelihoods. These arguments about discriminatory intent are apart from the arguments about the discriminatory effects of abortion prohibitions in conscripting pregnant people into maternity and denying them the autonomy to make decisions about their own lives. The draft Alito opinion in Dobbs doesn't engage with arguments about how laws restricting abortions subordinate women, whether intentionally or through their effects, other than to say that it's not discrimination against women to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, and we can't really know what motives are in the hearts and minds of legislators as judges. If this were true, it would make it impossible to say laws ever based in discriminatory animus, and it would eviscerate the idea that the Constitution might be a vehicle to protect the powerless or to ensure the premise of equal citizenship. Unfortunately, this is part of a larger trend in U.S. constitutional law, now solidified by the fact that our Supreme Court has a six to three conservative majority, a majority that is unlikely to be dislodged for a generation. Thank you so much for all of your remarks. I wanted to start with the history of Roe and Casey and sort of the reasoning behind those cases. So if we start with very weak weight, we see that that established a trimester framework which banned any legislation restricting abortion in the first trimester, allowed for reasonable health regulations on abortion in the second trimester, and permitted abortion regulations in the third trimester as long as there existed exceptions for health of the mother. What do you think motivated the court to promulgate such specific rules on constitutional abortion regulations, and do you think this was the right approach? I'll take a stab at that, I guess. Well, I mean, at least one point about the trimester system is a value that I think many Americans share. So if you look at the Gallup polling, people have a greater comfort level with earlier abortion. I think that's one of the things that's pretty stunning about the six and the eight-week bans because they're going to disrupt something where I think there was widespread. So maybe I'll just stop on that point and pass to others. So the question is, what motivated the court in row to adopt the trimester framework? Well, I think part of it has to do with the justice who authored the opinion, Justice Blackman, who prior to becoming a Supreme Court justice was a general counsel for the Mayo Clinic, which is a large healthcare facility. And while he was working on the Roe opinion, the story is he went to the Mayo Library and did a bunch of reading about abortion, and he thought abortion was safer in the first trimester. I think he got too much into the medicine, and that one flaw of the Roe opinion is that it focuses too much on doctors, and it looks more at the technical aspects of abortion rather than some of the bigger questions that I think are important, like equal protection, that's neglected in the row draft. But some of the reasons for why the row opinion looks the way it does just have to do with the biography of the justice there. Yes, I agree on the biography point, and Justice Blackman himself acknowledged this at a speech he gave to Harvard Law School at one point, and I think one thing we can reflect on that, is that it very much does seem to be something that came from one individual justice. Of course, the other justices signed on to it, but to go to the broad theme of my remarks, I think that these are the precisely the kinds of issues that need to be debated on a broad basis by legislatures rather than decided almost as a matter of specific legislation by the court itself. That's been one of the things that, again, some of the pro-abortion critics of Roe have singled out as something wrong with the opinion that it tried to be too specific in its ruling. One point I'll make about is that one of the trimester points was meant to turn on the point of viability. And that seems to me a somewhat arbitrary place to draw the line in a couple of respects. It's just it's not quite exactly clear why philosophically the fact that an unboard human being at that point could survive outside the womb would mean that that should have greater legal protection rather than less. And as the Dobbs opinion notes, as medical, advances go forward, the point of viability is brought back, and the point of viability can even depend on how close you are to good medical facilities. So I think that that was one of the things that Casey actually abandoned from Rose. So the viability point to me seems to be something that has been rightly discarded by later jurisprudence. Yeah, thank you, Dr. Yowell. And like he's touched on briefly, Rowe was superseded by a 1992 case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey. In one paragraph, Casey briefly argued that, quote, the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive life. And indeed, this touches on some of the points made by you as well, Professor Clark. The court has held that the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment guarantees equality on the base of sex. What do you believe are the merits, if any, of an equal protection argument in favor of constitutional right to abortion? Well, I think I've already made an argument that the Equal Protection Clause ought to protect the right to abortion. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has a very cramped interpretation of what equal protection means, and it doesn't want to probe deeply into the motives of legislators, so it's hard for it to see that denying the right to abortion threatens the equal citizenship of pregnant people. The court also had an opinion in the 70s called Gaudelig versus Aiello in which it said, it's not discrimination against women to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy because, well, it might be true that only women can get pregnant. The group of non-pregnant people includes both women and men, which to me is just head-scratching formalism. Like how, if it's not discrimination against women to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, I don't know what is. It just, the court there was trying to avoid that outcome, which I think is the way, is something most people would agree with. If you're discriminating on the basis of pregnancy, you're discriminating on the basis of sex. pregnancy is what defines women for many people. One of the things, not the only thing. So it's difficult to make these arguments to the current Supreme Court, which is hostile to them, but I think that they are in the spirit of the 14th Amendment, and they're supported by its text, which requires the protection of the laws. Did you want to offer? Well, let me take a stab at the equal protection idea. Look, the 600 pound elephant in this room is whether there's a second life deserving of equal protection. Now, your points are well taken. I think we do discard the interests of women. I want to be extremely clear. Our recent debates around the contraceptive coverage mandate in the United States are, you know, a testament to that, you know, that women should be able to get contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act in President Obama's words with no hassle, no delay. And those things were found by HRSA, which, you know, the three departments that promulgated these regulations, they were found to matter deeply to women's ability to participate in the workplace on an equal basis, because people have to have the ability to control, their reproductive future. That's all true. What's different about that than abortion is whether there is another life. And if you believe there's another life, and many states have said that by enacting personhood amendments, by reaching back to conception, literally, and saying in Louisiana terms, there's a juridical person here. Well, then the question is, are there two lives? And those lawmakers and those Republican states are going to want people to talk to them honestly about how do we give women the ability to equally operate in world and also consider a second life. Now we might think that second life, what is that? You know, it's a fetus. It's it can't be as important as me here in the flesh. But you're going to have to engage the idea that there's a second life. in life if you're going to argue to outcomes that make people feel like they're getting protections out of these laws that they can live with. That's my fear that you're going, people will have to argue to that. Now I want to say something on a personal note. I'm adopted. I was born in 1966 the year before there was widespread legalization of abortion in California. So I don't actually know how that would have gone. I've never met my birth mother. You know, I'm grateful to my parents for changing the entire arc of my life. But I have no idea how that would have gone if I had been born a year later or conceived a year later. One of my best friends who worked with me on this paper adopted her son. And when I said, what do we do with that issue? She said, all I know is that the woman who gave my son up for adoption so that my husband and I could adopt him, I could not be more grateful. So in this counting of equal rights, there's two lives here. I've just named one myself, this child. Somehow we have to grapple with that. Thank you. Just a couple of very quick points. I was reading an article on this issue this morning, and it referenced a poll, which I didn't check to verify, but the claim was, and I would trust the source from which it came, is that women and men in the United States have broadly the same attitudes on abortion and what the appropriate level of restriction is. And I think that's at least an indication that because many women themselves, do support more abortion restrictions than is currently allowed in some states. And because many women have been leaders in the pro-life movement, that the primary motivation is not one of discrimination or invidious attitudes against women, but the primary motivation, I think, for more restrictive laws is precisely the issue that Dr. Wilson raised of, there being another life at issue. And so my second comment would be that whatever the law says regarding availability or lack there of abortion, as I said in my open remarks, I think we as individuals, we as society members, have strong obligations to, of compassion, of support and and you were a beneficiary of that. And I think that we often have not lived up to those obligations, sometimes as individuals, sometimes as society. And so I think that one way to address some of the concerns about women being neglected in this picture would be to up the ante on the support, the counseling, the material support, et cetera, that society provides for, for women in need. Thank you so much. So if now we sort of turn towards the rise of litigation seeking to overturn Roe and Casey and the reasoning behind Alito's draft opinion and also look towards some different constitutional methodologies. Following the Roe decision, there began a pro-life movement that sought means both legislative and judicial to overturn the decision. May you all explain what led to to Roe being such a controversial decision in your opinion? Well, I'll start. I think part of it I've just addressed, whether you believe that there is a second life. And I think that's a difficult question for many people. I will say that one of the things that has changed, I think there are actually two things that have changed quite a lot since the time of Roe or since my birth. So one is that, is that younger conservatives, which sometimes overlaps with younger people of faith, but they're not always synonymous, okay, or they're not always completely overlapping groups, have come to self-identify around abortion. That's why I think abortion is different than other cultural war issues, where I think we actually have succeeded to find common ground. Because the civil rights that have to be married are like puzzle pieces and they can be made to fit together for many, many things, whether that's transgender athletes, which we're not doing well with in the United States right now, or it's gay rights and religious liberty or whatever. This is incommeasurables. It's one life against another. And so the fighting ground, what's at stake, is wildly different. and people self-identify around that. One quick note. Casey made the point that what Casey was trying to do, I think was, in its own words, call the contending sides of this great debate to a peaceful solution which the different sides would lay down their arms, so to speak. And while the court might have hoped in Roe originally and then in reaffirming Roe and Casey to cause the issue to fizzle out as a political issue, I think precisely the opposite resulted. Abortion has been much more contentious in the United States than in this country, for example. And I think whatever you think about the Abortion Act of 1967, which was enacted by Parliament, here, it was good that people had this debate, that issues were erred and that it was decided democratically. So one of the interesting things about Casey is that it was entertaining the hypothesis that Roe had been wrongly decided. It didn't ultimately say one way or the other on that, but then said it would not overrule Roe because that would be to invite further conflict. Conflict is centered around the court itself. and the hope of Casey was that, again, that the controversy would be stilled. But I think, in fact, what we've seen is that it won't be stilled through an attempt to resolve this matter judicially. I have a more cynical take on polarization in the U.S. today and the role of Roe and Casey, which I think are overstayed. The parties in the United States as they exist today, and the issues that define them were not always the way they are. And in fact, if you go back to the late 60s, the early 70s, you see Republicans supported abortion. Abortion became an issue that is, the pro-life movement became identified with the Republican Party. my view as a result of the strategies of Republican Party leaders in the early 1970s to create the coalition that they have today by uniting Catholics who were opposed to abortion for moral reasons and evangelicals who were uncomfortable with the sexual revolution with women's rights and also Republicans who want less regulation and more free market. And so, So that was a strategy that was a deliberate one by GOP leaders. And now we have these identities in the US based on our political parties that are very entrenched. It is very hard to find common ground because people believe that having a position on abortion is crucial to who you are and who's in what tribe. And it has definitely been damaging to our politics, but I would not blame the Supreme Court for that. I think this is going to persist after they overrule Roe. I don't know that Roe caused it. I don't know what would have happened in a different world in which Roe versus Wade hadn't existed. I could imagine that still being just as polarized on this issue. Thank you. So of course, on the 3rd of May, we learned through Politico that there existed a draft majority opinion. of the case Dobsby Jackson Women's Health Organization, which purports to overturn Roe and Casey. I'd like all of you guys to sort of discuss your take on the reasoning behind the case and your thoughts in the case as a whole. So I'm going to make a typical law professor move and answer a different question than the one that was asked, but I want to say a word about the leak. I think this is just absolutely reprehensible. I think it's so damaging to the trust that justices and judges have for their clerks and their staffs, that it's almost mind-boggling the breach. And this is an important topic. I will not, you know, ever dismiss abortion as an incredibly important topic. But I think as we move forward, we have to talk about what it means for our institutions, there was this kind of breach. I clerked on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for a judge. In some sense, he's like a father figure to me. And I think these opportunities are so rarefied, but I think these institutions can only operate on trust. I have two friends that are clerking on the Supreme Court right now. I'm terrified to talk to either one of them. I'm sure they're terrified to take a call from anybody. Can you imagine? Can you imagine running a chambers this way, having to work for somebody with that cloud now? And it will always be with us, I'm afraid. I've already given my views on Dobbs in my opening remarks and later questions. So I'll pass on that. I agree on the problem with the leak. It's very, it's very, very damaging to the institution and there's under current procedures a real need for secret confidential deliberation and that's going to be harder going forward much harder. So I'm a little hard of hearing. The question is how does the Dobbs opinion affect the legitimacy of the Supreme Court? I was just asking sort of what you think of the reasoning behind the Dobbs case and your thoughts on the case and the whole. my thoughts are on the reasoning of the Dobbs opinion? Well, I don't agree with it. The, I think it is too narrowly focused on the issue of liberty that it doesn't spend enough ink on the issue of equal protection. I also think it is dangerous for the this Supreme Court in its legitimacy during the oral argument, Justice Sotomayor asked whether the Supreme Court could survive the stench of the opinion, which appears to many Americans to be simply partisan, especially since Donald Trump was elected on the promise that he would put justices on the Supreme Court that would overrule Roe v. Wade. And there he did that, and it doesn't look to a lot of people like the Supreme Court is actually following the law. And if the Supreme Court is just another political branch, why are they owed particular respect? They're not elected. So one aspect of the majority opinion is its application of the Glucksburg test, which seeks to identify rights not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution, but still protected by the due process clause of the 14 Amendment. Of course, there exists a school of constitutional thought called originalism, which argues that a given constitutional provisions meaning when it was adopted to its meaning today. All five members of the Dobbs draft majority are self-proported originalists. However, many originalists have argued that the underlying doctrine behind the Glucksburg test applied by Alito, substantive due process, which holds that the due process clauses guarantee of no bridgment of life, liberty, and property without proper legal procedure includes some liberties that no procedure can abridge has no basis in the Constitution. What are your thoughts on originalism and why is that that seemingly Justice Alito's opinion is a partial departure from the originalism putatively espoused by the Dobbs majority members? Well so I think it would be helpful to focus down on physician-assisted suicide in Glucksburg, since that's the decision we're talking about. You know, when Rehnquist authored the opinion, it pushed it back to the states. And we've seen states led by actual people who have said, look, I need physician-assisted suicide. Remember the case of what was the woman's name, Brandy, what was her name in California? I'm sorry, I can't think of it for a moment. You know, but it itself catalyzed four or five states in a row to say, you know what, this is a dumb rule. We're going to allow people to have physician-assisted suicide in California or Nevada or wherever. And not every rule matches the very first state that did that. Oregon's law was more restrictive in many ways than things that came after it. You know, there's somebody I really admire in LGBT rights, a person named Jonathan Rausch. And he has said, look, you know, a law that provides non-discrimination protections to the full LGBT community doesn't have to look the same in Texas as it does in Massachusetts. That's something that, you know, we have to balance in our country, that federalist idea, against the protection, the need to protect minorities who don't have a political voice. So originalism, not originalism, the core project here is, when do we need to override democratic will in order to protect those who are least among us, at least in terms of their ability to move legislatures? But I think there's a hopeful account here, if you're going to talk about physician-assisted suicide, because we have seen a lot of traction, but it's slow. And if you're the person who needs something and it has yet to come to your state, it's too slow. I've been in this country for 20 years now, and over that time, I've become more inclined to the British way of resolving these things constitutionally, which is a principle known as parliamentary sovereignty. And while there's a human rights act, here that allows courts to declare decisions of the executive or legislature as the government or the legislature as against human rights ultimately it's parliament's final decision this is a different approach from what the u.s took historically and and i think that if you if you go down the path of allowing courts to adjudicate the meaning of very broad abstract moral rights, such as in the European Convention of Human Rights or the U.S. Bill of Rights, there's a bit of a mismatch philosophically between giving courts that power and the textualism that's at the core of the originalist philosophy. And so I would say, as a colleague of mine, has said that in some respects, originalism is the right answer to the wrong, question. That is, originalism I think should always be a kind of starting point when you're dealing with a specific legislative text or a kind of law that's different from the broad abstract moral rights in the U.S. Constitution. That said, originalism began mainly in the United States, not so much, I think, as a grand theory of interpretation, but as a means of judicial restraint. And so there was a concern in the 1960s, 1970s, that the Supreme Court of the United States was becoming increasingly activist and striking down laws that ought to been decided by the legislature. So originalism, I think, had its major impetus as making the simple point that if the Constitution doesn't clearly provide in its text as originally understood in its original public meaning that a particular choice that a legislature made is unconstitutional, then the courts should just back off and let the legislature decide. And so I, in, originalism understood as a doctrine of restraint, I support. I would, and I would read Justice Lito's opinion adobes as largely in that vein. It's it's how, I think basically Justice Scalia or Judge Bork would have decided the case. Just drawing back from judicial interference in this decision saying the Constitution doesn't speak here, this is a matter for states legislatures to decide. End of story. And I think I support originalism in that sense. Okay, a few points. First, there is debate over whether Dobbs is an originalist opinion. Stephen Calabrese, who is a prominent academic originalist, wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, arguing that Dobbs is bad originalism because it relies on Washington v. Glucksburg, this precedent for its test that fundamental rights have to be deeply rooted in the nation's tradition and history, which Professor Calabresi doesn't even know what where did that come from? Where is that in the original meaning of the Constitution? So is Dobbs originalist? I'm not sure. I myself am not an originalist I think that history is an important tool for interpreting the Constitution, but we can't be mired in what people thought the U.S. Constitution meant in at the time of the founding or even even 1868 because it is so hard to amend the US Constitution. If we were stuck with what people thought centuries ago, there would be no right to sex equality in the United States. I'll also just say that there is a good originalist argument for the equal protection point that I made, that the Equal Protection Clause was originally intended to abolish caste legislation and to ensure equal citizenship. And we have to apply the words of the Equal Protection Clause that everyone is entitled to equal protection to our context today. And in doing that, we are going to have to figure out what the principles are behind the Equal Protection Clause and then ask how they apply to women today. And I think that that is consistent with fidelity to the original meaning of the Constitution. There's a good article by Jack Balkin makes this argument. Thanks so much. Obviously, Professor Wilson, you already touched on the negative implications of the leak of this draft opinion and what this means for the legitimacy of the Supreme Court as a whole. But if we look towards finally the future of abortion rights in a potentially post-row world, Professor Mary Siegler argued that even legally, abortion will continue to be litigated, and indeed some conservatives, and most notably Professor John Finnis have argued that fetuses are persons and in turn deserving of constitutional rights. Meanwhile, some self-professed liberal originalists have argued that the original meaning of the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection on the basis of sex and in turn a right to abortion. Do you think abortion will continue to be a hot button legal issue in the future? I think that has to be a yes, but let me say one thing. You know, we haven't paid enough attention in this conversation to the fact that the 50 states have their own constitutions. And that the constitutions of the states did a lot of the very important work in recognizing same-sex marriage, for example, before a Bergerfeld. And so it was a conversation between the litigation over the constitution of those states and then what was happening in state houses. So I think that's an important point. I want to talk about Fennis for a second and the idea of person. I talked about a juridical person a few minutes ago. I actually think there is a way in which we might get to more consensus around abortion and the needs of women. Very quickly by making this question, this idea of personhood and a juridical person, real in the law. So this should be a men's issue, not a women's issue only. If you take that the life is a person, then a woman who is not a woman who is not a woman, then a woman who is not able to receive an abortion should be receiving child support immediately. If she has healthcare costs and bringing the child to term, those should be paid for by the father of that child. If, for example, she needs bed rest or she isn't able to work in the labor force because she is required to carry to term a child that is his, then he can pay the lost wages and labor for that. And then we can start from there to talk about what it will mean if women have been raped because we are going to see, I believe, lots of charges of rape and incest, actually being visited upon families and young men and men and whoever. Not that men can't be raped, by the way, but that doesn't result in a child, to my knowledge. Okay. And I'm not going to claim that I know all of the biology. I'm not like Justice Blackman. What I will say, though, is that you will see this issue become deeply personal to men very quickly. And that might actually change what happens in state houses. So I would agree with the point that male irresponsibility is a major issue and something that will have to be addressed. and I agree in principle with the suggestions on child support, etc. I think in many cases that could be a place to start perhaps, but there will have to be a state backup because there won't just be always the financial means there to carry out the necessary support. I do think, obviously, abortion will continue to be a hot button, and legal issue, I think, were the words you use. But I do think we're going to see very much a shift to the state court, state houses where legislature sit and not courts, rather than litigation. I expect there will be some litigation at the margins. And I think this partially may depend on some technicalities of the final shape of the Dobbs' opinion. And as it's written, I think the effect of it will. be to probably shift most of the effort away from litigation, but there could be slight changes to the articulation of the test. Right now, it's put as a rational basis test, and a number of interests that the state is submitted, is allowed to take into consideration or listed. If that were to change a bit, for example, it could open the question up to more litigation. I might just make one quick point in connection with euthanasia, which has been mentioned in the Glicksburg case. So the claimed right to physician-assisted suicide is itself a hot-button issue in various states in the U.S., in many countries around the world. There's a major Canadian Supreme Court decision on this some years ago that held that there was a right to physician's suicide. The UK courts took the opposite path of deferring to Parliament on this issue. But I think as things stand, you've seen the Canadian case accepted more of a willingness to argue this out in legislatures and politics. And I expect that the future of abortion debate will look more like the euthanasia debate now. I'm so pessimistic about American politics and polarization. I don't see compromises happening. I see pitched battles in which people will not give an inch, There will be a fight for fetal personhood to say that, you know, if you go and you do artificial, use artificial reproductive technologies to get pregnant, and you have embryos that those are people. The embryos in the freezer are people. If you get an IUD, an intrauterine device, there are people in the U.S. who say that is potentially preventing an egg from implanting, and that is an abortion, so you can't have an IUD. These are the kinds of extreme positions that are going to be argued over in politics and in litigation. We already see people taking these positions. And on the other side, there are extreme positions as well. There are people who think abortion should be legal with no restrictions up until the date of delivery. I think it's really hard to find compromises where people feel like their identity is at stake in every argument. and so we're going to see this at the national level. There's going to be a push from both sides for national level legislation. We're going to see it at the state level. And I think we're going to set a bad example internationally. I think that the success of the conservative legal movement in overruling row is going to inspire backlash efforts in other countries where the trend has been towards liberalization of abortion laws. I wish that it was possible to have discussions over abortion the way people rationally discuss euthanasia, but that's just not how it works out in our political culture in the U.S. Thank you so much, Professor Clark. And indeed, that brings us to the conclusion of our panel. Would everyone join me in thanking our three panelists for those friends? Thank you.
