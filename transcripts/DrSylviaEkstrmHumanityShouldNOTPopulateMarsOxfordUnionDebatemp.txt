 I now look to Dr. Sylvia Erkstrom to continue the case for the opposition. And I'm yours. So we went to the moon. I know some people doubt it, but we went to the moon. Or should I say maybe a few of us went there? So we have seen humans on a distant celestial body, walking, jumping on a celestial body. Not so distant, by the way. The moon is so closed. And these images have. set our imaginations on fire. Science fiction movies have brought us further away, showing humans exploring the galaxy or even the universe as a routine occupation. So why not go to Mars? Like children's, we have the feeling that our capacity of exploration has no limits. However sooner or later, the child discovers, that indeed his body marks the limits. No, the fingers don't go in the plug. Okay, out in the... The needs and limitations of our body complicate enormously both the journey and the conditions for surviving Mars. Now, the motion we vote or we debate today is not about merely exploring Mars for a few months and come back. No, no, no, this House considers Populating it. And the long-term thriving of a population, this is an entirely different story. The first flow I see in this project is that Mars is not a habitable planet, at least not by us. It has lost its atmosphere billions of years ago, and with it the capacity to flow water, liquid water. Mars is based in the UV radiation of the sun. It cannot protect its surface from asteroids and cosmic rays. We earthlings are born and evolved on Earth, perfectly adapted to its specific gravity, pressure, atmosphere, and perfectly inadapted to anything that deviates from these conditions. When we move out of Earth's habitable layer, which is very thin, by the way, we need to build bubbles of habitability, like planes, submarines, or spacesuits. You will probably tell me that we know how to do that. We know even how to maintain a handful of people in the space station. Yes, indeed, but here we are only talking about transitory survival. Astronauts spend six months to one year in the space station, and their bodies suffer from this time spent without gravity with a high radiation background. Their bones become porous, their muscle melt, their arteries get 20 years older, their DNA is perturbed. I stop here, but I promise you the list is much, much, much longer. Traveling to Mars will take about the same duration with an even higher level of radiation, so we can expect that our travelers will be in very poor shape when landing. Once on Mars, the radiation is still high, and even gravity is not absent, it is much lower than on Earth, so we don't know if and how quickly they can recover from the journey. I said it and repeat here, Mars is not a habitable planet. This statement is not anecdotic. It really reveals a terrible reality, Humans on Mars will have to survive an extremely hostile environment, and the cost to build the needed bubble of habitability will be outrageous. Even those eccentric billioners who are competing now to show that they have the biggest rocket might wins away from such expenses. The second flow I see, and if I may, I think we are looking at this mass settlement with an incomplete point of view. We always imagine that we can go there alone. Like we went to the moon, humans with their pack of sandwiches up there. But to survive too and then on Mars, we cannot go alone. In particular, if we want a full population to live and develop there, the question of feeding properly this point, is not a detail in the endeavor. Because we know now that the microorganism in our gut play a fundamental role in our global health, body and mind, and they directly depend on our diet. We need to ensure diverse food supply to maintain a healthy population and avoid deficiencies leading to large-scale diseases. The harsher the conditions, the more important is a healthy diet to keep our bodies fit to fight. Unfortunately, the number of plants that can grow in hydropony is extremely limited. So please take it just a minute and think about the field surface that just one village needs to feed its population. And now imagine it is not a village, but a village. a village but a town or a city. Imagine the surface needed. And now remember that Mars is the worst desert that you can ever imagine. And its atmosphere is the equivalent of Earth's atmosphere at 35 kilometers of altitude, so four times higher than the Mount Everest. Mars cannot be terraformed. There is just not enough volatile. to do so. So how could we build greenhouses wide enough to just feed the people? If this house decides to populate Mars, it means in reality that we have to create a living biosphere there. Through the 3 million years since the apparition of Homo, we progressively raised ourselves on top of the food chain and sometimes we can we con we can confuse this top of food chain with the top of the evolution. But being at the top of the food chain means that we depend on every single link below. Plants grow on soils rich in microorganisms. They are fertilized by pollinizers. The pollinizers need to be controlled by birds, but then the birds needs to be controlled by bigger birds or predators. It is the never-ending chain of life. of life. There was an experiment in the desert of Arizona. It was called Biosphere 2, what a name. It was an attempt to recreate a self-sustaining, autonomous, closed system able to support the life of a few people. It failed after just a few months because one species, one microorganisms there, became too happy and started eating all the oxygen. The pollinizer died, the cockroach swarmed, and the humans had to open the window. But on Mars, there will be no window to open. On a planet-sized biosphere like Earth, if one species disappears, the niche that became empty is soon occupied by another one. and the equilibrium is restored. But this is because the planet's living layer is hundreds, millions of years old, and it is rich of billions of species. We will never be able to recreate such an incredible system elsewhere. My very last point has to do with us not going there alone, precisely. Some biologists like to call us consortia instead of individuals. Why that? Because when we count all the microorganism that we carry inside and out around us and those microorganisms are essential for our life, we could not live without them, well, they are more numerous than our own human cells. In other words, we are walking contaminants. Mars is the closest and probably the only place where we can hope to find an answer to one of the oldest question of humanity. Is there a life elsewhere in the universe? And thank you for punctuated it. So well. When we send robots and probes, we can sterilize them to a high degree. And so we ensure that they do not spill earth's bacteria on Martian soil. By sending human there, we will not be able to do so. We will be sending billions and billions of bacteria more or less stored in a space suit, I grant you that, but we can never know if they will not leak out of it and maybe end up in some comfort place where maybe some pristine Martian life forms are trying to survive. When we will look for life on Mars, will we be able to distinguish between Earth and Mars life forms? Because the answer to that question is we don't know. The space treaty has a very strict Article 9 that states, states parties to the treaty shall pursue studies of outer space, including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them, so as to avoid their harmful contamination. And where necessary, shall adopt appropriate measures for this power, We are earthlings bound to the most beautiful planet and hospitable planet that you can ever imagine. For not letting irrealistic dreams become nightmares, and for not taking the risk of destroying a rare archive of how a life starts on the planet, I urge this house to reject the motion. Thank you.
