 I'd like to open tonight's debate looking to Trump Elliott, classic students from new college. Thank you very much, Mr President, for the new college. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak in this debate. albeit with about 20 minutes notice, I think that might be a record in the society's history. So you might have noticed that I'm not in fact, Rosalie Chapman, and you might also notice that I have not in fact finished writing my speech, but here goes. I'm going to briefly admit that I haven't had the fullest opportunity to research the topic, so there may be some sort of caveat, some curtailed points, but I hope you will forgive me, and I hope that I'll be able to sort of elucidate to you why borders and indeed the concept of the next, nation state are things that we as a global 21st century society should seek to move beyond. So the task that falls to me tonight is to propose the abolition of borders. And this is something which I actually believe in, perhaps to the surprise of some in the audience. But to my mind, the abolishment of borders and the question of this can be subdivided to two categories. So firstly, we have the negative impact of borders themselves on trade, on productivity, on people's lives. And secondly, we have the negative impact of the nation state and and the sort of ideas of identity, cultural, ethnic, etc., which these predicate. So on the converse, of course, the abolishment of borders, and by extension the erosion of the concept of the nation state, will lead to many benefits which I will seek to make evident. So I'd like to start tonight by introducing the speakers on the opposition. So first up, we have Abigail Bacon, who studies history and politics at Brazenoes College. It's lucky she's speaking tonight, because if she's spoken last week, Stephen would have fried her. Alex Fish said that if that one went down well, I'm to attribute it to him. So second, sorry, we have Professor Michael Hatcher. Is that wrong? No, it's completely right. Brilliant. The Foundation Professor of Political Science at Arizona State University. So I once met a border guard from Arizona while I was out traveling, actually. And I hope that you and he don't quite share the same views. Third, we have Dr. Catherine Bragg, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. From what I've heard, she lives in Toronto, flew to Dublin family, flew to Oxford and is now travelling to London before finally returning to Toronto. Can you imagine how much easier her life would be without borders? But I do imagine that as an employee of the UN, she might be out of a job. Finally, we've got Augustine Chan, who studies law at LMH, a college so far away that I'm sure he had to cross some sort of borders to get here. So before the debate, Augustine came to me, and he was really worried about what sort of roast I would have for him, but luckily for him, I haven't seen enough of him on committee to actually have any. All right, so moving on to the substance. I'd like to engage in a little bit of rebuttal about the points which I suppose the opposition speakers will make, namely that removing borders would encourage supposedly harmful immigration, and the corroborate sense of cultural community, which is created by geographically distinct areas and their reinforcement by national borders. Superficially, these are reasonable points. However, both are, of course, predicated on an idea that... I'm sorry, I lost my place. Predicated from harmful beliefs that different groups of people ought to inhabit different places. On the contrary, it's important to understand the benefits of increased immigration, cultural mixing, and globalism. Increased immigration simply from an economic point of view, enlarge the pool of work in a given area, increasing the sort of benefits of productivity from having a larger group of people to employ. I think we can all agree also that exposure to different cultures is ultimately a good thing as somebody who at school is opposed to many different people of different many different cultures. I think that personally has enriched my life to a great extent and this serves to broaden one's horizons if nothing else. There's also the point which is perhaps the most important one that I'll be making tonight. But most people don't actually want to cross borders permanently and that subsequently those who do have pretty serious reasons for wanting to do so. Is it really within the rights of a state, which, let's not forget, allows plenty of people in every year as legal migrants, to turn people away on the basis of generally crude or even culturally predicated criteria? To my mind, and I hope to many of yours, is simply a scapegoat when the governments of various nations cite terrorism was an excuse by this idea that people who migrate to various different regions will form culturally distinct bubbles and break up the harmony of a community. I shall not deny that this does on occasion happen, but I think the terrorism argument is a completely redundant one simply because of the absolute infrequency of such occurrences while the argument that people might refuse to integrate is completely paradoxical if one argues in favour of borders which are essentially nation-sized groups of people refusing to integrate on a global scale then how can one attack the refusal of individuals to integrate on the level of a neighbourhood or a street so that's enough rebuttal let me begin with the ideal and the ideal is a to my mind a global state perhaps that's not something we'll ever achieve but that's something we should at least aspire to for several reasons. So the first is that there's a benefit to trade. I mean we've recently seen a huge rise in fuel costs rise in tariffs. I went to Tesco and my meal deal costs £3.50 instead of £3. I wonder why. You know, these sorts of problems would be at least mitigated if not completely avoided by getting rid of tariffs, getting rid of trade agreements and having a global state without borders where one could trade freely with anyone across the globe. secondly and particularly personally presently there is the problem of war because of borders and nations wanting to change borders. I look at Russia and the Ukraine and I see a conflict happening because of a border that one of the size does not agree with. In a world without borders, in a world of course without the nation state, there would of course be some civil war some sort of conflicts but these would not be on the scale of ideologically predicated or geographically predicated conflicts where one nation try, one larger nation generally tries to consume a smaller one through sort of delusions of its own greatness. But even if this idea of a global state isn't feasible, there are still many, many problems with the borders that exist in the present day and the concept of borders is these sort of hard lines over which one cannot cross. Can we really argue, for example, that nations which are like literally square are represented to the cultural complexities that occur in different regions of the globe? I think not. I think on the contrary, they are hangovers, these borders, of the actions of colonial powers following landmarks like rivers or just following lines on a map. I think that's really something we have to move beyond in a 21st century where we have such things as trade, we have such things as sort of globalization, global economy, everyone knows what's going on in every other country, and to be trapped by these sort of lines on a map from over 100 years ago is really quite reductive. Moving on to the idea of the nation state, is very much a post-World War I, post-Versai idea, where the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire were divided up by these victorious powers into these sort of ethnically and culturally homogenous groups of people. I think nowadays when we look at sort of the nature of countries across the globe, the idea of a nation state where people encourage really to only integrate with, only sort of interact with one's own community on the basis of these pretty outdated ideas is really, really reductive. I think, you know, with the nature of the problems we're facing, particularly global warming, things which encourage sort of a absolutely global response, we cannot be having a world in which countries refuse to cooperate on the basis of ethnicity. I think that is completely, completely off the cards. And on that subject of global warming, I think if we look at sort of how some parts of the world getting hotter, how some are prone to severe weather events, as humans, can we really stand here in Britain, a country which is very safe from all these things and say, you can't come in, we were here first? to my mind that is not right and on that note and on the note of all of the benefits of immigration which I've outlined all the sort of the negatives of having existing boards and the idea of the nation state I would urge you firmly to support this motion thank you Thank you.
