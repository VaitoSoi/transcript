 Thank you. I'd first like to thank the Honorable President and the whole organizing team of the Oxford Union for inviting us, but also for bringing this important topic to the table. Whilst COVID, the Russian attack, the Iranian regime, and the implementation of revolving doors in Downing Street, are very often dominating political. debates, the war on drugs still goes on and to warn drugs is a war on people. And this indicates daily human rights violation in every single country on this earth. So let's get this debate, getting a little bit more into detail. So what do we actually want? This house would legalize drugs for personal use. So let's look at the three terms here. What does legalize mean, what does drugs mean, what does personal use mean? So first, legalization does not mean anything more than establishing a regulatory framework. This can be anything from selling something in the supermarket, like currently coffee and wine, from a prescription model where you actually, like, you currently give methadone out to people who have an opioid use disorder. I would like to give a brief example how I would imagine this. For example, with cocaine-containing products. And this is actually very close my suggestion to what also the transformed drug policy group. And for example, Steve Roles tried to explain in their books on how to regulate stimulants. In three categories. Coker tea, coca candy, coca pouches like Mambay. These are actually products. you can actually sell in the supermarket because, I mean, although they're currently banned, there are not more potent than coffee. I would say that most of those products are actually less potent than coffee. So, yeah, bring them in the supermarket. Let's support the Indian industries and bring those products here. Then, of course, big topic, cocaine. So cocaine, hydrocrite formulations for snorting. Here I see something like a pharmacy like shop for adults. of course without advertisement with safer use and addiction support where needed and where only small amounts are sold to individuals after consulting. And of course there are those people who have issues and they consume a lot. So if people really have a cocaine use disorder and regularly consume large amounts of cocaine or crack cocaine, base or inject cocaine, they could be described a medical device, something like a cocaine e-cigarette, which is actually a publication. I recently did with a harm reduction expert in Germany. So just that you get an idea how, what a regulatory model could look like. So this is the legalization part. Coming to the next expression, what does the term drugs mean? I mean originally it meant something like dry herbs. Nowadays, everyone is associating drugs of abuse, but actually it's a social construct. If you ask people for a scientific definition, they don't tell you one. I mean, if they tell you one, it's usually not true. They tell you it's about addictivity, but why is then tobacco as one of the most addictive drug legal? And LSD as a drug which is not addictive at all and has even anti-addictive properties, not legal. So if you really dig down, you only only, you find one definition and this is drugs are what other people take. Punishing friends and family for smoking tobacco, drinking whiskey or taking prescribed opioids is never a topic for prohibitionists. The origin for picking out certain drugs is racism and discrimination. Coffee is as much of a drug as coca tea, beer is as much of a drug as cannabis, whiskey is as much of a drug as opium. So this whole drug definition, although we use, use it here in this debate is not ideal. This is why I very often also refer to psychotropic or psychoactive substances. But let's get to the third and most important term, personal use. Personal use on the one hand means, of course, when we want to legalize it, decriminalization, but maybe as opposed to Portugal, it would be legally manifested. So it will be actually written down in the law that quantities up to this and that for position would not be. be a crime, but it also means because we want to legalize a safe supply. Please keep in mind that the variability and potency and the adulterance are the main cause for deadly overdoses. Multiple European cities have therefore medical practices where they give out farm upgrade heroin on site. Not a single death reported. At the end of the day, heroin is a moderately strong pain medication. It was a proof for application in children. Of course there are risks, particularly with regard to substance use disorders and developing tolerance and withdrawal effects if you stop using it. But what the media often portrays, it's ridiculous, and it's very often much more an indication of what prohibition is doing. So watch out for straw man, particularly from this side. We are not debating for a commercial retail market. I mean, maybe for Coca-T, maybe for CBD, products. We are talking about still restricted markets. Restricted markets are working. I mean, we see that less people nowadays smoke tobacco. And people who want this nicotine kick, they still tend to go to safe alternatives like e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches or snooze. So we are talking about finding a regulatory optimum for each major drug. And this can be actually quite different from drug to drug. There's a concept developed by a British physician, so-called paradox of prohibition. It's a parabola. And on the y-axis, you basically show the social and health harm. The two worst ways how to regulate drugs are, on the one hand, commercialization without a good way. any rules with, you know, very neoliberal approaches, selling as much as possible, you know, making little chocolate cigarettes for children so they immediately, you know, when they are little toddlers, they already learn how to hold a cigarette, then, you know, putting the cigarettes into the hand of a cowboy on the screen and, hey, you want it could be cool cowboys, smoke normal. This is what we don't want. This is causing harm, yes. But on the other hand, the other most harmful way would be a prohibition with a punitive approach, where you have gangsterism, where you have, so people who already suffer from maybe a drug addiction, they suffer even more from police violence and from penalties. Jail is not helping people. I mean, it's maybe helping dealers to sell more drugs long term, as we just heard. So there is a sensible regulation somewhere in the middle. And of course, this type of regulation is different from drug to drug. Of course, coffee should be differently regulated than cannabis. And cannabis should be differently regulated than ecstasy. And ecstasy should be maybe different regulated than heroin. But there is a better regulatory model for each drug, and every model is better than current prohibition. Please remember my examples for cocaine containing products. We have to give people the choice also for getting weaker products. Not everyone wants to smoke some skunk or some cannabis with synthetic cannabinoids on top. Some people want some old-school bird. Wasn't that appropriate? So there is a sensible regulation for each drug and free to challenge me on this. And this is particularly the reason why this house would like to legalize drugs for personal use. So watch out for the straw man. Thank you.
