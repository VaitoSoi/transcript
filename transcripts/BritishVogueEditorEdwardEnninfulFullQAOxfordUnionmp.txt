 Thank you. What a lovely welcome. Thank you so much for joining us today. My pleasure. Thank you for having me. It's actually my second time here. Yes, last time you were interviewing. Yeah, I was in your seat, interviewing the lovely Mark Jacobs, so I'm really glad to be here. Thank you. Well, let's start with a nice big question. Can you briefly outline your career and in the fashion industry and how you've got to where you are today? Well, I'm very old. Let's just start there. Sort of the late 80s, I was 16 years old. studying at Kingsway College in London. I didn't know anything about fashion. I mean, my mom made clothes, so I would help I make clothes, but that was all I knew about fashion. I didn't think it was a career. I didn't, you know, I come from a very strict sort of African family. So, you know, you had to be a lawyer. All the lawyers here, congratulations, because that's what my dad really wanted. One day I was stopped by a stylist called Simon Foxton to model. And then he introduced me to a magazine called ID magazine where I would sort of intern while I was at school while I was at college I'd sort of intern by modeling just trying to do everything at the age of 16. And then when I was 18 I was made fashion director where I was like a one-man army where I would style the covers, I would write the features, I'd do the shopping pages, I mean, literally do everything. In a way, I realized I was probably for the good groundwork for what I'm doing today. So from ID, I sort of became a freelance stylist where I was to work it for ID. I was contributing editor for Japan Vogue. I had a long stretch working at Italian Vogue from that sort of 96 to, well, to like 2010 or something. I asked a contributing editor where I'd work with Stephen Maisal, the really great photographer. Then from there I went to American Vogue for seven years where I worked with Anna Winter. Then I was creative director at W Magazine and then I ended up at British Vogue. Don't let anyone tell you it's you know when you see people in a role you always think they just got there, but there's always so much work behind it and I've been doing this for 30-something years and I still don't feel like I've quite got the handle of it. So that's the journey, And you mentioned that your mother, so close with youth, how do you think your upbringing influenced your decision to go into fashion? Did that play into your creative process now? Yeah, I mean, you know, I always say, you know, even though I grew up in England and London, I lived in an African household where every day I'd see sort of different colors, different, there were different smells, different foods. And then I'd go to school and I'll be, you know, I'll go with my friends in my uniform, you know, eating chips in bread, chip buttee, whatever they call it. So you kind of straddle two worlds. And that's really what's sort of inspired me, even more, as much as the dressmaking, knowing how to make clothes. The idea of duality is really what's important in my job. I can put myself in other people's shoes, you know. And I'm going to come back to another word I always use, which is I had empathy because. because I was the other. You know, I wasn't your normal English boy. You know, I was from another country. I wasn't immigrant. So having that outsiders perspective more than anything, really it's what my work is about or makes it what it is. And now you're a British Vogue? And now I'm a British work. Did you have a goal when you became editor-in-chief? When I became, I mean, look, Vogue is sort of the greatest magazine in the world. the history, you know, the culture behind it. When I got the job, all I wanted to do really was to bring Vogue back to the Vogue I knew growing up in the 70s, which was about all kinds of women, you know, women of different races, different classes, different sexualities, different sizes. I wanted everybody to sort of be welcome within those pages. I wanted Vogue to be a home. I mean, I remember when I took the job and talked to some friends of mine, and they felt sometimes excluded, and for me to be able to work on such a brilliant title and embrace people who normally thought, oh, Vogue is not for us, it's sort of, was a real great thing, I don't know, for me to want to tackle. And I remember they were saying things like, you know, oh, diversity, you know, diversity doesn't sell, non-white models on covers don't sell, you know, covers had to be a certain way, stare at the camera, smile. For me, it was about breaking all those rules. And, you know, we broke them and, you know, to great success. But I really wanted to give the magazine to, you know, everybody out there while still retaining the sort of the level, the Vogue level. And how do you decide which risks to take in your editorials when you're breaking those rules? What's your creative process? I mean, you know, first of all, you can't do, no man is an island. I have the best team in the world. I always say, you know, a multitude of voices is better than a singular one. So I really trust my team. You know, they're all invested in the vision of British folk. You know, sometimes they call me out for not sort of not thinking something through or whatever. So we know we have the usual, you know, we brainstorms, but they come from the same place. We're all on the same trajectory. We all believe in the same things. We all believe in equality. We all believe in empathy. We all believe in, you know, sort of using our voices to, in a small way, make the world a better place. You know, so I have a great team and, yeah, you can't do it on your own. Could you give us an insight into the creative process behind the February cover? The January cover, which one was that? The one that you've just released, right? Oh, that one. Look, I've always For me, it was quite a simple thing. You know, I've been around, like I said, I've been around for a long time, and I remember there was a moment where we had all these Brazilian models, and it was a Brazilian wave, and then we had all these Dutch models, and it was a Dutch wave, and we had, you know, the Russian models. And I just thought, oh my God, all the girls sort of at the forefront of editorial and shows and campaigns are essentially African models. And this hasn't happened probably since the days of Saint Laurent in the 70s or 80s. So it was just a celebration of these incredible models and to sort of create an image that was sort of very artistic and also very high fashion. So we had fun doing that. Do you think the criticism that you've had has been fair? Criticism? I mean, not a day goes by that I don't get criticized. For me, it's just, it's all noise. It's all noise. You know, when I see young women coming up to me on the streets, you say, thank you for a cover. Or a woman who's plus size saying, I see myself. I always say, if you can see it, you can be it. So for me, those people are more important than noise. And noise is great for magazines. You know, everyone says magazines are dying, right? And magazines can still create a noise. So it's all good. And outside of fashion, where do you turn for inspiration? On the streets, I mean, on the streets, on obsessory street fashion, films, art, you know. For me, inspiration can come from anywhere. I don't really block anything out. But I do watch a lot of films and what do I always say to my team? To put a magazine together, I always think of reflection, projection, documentation. right? So reflection that's sort of, you know, looking back through history and sort of reflecting it forward. Projection means what's to come. What can I give the reader who hasn't seen this before? And documentation, of course, this is what I love most of this is what the world we're living today. So I always have, it's almost like child's play when I put a magazine together. I always have those three sort of points in mind, really. Well, when you move to Vogue Italian, You said that you moved from a London stylist to a grown-up stylist. What did you mean by that? Well, you know, I grew up in the 90s, you know, we sort of, myself and my generation sort of invented Grunge, if you wanted to say, you know, the Face magazine ID, Kate Moss. And in London, Grunt was very much about, you know, that one piece of clothing. So you'd obsess over one jacket for weeks. And you shoot that jacket over six weeks to tell a story. or a pair of jeans or whatever. So it was very much sort of grounded in minimalism. So I remember, you know, getting a job with Italian Vogue with a great Stephen Maisal, you know, one of the greatest fashion photographers ever lived. And I was very cocky, London, you know, very young. You know, I knew better than him. And I remember the first look, the first look was essentially, you know, a pair of hipster jeans and a white shirt. And he loved it. And then I thought, okay, now I'm going to mix it up. another pair of hystere jeans on the white shirt, but this on the sleeve was long, he sort of rolled up. And I remember Stephen looking to me going, can you do anything else? And from that moment, he became sort of the best teacher, you know, a year from that time, there were hats, they were fast, there were jewelry, you know, so he really, Italian Vogue really sort of made me mature as a stylist. But he also thought even more about a narrative, a fashion narrative, telling a story with images because, let's face, if, you know, people think fashion is frivolous, but fashion can change the world we live in, you know? Fashion can reflect the society we live in. For me, like Nilla Simone said, we have to reflect the times we live in, so that's always on my mind, you know. And there's been an increased emphasis on diversity in British Vogue and now in the wider fashion industry. How do you see that influencing the future of creative industries in general? I think it's really great that everyone sort of embrace diversity. And moving forward, I feel like the landscape has changed, hopefully permanently. But the problem I have is, you know, when people put a little image, a little square image on their Instagram, or when people, you know, use models in their campaigns, it's great. But that's just the beginning. To really have a company that speaks to everybody, you need people behind the scenes. You need people of color. need women. You need, you know, different, I don't know, people of different sizes to be behind the scenes, you know, to really make progress happen. Being performative, it's fine, but we need proper progress. So I feel that with diversity now, people are really taking it very seriously and employing people behind the scenes. So that's what I'm really sort of very keen to keep pushing, you know. And you see that progress happening now? Yes, I see it happening, but for me, it's never enough. For me, we have to keep pushing. We have to keep making the world a better place, you know. And that's what we do with Vogue every month. We don't sit back and say, oh, we've had, you know, three covers of, you know, non-white, whatever you want to call it, we still keep pushing. And, you know, there's a page in the magazine that I love called the Viewpoint Pages, and, you know, my editors will tell I'm obsessed with those pages. And it's just women telling their stories. whether it's about growing up in Northern Ireland, whether it's, you know, talking about sort of abortion, just the heavy subjects, that Vogue wasn't supposed to tackle. But I feel that the beauty now is the magazine can now speak of, you know, all topics that women care about. So that's really a proud moment. And Vogue has been seen to become a bit more political since you became editor-in-chief. Could you talk about what you think the responsibility for creatives is in the wider sort of, cultural, social, political conversation we're having at the moment. I go back to saying that, you know, an artist or art has to reflect the times we live in. And I don't even see it as political. I just see it as what is around in the world. Issues in the world, you know. Of course, we're still the best of photography, we're still the best of fashion, and putting that together, putting, you know, what's happening culturally with what we do best. For me, that's what makes Vogue the best magazine in the world. So I don't go in thinking it has to be political, or it's not going to think it has to be political, It's just what is a zeitgeist? What do people care about in the world? What should we highlight? But always through the Vogue Lens, always elevated. And you've been pushing for more representation in fashion since the early, early days of your career. Do you have any advice for anyone here who's trying to do the same in their own industries? Be fearless. Always question. Don't just take everything at face value. Be inquisitive. try and find out about other cultures, try and find out about, you know, other people. Just don't stop learning. I think when people in my position sit back and think, oh, I've done it, that comes before a fall. And what pushes me is, I'm going to be very honest, my insecurities and my, you know, the fact that I want to learn. You know, I want to learn from, you here. I want to learn for my friends. I want to learn from society at large. So always be curious, always, never lose that. And you spoke out very powerfully in 2020 about your experiences being racially profiled at work. Have those experiences changed the way that you approach your work? I always say thank God for those experiences because those experiences keep me level. Those experiences keep me who I am. Those experiences make me realize that we still have work to do. Because look, if it can happen to me, it can happen to anybody, but I'm in a position to do something about it. And so those, it's almost like those things happen always a blessing. When they happen are a blessing. So it just makes you want to keep going. You know, I don't stop. And what's your inspiration as an editor? My inspiration as in... Is it, so when you became an editor of, I suppose, editor-in-chief of British Vogue, did your sources of inspiration change from when you were a stylist and looking at just the fashion? Well, I guess, yeah, I mean, it's two disciplines, isn't it? When you're a stylist, you really care about the image, you care about your clothes, you're telling the story through one channel. But as an editor, you have to oversee everything. So I went from being obsessed with one item of clothing to just being like, okay, how does this fit in the mix? So you almost have a, you know, you're on top having a view of everything, and then you need incredible soldiers. So standing was always about me, and it was so personal. But now I can sit back and go, okay, this is not to my taste, but it kind of appeals to a certain audience. For me, it's all about audience. You know, when we talk about, it's not just a magazine. When we talk about audience, I talk about sort of digital. Because for me, you can't talk about one without the other. You know, in the old days when you shot a cover as a stylist, it was, okay, what is that image? But now I need, what is the video? What is the audio component? What is the event? So that's how my job has changed from being just a stylist. It's just having this huge play, sort of a huge play field. You know, for instance, if I'm, say, shooting Beyonce and I get a message saying, oh, she would do the pictures, but no interview. For me, it's not good enough. But in the old days, that would have been it. It was all about the picture and the image. As I said in your introduction, you've increased digital readership with Vogue by 51%. Was that a goal that you had sort of a commercial success or something that you wanted to do to change the creative landscape? I think it was just, you know, sort of, I knew initially that, you know, there's a whole new generation who would approach the magazine first through digital. You know, not everybody buys magazines, but I just knew that we had to also have a digital platform that appealed to all ages. So for me, it wasn't something that was so hard to think about. It was just like you couldn't just deal with print. And, you know, now when we want things to, you know, sort of amplify the design. digital platforms, amazing. Millions of people read it every month. I mean, I just got a note from my, from the girl in charge my digital, and we hit 7 million in January. You know, these are incredible numbers that you can't recreate with print. But at the same time, print acts as the whole couture, if you say, our, the most incredible, beautiful thing we can produce, and that sort of powers all, everything from, powers everything, I should. say, really. And you replaced Alexandra Shulman when you joined British Vogue. She is sort of an icon in her own right. Was that difficult coming and stepping into her shoes? Or do you think... I mean, Alex is a great editor. She did such a great job. I just knew that I had, she had an amazing point of view in her time. And also, I had to bring in my point of view in my time. So, yeah, she really, you know, created a great magazine and I'm glad I was able to sort of inherit it and still keep it, you know, at the level that it deserves to be. You've spoken a lot about your team and your soldiers. What do you look for in collaborators? It pretty much goes back to what I look for in, it's, you know, again, a sense of adventure and a sense of questioning and, you know, everything I said before, really. You know, I just can't, I can't do with people who are not curious about the world. You know, and people can also challenge, you know. not be scared to sort of challenge when they feel a decision is not right. At the end of the day, it's my decision, but I also love to hear what other people have to say. I think that's what really, as an editor, that's the one thing you must possess, being able to listen to everybody and through that sort of make your decisions. And what's the best piece of advice you've received in your career? Oh my God. That's a tough question. What's the best piece of advice? I've got... Yeah. Oh my God, never, I was to think. Never rest on your laurels. It's like a very old-fashioned sentence. But never rest on your laurels. Always keep going. Always keep moving. Always, you know, always keep questioning, really. But never rest on your laurels is one that I... I always go back to even in interviews. Well, thank you. I'm keen to make time for audience questions. So if you have a question, just raise your hand. just raise your hand and will have a secchi coming around with a mic? Yes, the member just over there with the, I think, black sleeve. This question is on behalf of my sister, who I told about your visit today. And she has two questions. The first is she's just asking for advice on how to stand out in the fashion industry. And her second question is, what are your predictions for? for fashion in 2022. How to stand out? Well, how to stand out? I mean, again, it goes back to the same. I always go back to the same facts. Do not lessen yourself. Do not let people say you can't, you know? For every show you don't get into, for every knockback you have, you just have to be able to stand up. You know, the fashion industry is not the easiest of industries when you're starting. I remember not having any money for years, staying on my parents' floors, returning clothes, walking, not having enough money to even get a bus. But it was something that was, if you're destined to do it, you will do it and you will stand out with your determination, you know, with the determination, definitely. So just be determined. And don't let people tell you otherwise, is really all I can say. And your predictions for fashion in 2022? Oh my gosh, you should ask my editors. By the next issue. I always go back to the same old one. I always go, you know, I believe, look, I could give you all the trends coming out of my ears, but I always believe individuality will always win. A personal sense of how to dress, a personal sense, what is fashion to you will always trump everything else, I think. And then you have like this season we did black, we did all that. But I believe in personal style. You know, Kate Moss personal style, you know. It's almost the best people have a sense of style that they hone over the years. So I really believe in that rather than saying this or that or this or that. Do you have a favorite personal style somebody that you've worked with? Is what? Do you have a favorite personal style somebody that you've worked with? Well, I always go back to Kate because we kind of grew up together from when she was a little baby model, when we met as models, she was, I think she was 14, I was 16, to seeing her evolve through the 90s, you know, sort of the minimalist, to being sort of a mother, sort of Glastonbury, you know, but I love her. I love, you know, so many people I work with. I love Rihanna's sense of style. I love Beyonce, sense. So many women, almost Zendaya, everybody I've put on the cover is because they have a certain style that I love, you know, Gaga, Adel. So basically, just you look back at the covers, Britishville covers, those are the people. sort of very inspiring and stylish. And a question from a member in the colourful jacket. Hello, my name is Mark. Hello. And the question I wanted to ask you mentioned meeting young girls who are fans of Vogue and readers of Vogue. And I wanted to ask you, what is the most moving or inso? inspiring interaction you've ever had with a Vogue reader in your career? Oh, wow. To be honest, you know, I'm so lucky it happens every day. It happened tonight when I was with all these incredible students, and it just always fills me with so much happiness, all of them just saying thank you. And, you know, just like being on a train. And the reason why I do this is not for the accolades. It's not, it's to see real women seeing themselves. in the magazine or people who've been othered seeing themselves in the magazine. So, you know, every day I do get someone sort of coming up to say thank you and it makes me a better editor. I want to say thank you for even taking that minute, taking the time to read it's like, how dare I? Who do I think I am? But taking the time to read something with creative. For me, it's so humbling. So it's not really about somebody coming up to me, but it's like me thanking them for, you know, support. in this vision which really could have gone left when I started. We'll take a question from the member at the end on the front bench, yeah. And then from the member just at the back there afterwards. So here first. Hi. Hello. So you said that part of how you choose what to include in Vogue and what to talk about was about reflecting the world. but Vogue has such a massive reach that it also plays a massive part in shaping the conversation and sometimes your covers are a bit provocative or they like challenge narratives of what people think and they've provoked reactions so like quite recent like the Billy Irish cover sparked this huge debate about does it matter what women were and what does it mean about their sexuality is there a certain reaction you're looking for when you think about how you're doing these covers and like some of your edgier stuff. Is there something you're looking for? Is it just... So I'm looking for a certain reaction. Yeah, is there a certain reaction you're looking for when you put out these covers that can be quite... No, I think, I think to think of reaction before creation, well, and I say for Billy, you know, it was a cover, and I spoke to her, and she wanted to sort of wear corsets. And so I kind of help her navigate that. reaction happens anyway, you know, but you can't start by thinking, I need this reaction because then you won't really create anything that connects with people. I think, you know, but one thing I will say is, I'm not scared of bad reactions. I'm not scared of conversation. I'm quite fearless in that way. But if I feel something is innately right and of the zeitguise, even if it's unpopular, I'll still sort of get behind it. So it's more that way of thinking than wanting to create shock or anything. But I think it's important that magazines create conversation, you know, about all these issues. Look at what happened last year. We were in lockdown. All my staff was scattered all around London. You know, we were told that, oh my God, if you're over the age of 60, basically your life is in danger. What did we do? We put Judy Dench on the cover just to show the beauty of age. And then I remember a few months later, we were all at home not knowing what was going to happen, not knowing what year we were going to have because of lockdown. And I look at my window and I'll see the nurses and my postman and the shop goes. And I thought, you know what, this is the moment to really have essential workers on the cover because these people are literally putting their lives on the line for us. And then, you know, there was a second, I thought, we need a break. So we did a series of 14 landscape covers. could at least take a deep breath. And then, of course, George Floyd happened, and the covers were activists. So what I'm trying to say is fashion has to ask the document of our time. More than shock, it has to be a document. So when you look back in, I don't know, say 10, 20 years, you'll see the year that we had. You know, you'll look at Judy Dent, you would look at the activists, and it'll be a document of the time. So that's more important to me than shock or anything. I hope that's okay. Hi, wonderful speech, by the way. Thank you very, very much. I'm also kind of a middleman here, which is kind of funny. I'm asking for our first year, LCF, shout to Petra Melanton. But I wanted to ask, what would you say to a small designer, particularly a small designer, an independent designer who wants to know what they should be thinking about now in the early days to succeed and going forward what you would consider to be important for small designers. I mean, I'll say, you know, never lose your creativity. What's happened over the past sort of a year or two that I love in terms of young designers? You know, I come from a generation where it was all about the show, wasn't it? The big fashion show, the massive cast of models. And young designers somehow, you know, couldn't fit into that fault. You know, young designers, some of them was creative people have met. You know, everything I talked about relates to a lot of young designers I know, always questioning, you know, sort of not having enough funds, but sort of working, you know, so hard. And what happened that was so interesting the past year is we couldn't go anywhere, we couldn't go to fashion shows. So we thought, you know what, let's pivot to video, right? So everybody starts making sort of videos to sort of, you know, show their collections. And then we come out of lockdown and realize, oh my God, nice. Now, the playing field is leveled a bit because if you're a young designer, you don't have the pressure to have that show. You could just have a video. You could get some friends together and put something together, whether it's on Instagram, you know, so let's not forget social media. Young designer, you know, use social media, use it. I didn't have it in my time. My time, you know, you had to wait for someone to spot you in a magazine. You have social media, so you have to be really fearless, you know, approach people, leave me messages, DM people, do all. all that because you have that at your fingertips and then hopefully somebody will see you know somebody will tell somebody and you know that's how careers are made you know so use whatever's like your fingertips really did you talk to us a bit about what you think the impact of social media has been on fashion I mean you know I mean fashion has become it's really changed fashion sometimes for the better you know the for me I said our front cover is really social media. When we launch it on Instagram, my God, the conversations it creates. But I just also feel that sometimes there needs to be people curating. You know, there's a lot of noise. And in my time, we could go in and narrow down what we wanted. So I think when you look at social media, you can't take everything as, you know, be all and end all. You have to question still. And I know it's hard. most of you have grown up with it, right? But you have to still question it and you have to still take what you need from it and the rest just becomes noise. That's a great tool of communication too, isn't it? I heard from some young photographers and stylists that now they don't even need agents because people just book them directly through social media. So they're the good size and the bad size, you know, people's mental health, and what can I say? Do you think that's an approach that British Vogue would take in the future, cutting out the agents and recruiting people directly from social media? I mean, we were doing that before. Before, you know, there were lots of interns and you could come in and go, but we knew that, you know, sort of interns, across all magazines, we're working so hard and not really sort of police. So now, you know, we have sort of strict guidelines. You come in, you know, you get paid, you. So I'm very proud about that. And also we kind of go outside of sort of the local, the normal scouting area. you know, we go to sort of inner cities and schools where people aren't so privileged and sort of try to create what we talk about, you know, diverse staff. We'll go for the member in the pink coat and then the member just on the front in the brown coat after that. Hello, I'm Kapi. And my question is, how do you deal with as a creative, you know, not allowing the commercial pressures get to you? How do you avoid the business that is fashion from... I don't know what you mean. I don't you mean. Yeah, from basically pushing the direct. you go because it is a big industry. It is a big economy itself. And as I'm Nigerian, when are we going to get a Vogue Africa? Oh, she's tough. She's tough. Look, you know, it's all about art and commerce, right? You know, there's a structure, there's a stuff. So you have to keep all that going. They have to keep advertising going. But I still believe that what we do at British Vogue and at Vogue is we do it with integrity. You know, we're still able to, to sort of have a whole commercial side and not sacrifice the creativity. You can never do that. So, you know, the balance is not always the easiest I tell you. Sometimes I'll look at an issue and go, my God, it's gone too far down an unrelatable route. And I will change it in the last minute. I will change it a week before deadline. And then other times I'm like, oh my God, it's sort of very commercial. So let's sort of, let's mix it up. And that's really that's the beauty of the job, sort of always straddling art and commerce, as I call it. And that's for Africa Vogue. Watch this space. Hello. Thank you very much for speaking to us today. My question, follow up to your question, is a little bit the opposite direction about the business of fashion. A bunch of us MBAs here started a luxury retail club in the business school here, and we think it's about time that fashion as a business taken seriously at the business industry. A bunch of us also have experience from like a banker career, finance career, and then five to ten years of career trying to pivot into a luxury industry and fashion industry. Do you have any advice to us like mid-career transitioning into fashion? What's your advice for people who are interested in the business of fashion? Yeah. Especially people who've maybe had experience in just business, transferring into the fashion industry. Yeah. Oh, I mean, you know, the, to a business of fashion. That's a magazine, but you have to sort of, again, are we talking about people who are working already or sort of young students? So this is a question from, I think, one of the sort of masters of business students. So we'll be probably working already and then come back to be a student again. Just think of like-minded people. Think of people who sort of think of people who you admire, whose vision you want to be a part of. Like I said, you can't separate art from commerce. You can't just say, I'm going to work for this business person and that's it. You have to know what a brand means. Are they sustainable? Are they inclusive? You know, once you know that, then you can make your business. decisions about the business side. Before the business was here, the industry was here, but the best businesses now are the ones who speak to each other, you know, where the CEO, look at Gucci, Marco, the businessman and the designer go hand in hand, you know, at British Vogue, my publisher, I wouldn't be able to work without my publisher, so look for companies that sort of fester that kind of a relationship and you can't go wrong, you know. Yeah. Any more questions? A question from the member in this with a furry sleeve on the front row and then we'll take a question from this member here at the back afterwards. I have one very quick question and then a slightly longer one. The quick one is, who are you wearing? Oh! Wow, it's not so exciting, I'm afraid. I always wear British, so I always wear Berberie and I'll always wear. and I'll always wear McQueen. I think this is probably, I also wear Prada a lot. But I do mix it up because, you know, this is Mr. Porter and this is Prada and my shirt is the gap. So I practice what I preach. You know, I don't do head to toe anything. And the boots are on Laurent. So, yeah, it's the stylist in me. I can't just wear one thing. Even though I look the same, I always look like I'm dressed in old black. in old black, or trust me, every day I do think about it. It doesn't look like it. And my slightly longer question is, like, how long after a movement or a trend in fashion has passed, do you need to name it? Because it seems to me that fashion is like, compared to other art forms, an incredibly immediate environment. Like, after Mark Jacobs got fired from Perry Ellis, who had, like, Susie Menke's immediately calling Grunge Garcely. and it's like she's naming it immediately in her review. And I guess like, how long do you need insofar as power dressing in the 80s, millimism in the 90s, porn chic in the naughtys, like what ism are we living through right now if we can name it? Okay. So it's... How long you need to identify... To like name a trend and name a movement. Yeah, to name the trends that we're in right now. And what ism do you think we're living through now? I see Grange and White 2K. I guess you have to wait a minute for a decade to sort of define what it is, you know. When you're living in the moment, it feels like it's very psychical, isn't it trains after train after train, after train, but you need a little time, you know. I was stuck in terms of decades and half decades somehow to really distill what happened in a period of time. So I don't think there's a specific time, but I think it's easier to think in terms of decades. You know, the seven, you know, free love in the 70s, you know, power dressing in the 80s, you know, grand in the 90s. You need a little time. Because as you're there, it's just life, isn't it? You're just living life and changing clothes and trends. So you just need a little time, maybe a decade I'll always say. And the member with the white trousers and the ferries? If you just stand, then, yeah. Thank you. There's a really great questions, by the way. You've had a really incredible career, and you've used your platform to give so many different types of people, I guess, space to share their experiences. And for that, I think we're all very grateful. But my question was more, when do you know that it's time to leave and kind of take up a new opportunity? So moving from W to British Vogue or even from Vogue Italia, when do you know that it's time to go? When do you know that it's time to leave and take up a new opportunity, move from one publication to a number? I think you know when you've overstayed your welcome at a party. It's that simple. You know when you overstayed your welcome. You know when you're no longer inspired. You know when you're just phoning it in as they say. And, you know, I'm not there yet. And I feel like when that happens, it's your duty to leave. You know, I always say Vogue is bigger than any editor. It's been here before me and it will still exist and survive when I leave. But while there you're the custodian. You know, you have to give it the voice, you have to shape it. And then when your time comes, it's like, you know, leave home, get out. And when you're working at Vogue, do you think about sort of setting it up for the next editor and that form of custodianship? Or are you focused on your vision and your story? it's like going into battle. You're focused every day on doing what you do. But like I said, when the day comes when you're no longer inspired, then you have to leave. There's no other staying welcomes. Because the reader will also see when you're bored or, you know, so it's not really about setting, but it's just about being in the moment. I believe in living in the moment. And in that moment, doing the best possible work you can, you know, and not resting. And, you know, just keep it going. And the member just at the back over here. Thanks. Hello. Hi. So the fashion industry is known as being one of the biggest polluters. And I just wanted to know there's been a lot of, obviously, shops like Boohoo or Sheehan. And I just wanted to know what you think Vogue's role in trying to promote sustainable fashion and trying to stop all of this kind of exploitation and wastage and damage to the environment is. I love that question. I'm so happy that one question, aside from inclusivity and, you know, sort of togetherness, the industry is now talking about sustainability. I think everybody realizes fashion is a polluter. Every, my last, the issue last January was, you know, a sustainable issue. You know, we featured designers from all over the world. Who don't even advertise, you probably haven't heard of, but who are working to make our world a better place. So we take that very, very, very seriously. We also work with sort of Prince Charles and his sort of his whole team, sort of dealing with sustainability. We're really questioning, you know, how to be carbon neutral. These are conversations we're having every day. And I promise we will keep having. I'm not saying I'm an expert on it. But we really, really cannot leave the world. the way it is. We have to do better. And my slogan is always, buy better, buy less, buy things that last, things that you can pass on, you know, better and less. So that's what we preach at the magazine and that's what we keep, we'll keep doing. We have time for just one or two more questions. Is that a press question on the front bench there in the white shirt or a moment's question? Perfect, then take that question. Hello. Hello. At the first glance, fashion might appear superficial in the sense that it refers to external appearance, but I still believe that fashion has a great power in the sense that it can shape our inner identity. So I was wondering what is your view on the power of fashion from an individual perspective? So fashion can sometimes be seen as quite superficial, but obviously have to be seen as quite superficial, but obviously have. power to shape some of these identities. So what's your real? Oh my God, fashion not only shapes person identity, but it also changes society. Like I said, you know, you can tell, you can tell so much through image, through images, you know, through words. You can change society and I believe fashion still does that. Fashion still has a place, you know. Fashion can talk, the reason why we're here, I'm here is fashion has been able to talk about size, about race, about religion, about age, you know, we have to tackle the topics of today more than ever, you know. And I think anybody who thinks fashion is, you know, just frivolous and, you know, it helps society so much, apart from like the personal, being in your armor, you know, it tackles so many problems and we'll continue to, especially now, you know, where we are now. It's our responsibility. No. Well, that's a perfect message to end on. I'll finish with one more question. Already we're done. I'll finish with one more question. We've been asking all of our speakers, which is if you could give one thing for all of our members to take away and think about this week, what should it be? One thing about, like I said, you know, be fearless. Because once, you know, I remember when I first got the job at British Vogue and I thought, you know, I could, I could do a copy of the magazine that's existed before. Or I could do something I really believed in, right? Had I not been fearless? And I remember saying to my team, you know, if I get fired, at least I'll get fired for something I believe in. How horrible it is to get fired for something you don't believe in. So, you know, always, you know, just be fearless and just question. Never stop questioning. Never stop asking why. when you go into an institution and they say to you, we've always done things this way, you can't, just go, why? Simple, simple. Three letters. Why can't we try this? Why is it always this way? So why, for me, always have that in the back of your mind? Well, Edward, thank you so much for joining. Thank you for having me. It's been a pleasure. No, really good. Thank you so much. Thank you.
