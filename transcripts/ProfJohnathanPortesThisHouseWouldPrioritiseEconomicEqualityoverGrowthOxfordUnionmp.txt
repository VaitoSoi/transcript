 Thank you very much and thanks very much for inviting me here tonight. I have to say, you know, because the student speakers from the floor don't have to take quite such a binary approach. Actually I had quite a lot of sympathy with what the last few speakers from the opposition said about the need for balancing. So I'm going to try and be a bit, I know you don't teach economics at Oxford, so let me be quite boring and do both a bit of theory and a bit of empiricism. First, the theory. I think it is actually, tells you something that actually, although we economists are frequently parodied as being obsessed with growth and being obsessed with GDP, the two economists here, and we're both pretty mainstream economists as it happens. are both supporting the motion. And that's because the economic tradition, the tradition of the great English and Scottish economists, Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Jeremy Bentham, that give the basis for economic theory are quite clear that growth in itself, economic output, is not the goal of a well-functioning economic system, but rather it is the maximization of social. social welfare, utility, of course, which you probably do learn about in PPA, utilitarianism, which is sort of the foundation of how we think about economics. What does that actually mean in when it comes to whether you prioritize growth or equality? Well, the sort of simple of that, if you want to maximize social welfare, you want to make as many people as possible, as well off, as satisfied with their lives, as happy as possible. So, at a very simple level, examining the motion, what is prioritizing, let's suppose that this actually, and I think last two speakers, I said, made a good point of why the motion isn't the great motion in terms of drafting, but what would it actually mean if we could shoot, so we could actually decide to prioritize between growth or inequality? Well, take a simple numerical example. We can have an economy of two people where economic output is, say, a high, hundred thousand pounds and Jaggett gets it all and I don't get anything at all. Or we have a choice, and we're not talking about policy here, we simply have a choice. We have an economy, again, with two people where Jaggett and I each get 40,000 pounds. Economy one is the one where you prioritize growth. Economy two is the one where you prioritize equality. Indeed, it could be 50-30, you'd still be prioritizing equality. Which is a better economy? Well, the problem with the first economy, obviously, is that I'm starving and homeless, and Jaggett is very happy. In the second economy, Jaggett is a bit less happy, but I'm a lot more happy with my 40,000 pounds. He's down to 40,000 pounds, but he's still doing okay. I am no longer starving. And that, at very simple level, is what simple welfare economics tells you. The second economy has lower output, but it is a higher welfare economy. It's the one that any classical economist, this is not an ideological thing, any classical economist would say that social welfare is better off in the second economy. So if you really have the choice, if what you're really talking about is prioritization, then equality, you know, this is the simple conception of the diminishing marginal utility leave income, the extra 10,000 pounds is worth more to the person who has less in the first place. Very simple tells you that equality is a priority. But what, you know, of course, and this is why the motion isn't perfect, we don't, we can't snap our fingers and choose between these two economies, what does that choice actually look like in practice? And interestingly, a couple of the speakers on the other side alluded to from a rather different, rather contradictory, in fact, the record of the last 20 or 30 years. With one saying, oh, growth sort of stopped in 2008, 2010, and since then we've had very low growth, and it's all been terrible. And, well, that's true, of course. But that's not, as he said, because we stopped prioritizing growth and started priority inequality. We've had a government for the last 10 years, which really doesn't give a damn about inequality. We know that. I, as Dan Hannan said, worked, well, I was a civil servant, I was civil servant from 1987. I worked for government for both parties. I didn't leave until 2011. But during the sort of meat of my career, I worked for a government which had as its foremost policy objective, the one objective that Gordon Brown and Tony Blair seemed to agree on, the elimination, the eradication of child poverty. And that's the single part of my life in some sense that I'm most proud of was working in that the Department of Work and Pensions. And we did indeed make it a priority. We did indeed devote a lot of policy effort, a lot of resources to doing that. And of course, it was a genuine priority. Did that harm growth? Well, no. We had higher growth then, as the speaker from the other side, quite rightly said. We had significantly higher growth then than we've had with a government which has chosen, supposedly because we needed it to restore growth to stop paying, you know, to cut benefits to people who choose to have more than two children. We had higher growth than we then than we did with the government which claims to have prioritized growth by seeking to cut taxes for. the better off. So we do have AD, we have some experience in this country of what happens when you prioritize poverty and you try and do something about equality and what that delivers in terms of both inequality and growth, and we have some experience of what happens when you do the opposite. And that is not something that is unique to this country either. We have a fair degree of empirical evidence from around the world, as Nadia said, referring to the IMF, about what is actually good for growth. So the other way of framing this question is perhaps a more sensible way, and here trying to give some credit to the opposition, is your view that you need growth, let's suppose that we both care about growth in inequality, and I think it's reasonable to say that pretty much everybody who's spoken on both sides does say that growth is good and inequality is bad. Fine. Is your prioritization, your view that you need more growth to reduce inequality, you need growth first and inequality later, or do you need to reduce inequality in order to generate growth? And I think the empirical evidence across countries of the last 30 years is pretty clear that it is the latter which matters. particularly in advanced economies in countries like the UK and US, we have found that rising inequality, failing to address inequality in all its dimensions, as Jagged said, income inequality, social inequality, education equality, these are bad for growth. So I don't think that ultimately, that if you frame the question that way, what is the priority, what do we need to do, to deliver what we all agree on, both lower inequality, higher growth, and ultimately higher social welfare for all of us, we need to start with the roots of our current malaise, and that is indeed inequality. And so reducing inequality will end up by delivering that better outcome we all want. We'll stop there. Thank you. I'm
