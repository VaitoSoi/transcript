 Thank you, Mr. President, for inviting me and the honor to be here in this walls of this chamber and be back at Oxford after almost 20 years of being here. It's bring very good memories. Well, I think it's very difficult for me as a foreign minister of a country to divide my personal opinions of the ones of the country I represent, but nevertheless I will try to do my best in order of the freedom of speech of this house. For countries like Honduras, a very small country with a small economy, the situations of the international arena and the crisis directly hits on us. It's like environmental problems. We don't provoke them, but we face hurricanes and we face natural disasters. We don't provoke the wars in Ukraine, but we face the higher price of food, the higher price of fuel, the highest price of many of the matter is very important for development. So like that, in an international system that is related with the relation of international financial organization or international financial organization, organizations. I think there is many inequalities, as the President speak before. I'm not an expert in economy or finance, but as a foreign minister, we face the realities of a country that we have to deal with large countries and large relations in order to put forward some of the issues that are related directly to our financial institutions or lending or to. face poverty or change. For example, in the UN, you have the system, as you mentioned, one vote, one country. In the financial institution, it's not the same. It depends on the power of the votes, of the large economies, where you decide of a lending, of a project in many of the developing banks, either the IDB, the American Development Bank, the IMF, or the World Bank. Take the case of Honduras. We might say it's not the related issue of not only Western lenders, because, for example, Honduras is one of the few countries in Latin America that keep a relation with Taiwan. So we are facing really Western lenders. In Honduras, we faced a good attack in 2009. It's true. We might say this is a balance. a difficult balance between is the responsibility of our own countries or the responsibility of the Western lenders. But as we spoke before with one of the speakers, we might say it's 6040, probably against the Western lenders. Why? Because in Honduras, for example, after the coup, we have a very corrupt government that didn't have the opportunity to lend from international financial institutions, because there was a blockage against the coup government, but they start to lend from private banking in Honduras. And we rise from a debt for $3 billion to $20 billion in 20 years. Right now, half of the income that we get from taxes in our country is directed for the service of the debt. The other half, we have to deal between saving our own national energy company that is kept like a black hole sucking all of resources and what to bring to the people in social investment, in health and economy and education. So it's very difficult to bring those investments. Right now we have nine months in government, our government had nine months in office. It's the first female president in Honduras with a huge amount of, of votes, historic votes in the elections, and historic hope of the Honduran people. So we have to deliver in many issues, as I mentioned, in health, in social justice. We come from a pandemic. We come from two hurricanes that hit us in 2020. And we tried to bring all this investment in social issues, but we have to negotiate with the IMF. we have to negotiate with the World Bank. And after that, we have the shock of the world in Ukraine. With that, for example, the MS. Tell us, you have to increase your interest rates to prevent inflation. You have to devaluate your currency to prevent inflation. Nevertheless, our government has taken steps to subsidize energy and to subsidize fuel prices that skip our inflation to a 10% that is very good for Latin America. But to get this approval of the IMF, we have to change that. And we are talking to the IMFSA, you have to be more flexible. You have to understand the reality of Honduras, because with that, we will not be able to invest any scent in the Honduran people. So I think that we live in a very unjust economic and financial system, very unequal that has provoked many problems, particularly in Latin America, have provoked more poverty, and as our president, Simara Castro explains, is a system that is a factory of poverty for us. So we have to change that. I think, like in the UN, we have to develop an organization that is more democratic, that is more open, because at the end, you keep the five powers of the Security Council that have the power of the veto. So not all the countries are the same within the UN. And like that, in the international financial institution, the power of the economic contributions to institutions make the power of the vote. So we think that all the situation that many of our institutions, that many of our institutions, we have country has faced in all through these years in Latin America, for example, you have the case of Argentina, you have the case of Mexico, you have the case of many of the countries that have faced a default and are changing this. I think probably like the cases of Honduras, we are not directly right now have problems with the IMF or the World Bank because probably the dead that we have with these institutions is not very very much. high. Our problem right now is the private banking institutions, not only the national institution, but the relation with them with international banking system, either in the US or the UK or the European countries. So I think that the situation for us has really to put forward to change. We don't have the IMF says a new IMF, so we expect that really becomes a new IMF. We had a meeting with the management director of the IMF, and we explained the situation of Honduras can go forward. And the expectatives of the Honduran people are very high. We are having a large problem with immigration of the Honduran people. Many of the Honduras are leaving the country because they don't feel hope to understand and to feel how to develop a new capabilities for their own future. So I understand that this has to change, as I mentioned. There have been policies that have been put into place sometimes ago, like the SHIPC initiative for highly in-depth countries. Honduras had been part of that, and we have an alleviation program of the debt. But nevertheless, as I mentioned, the system changed in itself. So right now, the private institution are subtracting many of our, or debt. And when we try to talk about the financial institutions to buy that debt in order to give better conditions to our debt, that is the lending, higher interest rates and everything, we get the situation. We might not have to talk of reconversion of debt because it's a bad word within the financial rate international institution because you are going to lower your risk-related internationally. So you will not have the possibility to lend more from other institutions. Another is the tighter fiscal policies. You don't have the opportunity to lend more than an amount. So it's very difficult. And we have to face also many problems. And I'd be very clear. I think we have been very clear that it is responsibility as countries. We know that sometimes we have corruption, sometimes we have other issues. But also, we have a lot of the issues. But also, we have a Also, I think that the international financial institution represent interest. In the case of Honduras, these 12 years of a corrupt government, where the former Honduran president is right now dealing an accusation and has been extradite to the U.S. because he has dealing with a drug-related state and is now facing accusations in New York, this financial institution has led him doing what he wants because politically is one. was important the situation and the position of that government related to other political issues in Latin America, like Venezuela, like Cuba or Nicaragua. So sometimes you find these double standards in the international financial institutions. There are more related to political issues than financial issues. So I think we might say as our proposition that the Western lenders are responsibly of the plight of developing countries. Thank you very much.
