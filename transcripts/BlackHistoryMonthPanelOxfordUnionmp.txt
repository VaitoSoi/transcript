 What does it mean to be black and British in the modern world? In this Black History Month panel, we hope to explore the role of Black British community in the foremost industries such as education, entertainment and business. Black Britons contribute so much to popular culture, vernacular language and the British economy. But how does this appreciation manifest in the professional sphere? How best can we value the lived experiences of black people in managerial roles on our screens and in business? Some have argued that in effort to promote a display of diversity, he plays across a range of industries have fallen into mere tokenism rather than meaningful inclusivity. Do successful Black Britons feel like trailblazers in their own rights, taking charge of their narrative and setting precedence for others or agents in a neo-colonial act of white savourism? How can Black Britons become ubiquitous, appreciated and wholly welcome in all aspects of professional life. Joining me are two speakers who I'm very pleased to welcome, Valerie Amos, who is a Labour Party politician and diplomat, the 8th Under Secretary General for Humanity and Affairs at the UN, and Master of University College, Oxford. Also joining me is Big Zoo, a British rapper and songwriter, known for his hits such as B-I-G and Blatant Truth. He's also a TV presenter and stars in Big Zoo's Big Eats. Please join me welcoming Valerie Amos and Big Zoo. So, guys, welcome. It's a pleasure to have you here at the Union. And yeah, I'm really excited for our discussion today. So I'll start off with my first, first question. So what does Black History Month mean to you? Hello everyone. Gang, we're inside, you know the vibes. Black kissing up, I don't know. It reminds me of being in school, because it was so important in school. So when I was in school, I remember I had a, my head of year woman called Sharon Andrews. Very powerful black lady. She was in Commonwealth games doing shot put. So, can I swear? I can't swear, aren't it? Can I swear? No. Oh, shit. Ha ha, I'm joking. Basically, you would have mess with Ms. Angie's, and she took Black History, but very seriously, so I'm very lucky that in my curriculum and stuff, I got to learn a lot about Black history, but we also, I felt like growing up I learned a lot about the pain and the struggle, so it's kind of nice to see the conversation change towards, like, more positive role models and people that do good things within black culture and the world, rather than just being about learning about slavery in the past, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I really agree. Like, I think there's so much, there's so much that we can. can learn from like you know the different empires and like across Africa and like so much history and culture that that's available to us to understand but yeah turning it to you valeramos what does black history month mean to you um i suppose uh also good evening everyone um i suppose for me it's partly about shining a spotlight on um history which is unrecognized uh i think it's about celebrating the contribution that um black people and black culture have made to Britain. I think it's about trying to promote greater inclusiveness and in that sense, whilst I think it's important to shine that spotlight, I think that this is something that we should be doing as a matter of course. So, yes, Black History Month, but I think that ensuring that our curricula are more inclusive, I mean, all of those kinds of things is something that we should be doing all the time. It shouldn't just be about month. Yeah, I agree. I want to turn our attention to education and aspirations. So obviously, you, Big Zoo, you're half Sierra Leone and half Lebanese and Valerie, you came from British Guyana. And so obviously when you came to the UK, there was a lot of tensions between races and obviously in the wider context of the civil rights movement. And obviously growing up in London as well, there's a lot of, you know, in West London There's a multicultural area and there's so many different people mixing in the melting port. Did you experience any issues growing up and how did you face these challenges? Well, whilst you could say that I grew up, as it were, in suburbs London, you know, I grew up just into Kent. So the kind of South East London, Kent. We were the first black family in the... the area that we moved to. This was in the 60s. People hadn't seen, a lot of people just hadn't seen a black person. And there wasn't much on television either. So there was a huge amount of curiosity. People wanting to basically touch our hair, our skin. I mean, it was saying uncomfortable is, kind of dials it down a bit, actually. you know, you're a child. You don't understand the curiosity that people have about you. There was an attempt, you know, to ensure that my parents didn't buy their first house. One of the neighbours tried to get a petition up, but the majority of the neighbours wouldn't sign it. And I think what really, what was important for us was that my parents were very first. about helping us to understand our history where we had come from, helping us to challenge when we came home from school and we've been told nonsense. And making sure that we stayed connected so we would go and see family and friends in places in London, make sure that we were able to eat the kind of food so that we could say stay connected to culture. And that's really, really important. And like, how do you think that, you know, as black people, especially in the UK, we can really stay connected with our culture? Like how, what ways do you think that, like, we can improve our connections? Because it can be quite difficult, especially, like, I think, growing up in, well, living in Oxford, you know, college food is not the best sometimes. But yeah, how do you think, I mean, this goes out to both of you, really. What are the ways in which you've managed to embrace your Sierra Leone heritage, your Lebanese heritage, yeah, in actual life? I mean, I think growing up was a bit different. Like being African wasn't that cool in school. And like growing up in London, you know, you grew up speaking like Jamaican dialect, listen to Caribbean music, eating Caribbean food. Like it was normal to eat rice and peas in my area. But eating Joloff was like, what? We talk about Jolov. But I was very proud of my roots. growing up. My mom's a very like, mom's a very loud, over-the-top woman. So she would force everyone in my school to eat Joloff. So I was really lucky that growing up, like being Sierra Leone and I was able to embrace that. But my peers, my friends around him, like, I know people would lie when they would say, like, where are you from, I'm from Jamaica? What do you mean you're from Jamaica? You're not from Jamaica, but we're from Nigeria, do you know what I mean? That's what it was like growing up though. And then I feel like now it's a bit different because, you know, African culture is taking over the world in terms of music, in terms of, in terms of, like, acting, in terms of just that overall impact of Africa has become so much bigger. But growing up for me, it was weird, like, to resonate with other people being in Sierra Leone. I used to speak Creole to people that were from Seleone and they'd be like, what you're talking about? You know what I mean? And their first generation, I'm like, how do you not know your mother tongue, you know what I mean? But it was normal, but now I feel like we're embracing ourselves more and we've got role models doing things to make people feel a bit more inclusive. Yeah, man. It's one of them that's like growing up in London, that's where it's like. Yeah, you spoke about Romans, and I just went to like... Can I just say something about the culture piece before you go into Romans? Yeah. Because I think that, I certainly think that there is... There is a lot more that we can relate to in terms of different cultures than there was when I first came to this country. I mean, I came from Guyana, nobody said that they were from Guyana. It was the same thing, you know. Black culture was Caribbean, Jamaican. And I think over time that has really shifted and that it has been, it's much more recognisable that people come from different parts of the world and that there is a contribution that those cultures make. But your point about how then do you stay connected with that, particularly if you move out of, well, either if you don't live in a metropolitan area or if you move. out of a metropolitan area somewhere else, it's really hard. I think you have to connect up with other people. I think find ways of getting together, celebrating, you know, food, music, whatever it is. And I think that over time that becomes much more, others want to engage with that. but I have a particular thing about a place like Oxford and Oxford University, which is I think the work that we do around access and opportunity and so on is fine, but what I want for students of colour when they come to Oxford is that they are not required to adapt to the culture, that the culture begins to adapt to having different people in the university, so that the culture of Oxford University becomes more inclusive. And that's where I think we need to be where I think we need to be heading. And part of that is about, yes, the kind of food that is served in our different colleges, the kinds of assumptions that are made in relation to the way that life is lived in our colleges. So I think we have to aspire to that. I think I really agree with that, especially like talking about coming into a situation where you feel like you don't belong and trying to keep your identity in that situation. And I do kind of want to touch on that because you mentioned about all of that coming into this new arena. And I just wanted to point out some of the things that you've done in your life and how you kind of dealt with that feeling there. So in 2003, you appointed a Secretary of State for International Development. you were the first Bain woman cabinet minister. In 2015, you appointed director of the School of Oriental and African Studies, the first black woman to leader university in the UK. And obviously in my year of matriculation, 2020, you were appointed of head of UNIF, University College and the first black head of an Oxford college. And I think I certainly relate with the feeling of, you know, being in Oxford, being the first person from my area to come to somewhere like here, and, you know, feeling like I'm representing my people. And if I fail, then I'm failing them. How did you cope with that feeling? And both of you, in fact, dealing with being a presenter, you know, you're from Mozart Estate. How did you feel like in terms of the pressure from people back home and doing them proud? You go. presenter. I mean, I guess, yeah, I feel like working in the entertainment industry, coming from music, which is very like multicultural, very mix-up, you have a lot. people from different backgrounds doing really well. So going into television, when I transitioned into becoming a TV host and a TV chef, the space is very different. Whereas my peers was Dave and Stormzy and AJ Tracy. I'm going into a space where it's Gordon Ramsey, Jamie Oliver, Michelle Rue. So it completely changes. And I guess when I first got into the space, it was very like, you have imposter syndrome, you're like, why am I here? Do I deserve to be here? Do I deserve to be in these places? But I feel like over the past three years what we've done with Big Eats and what we've done being in the kind of like television space, winning the two BAFTAs, kind of like just the things that we've been able to accomplish with the show has proven that we're not here for no reason and what we're doing for telly is opening so many doors to other people and kind of like now my main thing is less about having black people on telly and having black people having different people on telly it's more about having people that come from working class backgrounds working in television behind the screen so we can create more conversations because i was very lucky that i joined the team um who were predominantly white people from different backgrounds to me but we're able to come together and create a show that has helped so many people but not everyone's going to get that lucky so i feel like there's there needs to be more people behind the screens to embrace us when we come like when there's more talent coming on to telly it's great it's great seeing mold a comedian do things big nasty AJ presenting stuff and Maya Jammer becoming the Love Island host, all that stuff, sick because we're in the space. But if the crew is still just the same people that have been working in forever, how are we going to change that narrative? That's kind of my main focus now, is how that I get more people of colour, people from work across backgrounds into the production, I tell you. Yeah, I like how you spoke about that, because I mean, obviously, AJ Tracy was here a few days ago and he spoke about, well, he spoke in the context of education and saying, how like when it's good enough getting people here, but the main thing that we need to focus on is supporting them while they're here as well. And what do you think these big TV companies and production companies can do to support working class people in the field, or support black people in the field as well? It's more about access. So I work with a charity called Youaf, the Young Urban Arts Foundation, and for my last series of Big Eats, we let them bring a young person down to set to come and see what we're doing. behind the scenes and that's a decision that I made like as a 26 year old man that doesn't own the production company, doesn't run the channel but why do I why do why do I have to make that decision that we should have someone to come for access why can't someone who's older me more why is someone that's been working in the game and he can see the change make that decision do you know I mean and from that what was really interesting is that nine times out of ten when people get access or industry access or apprenticeships or them kind of things, you always work on the lowest level of what you can do so you're probably a runner, probably making someone a coffee, XYZ, which can give you access but you're not getting any insight into what you want to do. So what we thought was important was when we brought this young person on to set that there was shadowing different types of people so she was able to work with the directors, the camera ops, work with production, then she started working with the editing team and she walked in wanting to be talent, she wanted to be a presenter, but when she left after the series, she wanted to become an editor. So she never would have had that insight into becoming an editor. You know what I mean? I'll start just telling her you be a runner and go get me a kick at, which is what they normally do. When they want to make access into telly, they're like, a lot of people, you ask them in telly, how did you get into telly? What do you do to get here? 9,000 I tend to show you there was a runner. They built, they worked their way up to become an executive producer, the head of a da-da-da-da. But not everyone's going to have that access. Not every young person who's never worked in a telly in life is going to get a random job to become a runner to eventually become an exec one day. So we need to start shadowing positions and be like, why don't you work with this exec from this channel for a couple of days? Why don't the head of BBC do X, Y, Z? Why don't the ITV lot do? And I feel like they're getting there slowly. They're slowly getting there, but there's so much needs to be done. And I just feel like it needs to come to the forefront. I agree. And I think as a lawyer, well, as an aspiring lawyer, I studied law here at Oxford. I think when I started my degree, I felt very shoehorned to a very specific set of options. So for me, like when I came, it was very much corporate was the only kind of way you could go up. And I think obviously I'm not trying to go into the media space, but I think you can very much extrapolate that principle and apply it into this scenario. And speaking on to that, I want to say. Can I just come back on the same point? I couldn't agree more about the important of transforming industry. Too often you will get, you know, one or two black faces and we are supposed to be satisfied with that. And that's not necessarily where the power lies. You have to look at who makes the decisions, who has the money, the resources, you know, who recruits talent and everything else. And it doesn't just apply, you know, to the television industry or entertainment. It applies in education too. I mean, And if you look at the pipeline of black British academics, it's tiny. You know, there's a huge, and yet this is education, and you would think that education would be at the forefront of some of this. So there is a huge amount of complacency still, you know, despite the work that has been done. And a huge amount of challenging that has to be done, as well as building those pipelines that will transform industries. And on your question about, you know, do you feel the weight, when you're the first, do you feel the weight of having to do well because you're representing, you know, an entire community? Of course there's a degree of that weight, because what you don't want to do is to fail, for people to ask questions, for people to close off opportunities, because you are seen as representing an opportunity. So that is an additional pressure that individuals have to face. It's not fair, but it is a reality. Any time that you're the first and you're a pioneer, whoever you are, maybe a woman, a black woman, black man, the first in a certain kind of job, a first in an industry, but there are also advantages to it, which is what I say to people, because you have an opportunity to do this in a particular kind of way, to do it differently, not to do it in the way that it has been done before, which in and of itself can help to open up those opportunities as well. The thing that I say to young people all the time is, do not be afraid of power. The people with power make decisions. They can transform society. forms societies. So, you know, there are ways in which we can do that in ways which are positive. You don't have to do it in the same way that people have done before you. The number of times I've been, you know, I've gone into a job and I'm told that my predecessor didn't do it like that. Well, fine. I mean, we don't all have to do a job in a particular kind of way. So there are opportunities as well as the weight of feeling that you're there representing a lot of people because you want to open the door you don't want just to open an inch you want the door to be flung open and for people to be able to come in after you yeah and um speaking of that um so you know a lot of people when they um go into these careers for the first time so like they're the first person from their family to go to waksford they're the first person from i don't know a sex background to break into corporate law to break into finance or or things like that especially when we spoke about earlier in terms of making these places more accessible and more accepting of them. What would you say to people who feel like they have to adjust themselves to suit that character, well, to suit that environment? So, you know, some people code switch, some people are, you know, afraid to do certain styles with their hair. You know, we have the halo code now. And these things are very, very, like, important ways of expressing yourself. What would you say to those people who, you know, feel like they can't express themselves in order to get to where they want to be? tough. I mean, I see it a lot. Like, I see a lot of people I know that work within the industry that I work in and I've had to suppress certain sides of their personality or the way they express themselves to be acceptable in a workplace. That happens in everything. That's like a societal issue. I feel like when you're talent, so they call me talent in TV, that's what we are, like people that present or whatever, you're called talent. And as talent, we're allowed to kind I'd be unapologetic within ourselves. So I'm allowed to walk in a room and be like outlandish or whatever I want to do. But I feel like it's hard for me to ask people to apply that same kind of like principle to themselves when they were in work because that might miss them out on the opportunity. Like I did a shoot the other day and there was a woman that was the AD, the first AD, she was a black woman. She was very assertive. She was very critical with her time. She made sure we did everything correct. She was on point. She was very vocal. But I knew that with her doing her job, there was people that would look her and give her that same scope as the angry black woman. Do you understand? But she's actually doing the job where you have to be the loud person that actually communicate through the director with the team, make sure we tell everyone to be quiet in the room. That's what AD does. But when it's an older white man doing that, that doesn't come to my mind. But when she was doing it, I thought that myself. I thought that's what people are going to think of her. So sometimes it's like, you can even be yourself, you can do your job, and you'll still get that stigma regardless because just because of how society has put that on you. So I feel like in terms of approaching things, you have to be unapologetic. You can't care, but the problem of not caring is that sometimes that can spite you. So it's this continuous, you're always evolving with that. I don't feel like you have one approach. You're consistently changed. Sometimes I used to walk in the room, I'll bill a spliff and sit down and boom, yeah, I'm the rapper, this is how I move. And then sometimes I go into a commission meet, when I'm talking about a show and I can't be that. I need to shake everyone's hand and be respectful and be formal. But then sometimes when I'm doing that, I'm like, my sacrifice and who I am, so it's a continuous. The battle don't stop and I don't feel like you're ever right. You just have to like do what's natural to you. If people accept you who you are, that's great. And if they don't, well, they need more of us in the industry, so they can't fire us right now. I think we do show different sides of ourselves in different places, not just in the workplace. I mean, we're doing our families too, and depending on whether we're in a social situation or a business situation. I think where it becomes a major problem is there are certain kind of industries. And you talked about corporate law, for example. If you look historically at some of the big law firms or some of the big financial institutions, it wasn't just about being a black. person in that, well, first of all, we weren't present really, but it wasn't just about being a black person or being a woman. You know, it was very circumscribed and those industries have changed over time and I have no doubt that they will change again going forward. But I think the really difficult thing is if you are feeling that you are having to suppress things that are really important in terms of who you are and what you're about in your working environment, It's not going to help you to fly. I mean, I remember when I was coming through, a lot of women didn't talk about their families, they didn't talk about whether they had children or not, they didn't talk about whether they had, you know, a partner or a husband or not, because there was just this sense that if as a woman you talked about your home situation, your colleagues would think about you differently, you differently and yet the men would always you know the senior men would have a picture of their family in the corner of the desk the you were judged in a different way and I I think we're still judged in different ways but I think that there is a degree more consciousness about that now than there was in the past it doesn't necessarily mean it's gone far enough I also think that we as individuals need to know exactly what bottom line is because you should not go below your bottom line in a way which is destroying you. I'll give you an example. I used to wear enormous earrings, right? They don't work on television. So it's not even that somebody had to tell me not to wear these great massive earrings. They distracted the viewer when I was trying to make a point on television. serious point on television. So I started to wear smaller earrings, you know, I've still got my big earrings but I very rarely wear them. But that was a decision that I made because I wanted when I started appearing on television to be taking seriously. I didn't want people to be staring at my earrings, I wanted them to be listening to what I was saying. I don't think that that takes away from the essence of me. And I just want to carry on from that. So we talked to you spoke about people feeling like they have to suppress their identity to get to the top. What about when they actually are at the top? You guys have both made huge moves in your respective careers and you know you're both beacons of inspiration and you know part of black history. What are you guys doing to you know hand over the baton and you know like what you think others in your position as well could do to kind of encourage people, you know to beat themselves in these careers and to you know express their true identity as their as they're going to the top? I think it's very subtle. In the stuff that I do, I guess sometimes just being present is enough. Just being a voice, going on Sunday brunch and just being able to be a normal chef and going in different spaces and being able to present in different ways. Like when we did the BAFTAs, we got nominated for the first BAFTA after our first season and we was in COVID, so we couldn't go to the ceremony. we had a little, like, we had our own ceremony that we could do with COVID rules and that stuff. We lost, we had a party, it was really fun. And then when the second one came, man, because it was in person, it felt like really important that the clothes that we wear represented who we were. But then obviously you have to dress smart. So we were like, we'll just go Stone Island and get bare Stoney's. When we did it, everyone's like to us, what are you doing? Why don't you just wear a suit? Because it was really weird. We kind of knew that if we was to win, if we was to do anything, us being in a. the Stone Island jacket will kind of make people understand that you can do these things and you don't have to be like everyone there. So everyone there was suited and booted, looking real smooth. I came in a bright yellow, Stone Island and I was very hot, sweating for it the whole day but I don't care because when I won, I remember Mo Gilligan walked past me. Mo Gilligan, he's one, he's one Baftus as well, he's a very big inspiration for me. Mo, the comedian, he walked past me. I was sitting on the side of the, in the, in the, in the, in the hall so I was on the edge and he was walking down to go to a front row and he's up to me bro why he wearing a stony jacket I was like because I am he's like he was in a nice suit looked all fresh and dapper and he's like to me why are you in a stony and I remember I was that to him because I am oh you know what I'm saying he questioned it even though he knows what man's mission is but in the time he was like to me what you doing why don't you why are you in a nice suit why are you in a stone island jacket and then when we won I remember people telling me like Why did you do that? And I'm like, why not? Why can't man win these big prestigious things and be in the clothes that man? I should have been in a tracksuit. I wish I was in a track suit. But I wasn't. I'd wore the suit charges to make people happy. But yeah, I think that's kind of like, just an example of times when you know you're about to do something that's really important. Subtle, subtle things that make you who you are, it has a ripple effect on other people. and going into the chef space, working in, like, food and stuff coming from music, I've definitely seen that impact on that. Even like when I say halal on TV, I get, like, hella aunties DMing me, like, oh my God, you said halal. You said, mashallah. Like, they can't believe it because then they're able to go to their kids and be like, look, we're showing you these important words within Islam, and you've got this young man saying it on telly. And I never knew how important that was. I'm just talking about the food, but then you see the ripple effects or stuff like that, yeah. I completely agree with that. I also think that part of this is about showing our more rounded selves because people see, you know, people tend to think about me in quite a one-dimensional way. They think about me somebody who has, you know, been successful. They never think that you've had setbacks, that you cry like other people, that you like dancing, which I do. So finding ways of showing a more rounded self, particularly as you can, more senior I think is important as well as opening those doors and you know mentoring young people you know my sister and I set up a charity which supports young people of African and Caribbean origin to get to university and then crucially to stay at university because sometimes that experience is so challenging an alien and then to go on to get good jobs afterwards so there are a range of things that I think we can each do playing to our strengths. And yeah, speaking of that, I want to now move on to pioneers and role models. So obviously you mentioned that Moogu was a source of inspiration to you. We also spoke earlier about how, you know, it wasn't cool to be an African and I definitely, definitely understand that feeling growing up as well. And like music has been a huge part of like me, in fact, accepting my own identity as a Nigerian. There's a Nigerian, I'm an ebo guy. You know, and there's artists such as like Burn a boy, there's a whiskier, there's all these people who've made like huge music and he's made me very proud to be who I am. So who do you think of the current pioneers in the black community and who are like carrying the torch for the future generation? But they're everywhere. I mean, I don't think it's just about identifying people who as it were have a name. I mean, there are so many young people working in their communities, on, you know, projects, caring about a particular issue. You know, so we know about the work that Marcus Rashford has done, for example, on, you know, the importance of children being able to get a good meal and that being supported by government. But there are lots of people doing that kind of work, you know, young women doing work on, you know, violence, against women, for example, in their communities. So I think the pioneers are everywhere. And what we need to do is recognize the work that they're doing. And I think sometimes when they come and ask for advice, help them to connect with each other so you don't feel that you're doing this work on your own. No, I definitely agree with this. There's a lot of people in the community doing different things, whether it's working with young people coming out of prison services. I know a lot of friends that work within that. I got a lot of friends that do a lot of stuff in terms of outreach. I'm from West London where Grenfell happened. So a lot of my friends work with Grenfell Athletic, working on outreach with them. So those are the people that definitely agree that you can shine a light on them. But you also have your front runners. I was with Leshanna Lynch recently. We did the Graham Norton show together and watching her speak about the importance of what she does. She just did Woman as King with Rwanda Davis and stuff, representing Jamaica and what she's done in terms of being the first female bond, being a black woman. People like that, you know, they fly down in Kaluwa, all their man there. You're seeing what they're doing for the community and in terms of raising aspirations and where they come from, and it's beautiful to see, but I think it's important what you said in terms of like the other people that are doing, other things that might not be in mainstream, because that's just as important and we need to rise them up. That aspirational point is really important too. There is so much negativity about our community and so much presentation of us as victims. I think changing that narrative, talking about aspiration, opening up avenues for success are really important as well. Brilliant. Yeah, I want to thank you guys both for speaking today. This is obviously a very, very special topic to me, and I'm really, really glad that you guys could be here to discuss with. I want to open up the floor for questions for the panellists. So if you have any questions, please raise your cards or your hands, and I'll call on you to ask questions. Yeah, I'll just go. Oh sorry, I'm going to say no one day I'm one day a week in the Maths Institute at the moment as a their entrepreneur in residence by I was an undergraduate here a long time ago but historically we've been a nation of immigrants and you know and I'm just wondering in Oxford with its long history where there's any lessons to be learned that can sort of lay out now sort of when the Huguenots came over or something like that and also whether there's any lessons we learned about other minority groups? You know, is there a specialness about blackness that's different to other minority or is it the same lessons to be learned across all groups? I think there are certain core lessons to be learned from people who have migrated into a country or into a community. But remember that the migration happens at different points in history. So I think it's quite difficult to say that it's it's all the same. I think the most important thing is actually to recognise that there is a history to build on. Because part of the challenge is that we don't actually know that there is a history to build on. That there is a... You know, we kind of know about some of the biggest waves of migration into Britain. So, you know, we know generally about wind rush. We know a bit about the post... the sort of second World War migration from Jewish communities from parts of Europe, for example. But we don't know about some of the migrations that preceded that, or indeed some of the migrations that have come after. You know, people who have come from conflict-torn, you know, Somalia or Sudan to Britain. So, you know, this understanding more about that history, the challenges and difficulties those communities face, why people have settled in certain parts of Britain, you know, because that might be where, you know, one or two people from the community originally went to. You know, just explaining the geography of our country. I think all of that is absolutely fascinated and, you know, that you'll know that there's a kind of, you know, Black Oxford project which is about shining a spotlight on the history in Oxford and the contribution that black people made to Oxford and there'll be other projects like that and this is about an addition to our understanding it's not about taking away from who we are and what we're about it's about embracing that wider understanding of how Britain has grown how Britain has you know, how Britain has become much more economically successful on the back of those waves of migration. I mean, I feel like you hit it there, but I mean, I'm Lebanese, yeah? So we're all over the world, like literally, in Australia, massive community, people eat shawarma all day. In Brazil, there's more Lebanese people in Brazil than they are in Lebanon. I was in Colombia recently and I flew to an island of Colombia called San Addres which is like it's off Katerna it's pretty far and when I was on San Addres there was a Lebanese restaurant and I was like what the hell it's doing it and it was a mixture of Caribbean, Spanish, Lebanese food and it was super when I sitting there I was like we've come fire now all my people are out here but we I feel like In terms of migration, what migration does, coming from West London, I definitely, I'm so impacted by the people that have come to this country, because it's the reason why I do my job. It's the reason why I can talk about Korean food, I can talk about food from Romania. Why do I know about food from Bucharest? Because I'm around people from there. Why don't know food about, why don't I know Somalian food? Because I can go to a local Somalian restaurant in Shepherd's Bush. Do you know what I mean? Like, why are we so connected to Turkish food? because I can go north London, I can go green lanes, and eat some of the best Turkish route in the world. But I'm in London, so I feel like it kind of creates the fabric of what we're, but we come from. But being London centric, sometimes when you go up north and you see different influences, I'm always going to talk about stuff from like the lens of food, because I feel like food connects us all. Like up north in like Middlesbride, they've got a thing called a chicken palmer. They call it chicken pormar, but it's a parma. It's a deep-fried chicken breast with tomato sauce. and then they put cheese. It's a very Italian dish, but it's actually a massive dish in, like, Middlesbrough, Newcastle. They love it. And there's no connection to Italy. They just like deep-fried chicken. But it's so crazy that it's such an Italian dish that they make, but it's actually connected. It's synonymous with northern culture. So I feel like things like that are beautiful. The more we can embrace that. Like I live in Gold is Green. I was talking about this earlier. I live in Golders Green. I live in the Orthodox Jewish community. I'm Lebanese. My name is Zahar. Like, I am literally, they're pity me of what we think in terms of the community, in terms of we think of relations between Islam and Judaism. Like, I defeat that. I turn off my neighbors light on Sabbath, because they can't turn off their light on the Sabbath X-Wan said, I have to turn off their light. But like, we live in harmony. Like, I'm the only non-Jewish person on my road, and it's completely fine. And I feel like that's the essence of like the UK and what's so beautiful about it. So the more we can focus on that, more we can like, use that to inspire us and what good things can happen. Any other questions? I recognise that number. My question is about since 2020, the United States. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Thank you. Please tell us where you are. Oh, I don't know. My question was just about anti-racism and how it's been a great to push for that since you like to sit 2020. And all you guys think about how more can you deal into promote people who are not in the back community to be more as a racist and promote things like stopping more difficult with racism that we've facing like progressions and stuff? Hmm. I mean, yeah, ever since 2020 things have definitely changed. We've seen the way people react to things. I've been speaking about racism since I was a young, a young man, very vocal. about it. And my mum, black Sierra Leone women, she used to always tell me, just be quiet, stop talking, just leave it. Why are you worrying? She used to always say, why are you worrying? We're here, get on with them. That's what my mom used to always say to me. And I used to be like, mom, but there's certain things going on. Now, when I used to get comments about my hair, I remember when they told me, I was in school that I need to cut your afro, I said, why? I said, because you need to. My mom cut my hair. Do you know what I'm saying? Just so there's no argument, just so she can't argue with them. And I remember 2020, when, when, when, when, When George Floyd passed away, my mum actually sat there, she looked at me, she said, I get it now. She said, I get it. I actually get it. When she started seeing people, the way people reacted, stuff with BLM, all that stuff. It really resonated with her because she realised all the subtle things mum was talking about, all the stuff that we were saying, the depression, X, Y, said she kind of felt it in that moment. And I felt like it woke up a lot of people. And ever since then, you've seen the reaction, you've seen the Premier League what they do before every game, they take a knee, and you've seen, like, Channel 4 did black to front, where they did a whole, whole week of programming where it was only black led and there was only black people behind the camera so you see these things have had an impact but I think now it's more about like challenging that to be a thing like you said where it's not just about it's not just about race and moving black people's about races women society building on that and thinking how can we how can we continue this without people having to lose lives for us to care like Chris Kaba passed away recently in police because of because of the police and you've seen the reaction to that and it's like do we have to wait for these moments for us to have a say and sometimes it's a sad cycle but hopefully we'll see i feel like we're i feel like we're going towards a good place and i feel like things are being less accepted now so we'll see i think it's very mixed um i mean i really worry about the kind of growth of the culture wars and the um the kind of denial of the reality of the impact of racism on our society, on everybody, and the impact of our history and our history of imperialism and colonialism and the lack of kind of teaching of that history, the impact that it has on our young people. So I think, you know, this whole movement, which we have seen, scene, which is about denying the reality of that history and the contribution that it's made to who we are today, I think, is a major, major challenge. So I think whilst on the one side, as a result of Black Lives Matter, the death of George Floyd, that there is greater awareness, I think how we build on that awareness and how we challenge this whole kind of move and shift. to which is to say, you know, we're sort of over all of that. You know, our society has moved on, everything is okay. Well, it's not. You know, if you look at what is happening in our institutions, you talked about the police, you know, the new commissioner of the metropolitan police in the last couple of days has been talking about the fact that, you know, there are officers in the metropolitan police that should not be there. Part of that is, you know, not just about race. It's also about how women have been treated, about domestic violence, violence against women more generally. But, you know, we can't push these things under the carpet. So I think how we really have a conversation, which is about the fact that this affects all of us, this is not an issue for black people to raise. You know, always everybody's looking to us. We have to raise these issues much more broadly as a society. and have an honest conversation about them in my view. Thank you guys. I think that's all we have time for. I want to thank you guys for joining us and thank the audience for being so great. But yeah, thank you. Thank you.
