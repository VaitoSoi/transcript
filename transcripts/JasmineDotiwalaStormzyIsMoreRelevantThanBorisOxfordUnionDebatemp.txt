 I now look to Jasmine Dottwala to continue the case for the proposition. Thank you Mr President and good evening Oxford Union. First of all, thank you so much for the invitation to speak here today at this historic venue. historic venue, it's a great honour. I'm wearing a long frock in case my legs and crossing them distracts any future MPs. I find it fascinating that this debate is analysing these two men, one who was shaped by the Oxford Union and the other who was respected enough here to be invited in 2016, but not enough to let him set up a scholarship here in 2018. Something for us all to consider before getting into the detail of this debate is fundamentally conversations like this are fun, thoughtful and passionate, but ultimately they mean nothing because people in this country who do in fact believe that Stormsie is more relevant than Johnson aren't likely to be represented proportionally here in this room tonight. The framing and the curation of this debate is also questionable. Firstly, I abhor the referral to the Prime Minister as Boris in the title of this motion. This man is a politician, holding the highest office in the land, a servant supposedly of the people, He's not Madonna, not Rihanna, calling him Boris automatically ascribes him a man of the people with a culturally relevant moniker, which he most definitely is not. And secondly, just by the line-up of who is on this opposition, the curators of this debate seem to suggest that regardless of what he achieves, criminality and gang culture are significant markers of the Stormsy brand. The implication and the smear are clear. You've shown your hand even before the first speaker spoke. This motion is about relevance, which is measured by marketing and influencer experts. You have here a gang culture expert, an academic who has studied the culture from the outside and whose speciality is linking crime and music, and someone who rejects claims that racism in this country even exists. Just for your information, United Nations human rights experts denounced a British government-backed reporting to racism in the UK this week, saying it's falsified historical facts. So frankly, the framing of tonight's motion drips with content for anyone who hasn't been privately educated or afforded all the connections and privileges that come with it. But what we're debating tonight is crucial, because it's not about pop culture or a rapper versus a politician. This debate brings a question of who has the right to be influential and who decides whose voices are taken seriously. Let's first define relevance and the audience to whom this relevance is targeted. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, relevance is the degree to which something is related and useful to what's happening or being talked about. Everything in this debate hangs on what's relevant and to whom. There's what's personally relevant, what's relevant to the majority of the population, what's relevant on a world versus a local stage, what's relevant to the wealthy and privileged, or those queuing at food banks, and what's relevant to different socio-economic groups. Relevant doesn't hang on spot if, numbers or in the houses of Parliament. It's about the individual capacity to use your voice and power to create deep, effective social change, which Stormsy does with his various initiatives. Relevance is about understanding what your audience want and what they need. For example, Stormsie publicly challenged why black people were not allowed entry into nightclubs. Stormsie saw a lack of opportunities at elite universities for working class-backed students, so he acted by providing, to date, 36 scholarships to Cambridge University. Storms he saw a lack of book deals for working class writers of colour, so he created one with murky books. Can you imagine how far and how high these seeds of opportunity will grow in the future? Like Marcus Rashford and Greta Thunberg, their power to transform and mobilize, to influence the rich and powerful for good, yet operate on a grassroots level to affect change, is truly extraordinary. These are people who use their voice and... You're not Kanye West, babe. You can't interrupt. Sit down. These are people who use their voice and platforms to influence the world around us. And where Stormsies using his voice to take society forward, Johnson drags us down. Rather than be an exemplary role model for the nation, Johnson lies, dissembles, cheats and riches his cronies, his self-serving and disgraces the nation. Sorry. Stormzy has a capacity to speak to the working class in a way that Boris Johnson doesn't. He can speak to white and black, disaffected youth. When Stormsie spoke to me on Channel 4 news about his mental health, he opened up the floodgates for celebrities, young people and even the royal family to disclose and share their own mental health experiences. After this, Channel 4 News commissioned more pieces with black music stars and attracted an audience demographic that hadn't previously been engaged with the show before. That is relevance. After all, whoever controls the minds of the young controls the future. Unlike Stormsy, Johnson's a man born into great wealth and privilege that few of us can enjoy. He sought power for his own personal glory not to create a better world. Stormsy, conversely, uses his power not for personal glory, which is a byproduct of his talent, but to truly level up. Johnson only knows leveling up as buzzwords. On a stage of global influence, Johnson's power resides solely in the fact that he represents a nation. Johnson's personal influence exists because he leads a party that's currently in power, but his fear of influence will go with his office. Johnson has a place in history, of course, because of Brexit and winning an 80-seat majority. That's historical and important, but importance and relevance are not. not the same thing. Johnson's natural relevance is to those who are like him, a tiny minority who happened to run the country, afforded to them purely by an accident at birth. Johnson is the poster boy for nepotism, class and privilege. But the world has come a long way since the Bullington Club, and it will swiftly move on without him. And how trustworthy is he? In a poll of voters last week, the top three words associated with Johnson were incompetent, untrustworthy, and liar. You cannot be relevant if people don't trust you. Who's closer to the communities in this country in terms of real-life, lived experiences? Johnson or Stormsey? Which of these men has manoeuvred their brand higher and higher despite being fired again and again because he has half a Fleet Street on his side writing propaganda and dead cat stories about him, Johnson or Stormsy? The definition of relevant also includes being influential, topical and always timely. And like Ashanti and Jarl, Stormsy is always on time. Calling out Theresa May over Grenfell at the Brits, calling out Johnson and his government at Glastonbury, comparing Johnson and Stormsey is like comparing the past with the future. Johnson represents Old Britain, class, privilege, advancements only by who you know, not what you do, a gentleman's club. Stormsy represents the future, self-made, immigrants, levelling up through his university grants and book publishing deals. Stormsy challenges injustice. Johnson encourages injustice. Being relevant also means living up to expectations and standards. Stormsy far exceeds our expectations of a pop star and that of society of a young black man, whilst Johnson has greatly lowered the standards as an expectations of a man who hasn't even lived up to the expectations of the office he holds. I've no doubt that the opposition tonight may attempt to characterize Stormsey as someone whose words, encourage criminality. Remember when you hear any of Stormsy's lyrics, he's a storyteller reflecting the narratives of society the same way Shakespeare did. When young working class people live in hell, they're not going to rap about flowers and unicorns. I'd ask the question. I'd ask this question, if music is so powerful at impacting young people's behaviour and young people are so easily led, please explain why young people like you all across this union who listen to Grime and Rap aren't violent gangsters. It's not rocket science. It's your environment that shapes you. All of you here are from an environment which affords you opportunity. In fact, the Equality Trust says the link between economic inequality and violent crime is well established. Making a minor sub-genre of music, The Whipping Boy, for serious and deadly crimes, does make, for I agree, controversial headlines on GB News, academic studies at universities or consultancy paychecks from the government. but until you're connected to or a part of the culture from the inside, you're clutching at straws with no facts, and we know that facts matter. Should the opposition point to Stormsie's negative influence on young people, I expect them to cite the evidence of which particular Stormsy track has led to violence, because if there is no evidence, it's conjecture. If you're more outraged by a rapper's words than you are about the environments they're rapping about and Johnson's government policies that create this environment, then as Stormsie would say, shame on you. Blaming music lets off those in power, and it means that they can avoid facing up to the home truths about generations of entrenched and systematic inequality. I mean, honestly, it's just lazy. British politicians have been attempting to link the deaths and teenagers to rap and grime for decades now. Before that, it was scar music and punk, as if gangs didn't exist in Glasgow and Croydon, long before Stormsie picked up a mic to rap. For balance, I'll list the full extent of Boris Johnson's negative lyrics. His narrative on black people, Muslims, the LGBTI community, his sexism, corruption, wasting taxpayers' money on contracts with no due process for his friends and his mistress. Sacked three times for lying, sacked for making up quotes, discussed having a journalist beating up, insulted countries, lied to the Queen, constant broken promises, broken international law. This very week, 56 MPs, a tenth of the Commons, are accused of abusing women. The list of Johnson's lyrics and words have caused problems. That list isn't just as long as my arm, it's as long as all of our arms linked together in this room. Furthermore, violent language are also used by serving politicians. In 2018, the rapper Drill Minister made a rap song called Political Drilling to highlight similarities between the language used by rival gangs on London streets and rival politicians in Parliament. Here are just three examples of those lines. I will not rest until she's chopped up in bags in my freezer. I won't knife you in the back, I'll knife you in the front. The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. So before pointing the finger at Stormsy, look to Johnson's government. Bad behaviour starts at the top and drips through an organisation's DNA. Johnson's toxic behaviour has dripped through Britain like poison and the public see it. Imagine for one moment if both men were the epicenters of their linguistic behaviour. earthquakes. Which man's language do you imagine has had the most damaging impact when those seismic waves of hateful language ripple across the country? Research has shown and proved that Johnson's words have led to increased attacks across Britain. Furthermore, can you imagine the sheer sense of privilege and entitlement that Johnson has had to have to lie repeatedly, yet still be afforded more powerful positions? Consider their track records. For one moment, if Stormsy or other leaders like Barack Obama had Johnson's track record, no way would a black man like Stormsy have any role in public life, let alone ever become a prime minister? So are we saying that we're holding Stormsy to values and higher expectations than the man who sits in the highest office in the country? Many years ago, this would have been a debate about Harold Wilson and the Beatles. Let me ask you then to consider whether the Beatles or Harold Wilson have been more relevant to society nationally. Because eras are defined by great artists. They are the real time stamps. It's why politicians caught the entertainers. It's why Tony Blair courted called Britannia, or why Matt Hancock told me recently on Channel 4 News, well, I say recently a couple of years ago, that he was a huge grime fan. Sorry, I'm already over time. Talk to me in the bar afterwards. Just this week, the boxer Tyson Fury made his ringwalk in his fight to a 20-year-old rat. battle song, Biggie Smalls, juicy, to the largest boxing audience of all time in Europe, 94,000 fans. So when you look at multicultural Britain and what Britain's becoming, Johnson is fighting against it. Stormsy is shaping it. You can criticise Stormsey's lyrics. His excuse could be a lack of father and environment, but how are you going to justify Johnson's hateful rhetoric? Johnson has a very visible father and had the best education that money can buy right here. How do both men make you feel? Johnson has called the people who occupy these halls, nothing but a massage parlour for egos of the assorted twits, twerps, toffs and misfits that inhabit it. Let's look at the numbers and crunch them. A wise man called Jay-Z once said men lie, women lie, but numbers don't. In the 29 election, 2019 election, Johnson won just over 13 million votes, as someone mentioned already. Vossi Bop, just one video from Stormsey, 136 million views. I also had a marketing company crunched the numbers on Boris Johnson's Instagram account. He has 1.7 million followers with just 4% engagement. In contrast, before Stormsie shut down his Instagram, he had more than 3 million followers who were over 75% highly engaged. Remember, whoever controls the youth, controls the future. Stormsie is also building a school in Ghana. His religious faith has seen him win the Sanford St Martin's Trustees Award. So if a religious British establishment say that Stormsie is relevant, who are we to argue with God's messengers? Finally, let's look to their futures. Stormsie will release his third album later this year and is coveted by every media platform. The BBC said Storms is one of the most exciting names who are shaping culture in Britain today and across the world. Johnson is no longer relevant, that's why he'll soon lose his job. Therefore, this House should have all the evidence it needs to believe and agree that Michael Amari, aka Stormsie, is more relevant than Boris Johnson, and therefore I urge you to vote in favour of the motion tonight. Thank you for listening. I'm
