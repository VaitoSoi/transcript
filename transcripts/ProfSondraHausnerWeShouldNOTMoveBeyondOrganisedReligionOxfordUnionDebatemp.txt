 I now look to Professor Sondra Hausner to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you. Does it not sound wonderful? A world where each of us, in our own private moral sphere, can pursue an independent, autonomous vision of the divine, where our individual subjectivities can somehow guide us to a peaceable concatenation of eight billion souls. Our personal spiritual tendencies can somehow sustain us better than our organized religions can, a world far away from the scandals, the power abuses, the moral authority of those institutions that my colleagues hold in such disdain. and disregard organized religion. A utopia, indeed. The premise of this utopian vision is that our organized religions are at fault, that it is organized religions that cause our downfall. And that if only we could somehow move beyond them, we would be free to practice religion in a manner and a mode that would both preserve the human spiritual tendency and avoid the evade the human spiritual tendency and avoid the institutional imperative that appears to be at the root of their inevitable corruption. Alas, it is not so easy. If we wish to preserve the concept, the feeling, the experience of religion and religiosity as a human pursuit, that is if we are committed to working with the concept of religion as a human endeavor in the first place, it is through the vehicle of organized religion that we must do so. The idea of individual religion, although perhaps appealing to those who would embrace our individualistic age, is nonsensical. It is a mere polyanish aspiration set forth by those who do not recall that religion at its essence is a social phenomenon. These are no mere polemics on my part. I refer here to the work of one of the most famous sociologists of the Western world. Emil Durkheim. To use Durkheim's definition, a religion is a shared set of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things in a moral community called a church, all those who adhere to them. It is actually relatively simple. Religion is the very definition of a moral community. If we seek to live within a common ethical framework, we must opt for collect. electivized religion. Individual religion cannot exist if we wish also to live in a shared moral world. In fact, Durkheim himself considered this chamber's very question more than a century ago in his 1912 work, the elementary forms of religious life. He asks, quote, but if one includes the notion of church, by which he means moral community, in the definition of religion, does one not by the same stroke exclude the individual religions that the individual institutes for himself and celebrates for himself alone? Unquote. Presciently, as if looking down on our debate from above, he continues, quote, not only are these individual religious religions very common throughout history, but some people today, he's writing in 1912, pose the question whether such religions are not destined to become the dominant form of religious life, whether a day will not come, perhaps in 2022, we might ask, when the only cult will be the one that each person freely practices in his innermost self, unquote. In short, Durkheim asks our exact question, 100. 10 years in advance of when we do so, wondering alongside us whether the moment is now for individual religions to take the stage. And his answer? Quote, it is obvious that these individual cults are not distinct and autonomous religious systems, but simply aspects of the religion common to the whole church of which the individuals are apart. anyone who thinks this is not Durkheim this is tonight anyone who thinks they are practicing a religion individually is actually practicing an offshoot of a more collectivized version of religion in a personal way we are inescapably members of our own cultures as individually as we may interpret them individual religions are in fact only individual expressions of institutional ones. Let me offer two more technical points on the importance of understanding religion collectively. First, individuals cannot exist on their own. From Durkheim, we know that, quote, man is double, unquote. We are both our individual selves and our collective selves. And when we come together in a festival or a right of any kind, think of your own matriculations here at this esteemed university. We become members of a collective that coheres precisely because of our shared beliefs and practices. Religion, those practices that establish our social codes, our moral values, is the base of our social order. We cannot exist separately, or indeed without the spatial, the temporal, the ethical formats that make up the worlds we live in. Thursday nights are debates at the Union. Trinity term is when we hold exams. Christmas break is a time to gather with family if we can. We do not have to look far to see how organized religion actually organizes our lives, whether or not we are technically believers. We cannot sustain society without it. And second, as an ethnographer of Himalayan religions, I can tell you from empirical research that individuals practicing alone are not as separate as it may at first appear. I found this in my own fieldwork with Hindu ascetics, high in the Himalayas. Imagine me, a Durkheimian scholar, doing fieldwork with individual hermits, each of whom has deliberately traveled to one of the most remote areas of the world across rivers and mountains to get away from places of organized society. Asetics, my colleague said to me, Surely you cannot espouse a theory of collective religion when you work with isolated practitioners in caves, hundreds of miles away from inhabited communities or village religion. Yes, my friends, I precisely did so. For each of these practitioners told me how they felt themselves aligned, inexorably aligned, with cherished lineages of teachers, of fellow brothers in their lines of tuition, all of whom belonged to very organized ascetic Hindu regiments, each of which had its own teachings, its own history, its own initiation rituals. Individual practice was not spontaneously generated nor spontaneously performed. It was drawn from a well-worn, long-recognized set of principles, philosophies, and ritual actions that had been established, tried, and tested. within those institutions to which these individual religious aspirants so proudly belonged. The fact of individual practice, even individual interpretation, in no way undoes the inevitability of organized religion. To return them to my opening gambit and to echo my colleague in opposition quite apart from the question of whether we could do so, and I argue we could not, would we really choose a world where autonomous, isolated, disconnected individuals become the foundation of ethical life? To my ear, that sounds not a productive anarchy that challenges hierarchy, but a dystopia where each person lives for themselves, within a world whose ethics they personally generate. But an individual ethic not shared with others is no society at all. As the American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz wrote in 1966, quote, Undirected by organized systems of significant symbols, which is not a bad definition of religion. Continue the quote, man's behavior would be virtually ungovernable, a mere chaos of pointless acts and exploding emotions, his experience virtually shapeless, unquote. If we seek, by contrast, a collective ethic, the possibility of a shared moral discourse, We are back in the realm of social, organized religion. In conclusion, friends, colleagues, Madam President, students present, I speak in opposition to the motion, even as I support the articulation of individual expressions of religious thought and practice. But to suggest that it is possible to move beyond organized religion is a naive position, one that does not understand the provenance or the genealogy, or the genealogy of individual religious life. Organized religion is at its base the way humans organize our most basic social impulses. We come together to worship our identities, the spaces of our world, the times of our calendar, all emerge from organized religion. A world without it would simply stop making sense. When we understand that religion is an inherent aspect of human life and that organizing ourselves is the way we make sense to each other, we realize that we act in the context of a powerful set of social imperatives that can be harnessed to the good and within which our individual spiritual lives can still flourish. Thank you. The
