 The motion before the House tonight is this house believes there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. I'm sure you're as excited to get to it as I am. So I call on Alex Fish, elected member of Standing Committee, to open the case for the proposition. Thank you, Madam President, for affording me the honour to once again speak in this historic chamber. May I also thank you for all the work you have done in your many terms of the society to make it a better place. I'm so glad that you've finally given me permission to do what I always wanted to do in this chamber, which has bashed the horrific system of neoliberal capitalism whilst wearing black tie. Proposition tonight have to persuade you that the system that we all participate in is fundamentally unethical. That is obviously not a nice thing for anyone to admit to themselves, but it's something that we have to face up to. Now, capitalism is a highly complex topic. Many a tome has been written about how to define it. So I decided to go to the esteemed president herself, Molly, and ask a PPEist how to define capitalism. The response I got was, oh no, and I decided to go to the esteem president. was, oh no, and then she ran away. Nonetheless, capitalism is an economic system in which we all reside and participate in. The market has sovereignty over the means of production. Many have tried to reform and defang capitalism. But it is a system that rests on injustice. It is a system that rests on exploitation. And by participating in this system, willingly or unwillingly, we are engaging in an unethical practice. Three main points in my speech today. Firstly, why the processes of production under capitalism make it unethical. Secondly, why consumer attempts to make capitalism ethical still fail. And thirdly, the solutions is issue. But before I go into my main points, I have the immense honour of introducing the opposition speakers tonight. First up, we have the graduate officer, Isra Khan. Well, I've never quite heard a speaker hear-here-here themselves, but this is the first time. Now, many have compared Israel and myself. We both attend every event we can at the Union. We both have organized very fun socials. I want to give a huge shout out to Israel for the graduate social that will be happening this Saturday. It's going to be a lot of fun. If you can attend, please do. However, unlike me, Israel didn't quite get elected to Secretary's Committee. Secretary's Committee. Oh. But I'm glad to see he's bouncing back now and he'll make a great speech this evening. Next up is Sam Hall, who has done amazing work as the Director of the Conservative Environment Network. When I heard that Sam was coming to speak in tonight's debate, I think I had a very similar reaction to everybody in this room. Who is that? You know, I began to worry that Sam would be far too boring to roast, but then I was a very much to roast. But then, I struck Gold. It turns out that Mr. Hall was formerly the employee of one of our former presidents here at the Oxford Union, Michael Gove. Truly, if anybody is able to talk strenuously about working under its unexploited boss, it will be Mr. Hall. The third speaker tonight is Simon Mundy, a writer and journalist who has published a lot of work talking about how to deal with the climate crisis. Now, famously, union debates can become quite awkward when members of committee have to roast each other and then we have to face each other the next day. Now, tonight, I have no doubt that Simon will have a very similar issue because on my side, we've got Tom Burgess, a fellow Financial Times reporter. Now, inevitably, when Tom makes a much more nuanced and better analysis and a wittier speech, I hope that things don't get too awkward in the FTE office tomorrow. Finally, we have the extremely talented Larissa Cobour, who serves alongside me on standing committee this term. Now, I'm unsurprised to see Larissa on that bench, considering earlier today she confessed to me that the dress she is currently wearing was ordered from the fast-fashioned giant ASOS. At least we can say that Larissa firmly practices what she is preaching tonight. Madam President, these are your guests and they are most welcome. Now, I'm moving on to my first point about the exploitative and unethical nature of production under capitalism. The inherent drive of capitalism is to make the most amount of money from your workers, paying them as little as possible, but getting them to do the most amount of work as possible. Now, in a world, in which money is needed to survive, employers have a hell of a lot of power in the wage market. In developing countries around the world, workers are exploited on wages that. that are nearly enough to survive day by day. In Bangladesh, FEMA workers are paid 10 cents an hour to produce Spice Girl T-shirts that cost 60 pounds to buy here in the UK. But it's not just in developing countries that workers are exploited for profit. It happens right here on our doorstep as well. Almost one-tenth of the UK workforce is not currently being paid the national living wage. And for many people, the national living wage isn't enough to live off anyway. Sports Direct workers and Amazon warehouse workers are being forced to camp outside their places of work in case they lose their jobs the next day. Now, the other side will try to tell you tonight that this is not a problem of capitalism, but fundamentally a problem with people who are making bad decisions. I'm afraid this just isn't the case. This is too widespread to simply be an anomaly of the system because it is the system. To add to this, businesses are at the forefront of perpetuating the climate crisis. Now, I could rattle off statistics about the huge impact corporations have had on climate, on climate change. But I want you to think about this on a much more individual level. Christmas has just happened, we can talk about toys. Take a Barbie doll. Over three cups of oil go into every single Barbie doll that is produced. There is so much toxicity in the plastic products that we are producing right now that it almost rivals the Oxford Union politics in the toxicity that is being produced. In short, the products we buy every day are tainted by unethical practices of exploiting labor. They perpetuate inequality, and they catalyze the most pressing issue facing humanity at the moment. So, moving on, having painted a picture of a world ravaged by the woes of capitalism, I want to turn to what alternatives consumers go to. Now, although I would argue, as you'll see in a moment, that it's very hard to find completely ethical production of most products, we can definitely still try. And indeed, as an example, I want to use my famous tartan trues that many people know me for wearing. These bad boys are a hunting McLean tartan, and they come from the McCalls of Brotty Ferry, which is a local family tartan shop. And indeed, the Bonnie Prince Charlie jacket that I'm wearing this evening comes from the charity shop just down the road from my house in Dundee. So clearly, there are choices to be made of finding something much more ethically produced than we currently do have. However, despite having options there, most people do not make these choices. But we can all agree that most people believe in climate change, they don't like the exploitation of labour, but why don't they still make these choices? It's because they're tired. It's because they feel they're powerless in the fight. After all, we cannot run away from the same tired-old facts, that brought this debate into existence. The huge amount of control exerted by big business in our society. 70% of global emissions are produced by just 100 companies. More lobbying dollars are spent every year in Britain and America trying to break up trade union movements than are spent on the climate change issue. But despite the captains of capitalism who are crushing the methods that would offer us on alternative ethical system, as despite the, instead of getting rid of them, we are in fact entrusting them with the future of our society. Does anybody know? No, thank you. Does anybody know which group had the largest number of delegates at COP26? Simon Mundy knows he reported on it. It was the fossil fuel industry, which had more than double of the UK delegation. Now, who was invited to all these climate change conferences? Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio. One of them has spent his whole life exploiting cheap labor for mining materials that goes into his technology, and the other flies around the world in his private jet. We've handed the keys of our future to the very people that put us here in the first place. They have no desire to change, otherwise they already would have. Members, we are all participants in this system. We have all bought products that we know have been made in fundamentally unethical ways. And I know I have painted a very bleak and at times scary picture of the world. But we don't need to keep living like this. We can start setting up cooperative and worker-owned businesses that give people a fair wage. We can start putting in policies, taxing corporations who are the worst offenders of the climate crisis. I worry, however, members, that we leave the chamber tonight. People feel well, the world's in a bad space, but it will just get better on its own. And it's such a shame that it's in that way. Members, we can't stand for this. It's time to organise. It's time to not just ask for a better world, but start demanding a better world. Vote like your life depends on it. Take to the streets protesting for change and start supporting sustainable, and non-exploitative production methods. The climate crisis is not inevitable. The exploitation of workers is not inevitable. But the change we want to see is not inevitable either, unless we seize it now. For the sake of our society and for the sake of yourselves, you must vote side proposition tonight. Thank you. I'm
