 Good evening, Honourable Members and thank you very much for joining us. Before we proceed with tonight's event, members are reminded to abide by the society's rules and forms of the House, including ensuring our guests receive a courteous and respectful hearing. Members are also reminded that no filming, photography or recording is permitted. Today we are joined by diplomatic representatives of the United Arab Emirates, the State of Israel, and the Kingdom of Bahrain for a panel discussion on the Abraham Accords. The Abraham Accords are a series of joint normalization agreements, signed between Israel and several Arab states, first signed by Bahrain and the UAE in 2020. Since then, Morocco and Sudan have also normalized relations with Israel. Until 2020, no Arab state had normalized relations with Israel since Jordan in 1996, a fact that demonstrates the significance of the Accords. They have not, however, been free from controversy. The Arab states involved have been accused of abandoning the people of Palestine, whilst the Trump's administration's grand promises for the expansion of the accords have not materialized. In the first event of its kind across the world, we are joined by his Excellency, Manso Abululul, emirati ambassador to the United Kingdom, her Excellency Tippi Hotevelli, Israeli ambassadors to the UK, and Mr. Hussein Mohammed Alam, deputy head of the Bahraini mission to the United Kingdom to discuss the past, present, and future of the Abraham Accords and what they mean for the Middle East. each of the ambassadors will give brief opening remarks on the Accords for taking questions from me and then from the audience. Please join me in welcoming the Residencies. Thank you very much. His Excellency, Mansour Abouloul, will give opening remarks first. Thank you very much, Charlie. Am I switched on? I think so? Yeah. Great privilege really to be addressing such a distinguished audience and I do hope we have a meaningful discussion for you today that with something you can take away with. I was thinking a lot before this event in terms of what I would say, what I would speak about, and a phrase came to mind, in fact, and to those learned linguists within the audience, they would understand what it means, but it's Ehlqqqatab, which means the people of the book, and draws importance on the historical connections between Muslims, Jews and Christians, And too sadly, when we look at the region today, over the last decades, it's been sort of mired by a lot of trouble and conflict. And I think with the Accords two years ago, that certainly provided, from the Emirates perspective, a new profound meaning to how we establish, how the Arab world can establish relations with Israel. So from that perspective, the fundamental premise the Accords for me really stands upon is about building dialogue and cooperation and communication. So that's something that I think from our perspective has really transformed things. But it's also been based upon a lot of understanding and acceptance. And if I may say so, I'm sort of the living proof of that. it might not be to do with the Abram Accords. But my mother originally from Cambridge, and I'll be careful not to mention that too many times, but she married an Emirati man. They met in the 60s in Cambridge. That's the last time I mentioned that. But that cultural sort of bridge was huge at its time. My mother went and traveled. She's now Emirati. But in 1968, she arrived in the Emirates. And so, you know, for me, that's kind of, I've always seen those two, with the role that I do, it's brought sort of two, and I promise I won't go on for too long, but it's brought two halves of my life together. But I think that that sort of acceptance and dialogue is exceptionally important in the world that we live in. And having spent most of my sort of upbringing in the Emirates, I then went on and studied in boarding school in Scotland, of all places. And I went to a school that was. founded by a distinguished German Jewish educationalist, Kurt Hahn, you may know. And he certainly instilled in the school and in me a sense of acceptance and understanding. But he also instilled this character, the education side. And I think we need to view the accords in that regard. We need to be determined to overcome the challenges and stay the course. So that's really my opening remarks, Charlie, you know, and it's a great privilege. I feel so humbled, actually, someone of my standing to be addressing such a distinguished audience. So thank you very much indeed. Your Excellency. Thank you for Havinas. I'm really, really excited from sharing the state with my friends with Mansour and Hussain. here in Oxford Union that celebrates 200 years anniversary. So it's really wonderful. Thank you so much for having us celebrating two years of the Abraham Accords and 200 years for the Oxford Union. 15th of December, 15th of September 2020 was a very important date in the Middle East history. This was the date where the Abraham Accords was signed in Washington in the White House. And I remember myself as a child dreaming about the option of peace with our world. But for many years, people doubted that as an option. They said it's impossible. You need to solve the Palestinian issue first. And you cannot move forward without solving your closest neighbor's problem. And Israel's approach was always to sign peace with all our neighbors. So this is Rai Menachem Begin signed a peace agreement with Egypt, our biggest neighbor. And then Itchak Rabin was signing an agreement with Jordan in the 90s. And then Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to change the paradigm. He said if it's possible to have peace with Jordan and Egypt, then it's possible to have peace with the whole our world. And he moved forward after many years of building a very delicate and gentle, infrastructure and this piece became a reality. And this reality for me is the fact that it's not just a political agreement, it's not just agreement between leaders, but it became people-to-people agreement. And I always like to say that my first meetings when I came to the UK was not with the Queen, we're not with other ambassadors than those colleagues here, with Shaq Fouaz, and my colleagues and I felt the warmth that the Abraham Accords brought to the Middle East. And we will speak a lot about the great collaboration we have, but for me the fact it's a people-to-people piece is the most wonderful thing that could happen in my lifetime and in my children's lifetime. Mr. Allen? I'll be... If you may, I'll be reading out my remarks, Excellencies, President McIntosh, Union members. On behalf of his excellency, Ambassador Sheikh Fawazal Khalifa, I am delighted to be in such a distinguished company here in this historic setting of the Oxford Union. As we discuss the Abraham Accords and the prospects for peace, prosperity, and cooperation across the Middle East and North Africa. I want to start by thanking the Union President Charlie McIntosh, Development Chair Michael Lee, and all those who have helped arrange tonight's event, and by warmly congratulating the Oxford Union and all its members in this 200th anniversary year. Tonight we are considering both the background to the Abraham Accords and what they might mean for the future of our region and its peoples. By way of brief introduction, I want to outline the history and values which informed Kingdom of Bahrain's decision to sign the accords and which underpin our national, regional and international policies more generally. For centuries and more, Bahrain has held a unique position as a regional trading hub and a meeting point between nationalities, faiths, and cultures. Today we have one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse societies in the region, with Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus and others living, working and worshiping freely alongside their fellow citizens and residents. And in recent years, His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa al-Qhalifa has further built on this heritage through initiatives such as the King Hamid Center for peaceful coexistence and the Kingdom of Bahrain Declaration, reaffirming our deep-rooted Bahraini values of coexistence, dialogue, and mutual respect. Because there can be no doubt that the Middle East has failed to approach its potential or that of its peoples. Through decades of hostility and confrontation, it has failed to grow those networks. of trade, cooperation, interaction, and interdependence, which underpin not just prosperity, but also lasting security and stability. Without wanting to sound utopian, our hope is that the Abraham Accourse can change this dynamics across the Middle East and provide new perspectives and avenues towards resolving the challenges facing the region and its people. region and its people. So looking to the future, our hope is the Abraham Accords can be the first step in achieving the region's potential by building economic and trade ties, by developing networks of cooperation and trust by bringing people together across our societies and by enabling individuals and communities to fulfill their aspirations in an atmosphere. of coexistence, respect and trust. This is our optimistic take on the Accords and their future, and one which we genuinely hope we can come close to achieving. I therefore look forward to an interesting and informative discussion with the distinguished ambassadors and the members of the unions which I hope will deepen our understanding of the Abraham Accords and the future potential for the Middle East. Thank you so much. So prior to the signing of the Abraham Accords, the existence of diplomatic relations between Israel and the UAE, and to a lesser extent Bahrain, had been an open secret for years, if not decades. So if diplomatic channels were already established between the states, what change to the Abraham Accords actually offer? We'll go to your Excellency first. So do you mean for the region or do you mean along a bilateral level? Both. Both. So on a bilateral level, I mean, the benefits have been huge. I mean, just when you dial in these two very dynamic countries, very dynamic economies, you've seen immediate benefits when it's come to trade, investment, cooperation around climate, the people connectivity, as Zippy said, is huge. we have over 500,000 Israelis that visit us. You know, when you talk people in culture, we just inaugurated the Abrahamic family house. So there have been big benefits from that side. And when you're establishing a bilateral relationship from the ground up, it requires a lot of work. Where we've seen sort of immediate benefits on sort of a more broader regional basis is we feel we can actually serve the Palestinian cause better, by having direct relations with Israel. And if you look back in history, the countries that have sort of been most influential in terms of peace talks are those that have had those direct links with Israel. So from that perspective, we've seen, I mean, a very live example was the presidential statement that was issued by the UN Security Council that was led by the UAE in many ways, having links with the Palestinians there, but also having discussions with the Israelis and the Americans, you know, and that's, you know, prior to the Accords, that wouldn't have been possible. So, I mean, from that perspective, those are the type of examples. But, you know, I think the Accords provides a communication framework that's vital, that's so important. And that's really, you know, it's along those lines. But as I say, you've got to build dialogue, you've got to build that trust and confidence for things to work. and we're just starting with the accords. You know, I think it's, you can't see the Abram Accords in isolation. You've got to see it in the many steps that have been taken. And, you know, we have, things are tense at the moment, but we potentially averted a crisis, but things are still simmering, you know, and it will require further efforts by the international communities, but you've seen clear evidence of UA demonstrating, UA diplomacy demonstrating that we can arrive at a solution to dial things down. So from that perspective, yeah. We'll talk further about the consequences of Palestine in a second. But do you deny that there were diplomatic links between the UN and Israel prior to the signing of the Abraham Accords, even if they weren't formalized or in embassies? I'm really here to talk about the current and the future. I think countries will have the current and future. But countries will have channels of communication for intelligence purposes. I can't really comment on those. It's slightly outside of my lane, but I'm here to talk about the current in the future. Do you care to comment on that, Your Excellency, on perhaps there being prior channels of communication between these two states and Israel before the Abraham Accords? Well, I think I said that in my remarks, that it was built step by step for many years, but I think there is nothing to compare formal diplomatic relations than the things we had before. no doubt that this is a game changer in the region. And speaking about that, I will really follow up on what my dear friend Mansour said. So he was speaking about building frameworks. So I think one of the most successful frameworks that was built was the Negev Summit that I think this year will be in Morocco. And Morocco is part of the Abraham Accords. And the fact that it gave inspiration to more countries to join. to share with us the challenges in the region and to address it with solutions being discussed together. This is incredible. The fact we have working teams on all the challenges in the region and I'm talking before security, security is definitely one of them, but daily life things like health, like climate, things in regards to our future, as we all want to have renewable energy, We all would like to see water solutions in the future. All countries suffer from desert areas. So all together, food security, all those issues that are top priority for each of our countries. We share technological knowledge. We share our abilities with the know-how. I think it's incredible. And this is why I think nothing to compare before and after. This is really a moment that changed our lives. And just to give you a small example from our lives as Israelis, just today, the foreign minister was announcing about flights flying over the space area of Oman. And that's going to make flights to the Far East shorter in few hours. Think about the time being saved and also about the accessibility for half of the world for us. After for many years it's been, you know, going through bypasses. not direct. This is incredible. The same with Saudi, so we had the ability to fly to India through Saudi Air Pass. This is things that are changing the daily life of everyone. So it's incredible. Mr. Alan, when the accords were first signed, it was remarked by some commentators that Bahrain very much seemed the third of three parties within the Abraham Accords. Do you think this is a fair representation? Well, not truly. This is some of the, let's say, tabloid, what or the news was some of the journalists were using. The Abraham Accords was a decision by all four countries hand in hand, United States, Bahrain, UAE, Israel, all together. They had this idea of paving the way and forming a right path in order to have security, stability, and prosperity in the region. And this is what they did. We can see the outcome of that on a daily basis. We see, as His Excellency mentioned, the exchanges, the cooperation, the trade indicators, the visits. In the past two years and a half, they have gone from none to, I don't know, countess. Countless. So in true meaning, the Abraham Accords have been a genuine path towards development, towards peace, security, and looking much further in a better future for all countries and all people of the region. Moving on then to the consequences for Palestine. In almost all of the people, peace talk for the last seven decades. The Arab world has held diplomatic relations with Arab states as being a bargaining tool used to get concessions for the Palestinian people. Do the Abraham Accords represent the abandonment of the Palestinian people and the cause of Palestine by the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan? Go to your Exence first. Most definitely not. We stand with the Palestinian people and as I said very central to the Accords was how we could serve the Palestinian people by having direct relations with Israel. So certainly not and we continue to provide aid. As I said, the presidential statement was a guarantee of providing financial aid. So we stand with them. I mean our ultimate aim is to deliver a just cause for this people. people and end any conflict and violence. So we stand with all parties in finding a solution, but in the end, this has to come from direct negotiations, direct dialogue between those two parties. And we certainly see the accords in our role as an influencer, as a potential safety valve, you know, for when things simmer and when tensions rise, but also moving it to creating the space where they can come in and dialogue. In 2020, when the Accords was signed, the UAE stated that they were in fact doing so to help the cause of the Palestinian people, because in agreement of the UAE signing the Accords, Israel had agreed to suspend their illegal annexation of the West Bank. Would the UAE pull out of the Abraham Accords if this process were to be resumed? No, the accords, I mean, the whole region has been rewired. There's no going back, you know, but I think, again, I reference the live example that we had earlier in the week, where we worked with the Americans, we worked with the council members, the Security Council, to issue a presidential statement, and our Israeli friends have frozen, you know, any activity. So there is, you know, things are not easy. I'm not sort of suggesting that we can solve this overnight, but at least there's attempts by the UAE and many other countries to actually move this in the right. right direction. Even if they have frozen this settlement building annexation, it is not unforeseeable that the process would resume. With diplomatic relations normalised now, would the UAE respond by going back on the Abraham Accords and stopping, ceasing diplomatic relations again? I think that would be hugely counterproductive, you know, a step to do, and no, the UAE wouldn't do that. You know, we're committed to these accords. These are accords, as my colleague had said, and Zipi said, these are accords for building peace and prosperity, ultimately, you know, and we see them as a framework of communication, so certainly not. Mr. Alam, what's Bahrain's view on this? The accords were much less popular in Bahrain than they were in the UAE amongst the people. I totally agree with His Excellency's remarks on that the Arab countries have, always stood beside Palestine, their position is clear, and it will be as it is, nothing will change. What our intake is on that is that with the Abraham Accords, we found it more suitable and more achieving to have other doors of negotiation, other doors of discussion, opening other pathways of sitting between two sides and understanding where the issues are and trying to resolve them altogether. So at the end of the day, it's becoming a good tool in order to get two sides together that are, and two sides that haven't been kind of able to reach to a certain solution while the Abraham Accords countries could help in that process. You said that Bahrain will always stand with the Palestinian people, But if the Palestinian people and the Palestinian government and the foreign secretary of the Arab League have all claimed this is not in the interest of the Palestinian people, how can you reconcile those two courses of action? At the end of the day, this is, to be honest, this is politics. Everybody is going to be saying whatever he deems necessary for his own cause. We stand on our position, again, and I reiterate, this is the position of all Arab countries. and we are an Arab country and we will stand as it is on our position. So nothing would change that. Your Excellency, you said in your opening remarks, you quoted President Netanyahu saying that peace has to start at home and with Israel's neighbors. Is Israel's neighbor not first and foremost Palestine? And where does Palestine fit into President Netanyahu's plan vision for the Abraham Accords? So just to be accurate about what Netanyahu's vision was, Netanyahu said that everyone is trapped in a paradigm where they're investing just in the Palestinian question, and they don't see the big regional issues. And he said, if we'll do it the other way around, we'll do from the outside, we'll go and start with the Arab countries that we have so much to share and so many challenges we have in common, then the Palestinians will follow. So I think in Netanyahu's vision, he always wanted to reach peace, but he knew that the way to peace might be in a creative way. So his creative way to say, look how much the region is earning from this amazing cooperation between our Arab friends and all the Arab countries in the region. I know he keeps on saying that he wants to extend the Abraham Accords, he wants to deepen in all levels, both trade. There is a wonderful trade agreement being, with the UAE, one of the fastest, I'm quite jealous with my colleague sitting in Abu Dhabi, and here with Bahrain, I know we're working on a new trade deal, so trade and all the working plans we have moving forward. So I think it's an inspiration, and this is something that we're calling all our neighbors to come and join the prosperity that peace brings. You nodded along when Mr. Alam said that all of these things are political, the statements made up political. Is there not also some truth in the facts that points out by many pundits that the reason that Israel and particularly Messon Netanyahu in his party are so keen to extend and deepen the Abraham Accords is to further isolate Palestine and make full occupation of the West Bank easier? Yeah. So the truth is it's the other way around because actually I think Netanyahu was brave to say we are not going to stop seeking for peace agreements while the Palestinians at the moment are divided in their leadership. You know, half of the Palestinians are led by Hamas, terror organization, denies the right of Israel to exist. So he said, let's move forward. How are we going to move forward? So let's try to achieve more in the region. Now, speaking about the Palestinians' refusal, I just want to remind you a few months ago, there was one of the most progressive liberal governments we ever had in Israel, including members from the Arab parties and, Netanyahu was in the opposition. So the refusal of the Palestinians had nothing to do to Netanyahu as a person. It was their approach towards Israel. So even when the country was led by Yair Lepid, who's a left-wing leader, they refused to come and sit and negotiate. And just like my friend here, His Excellency said, obviously you cannot solve problems with your neighbors without having direct negotiation. You cannot go to the UN to solve your problems. You cannot just ignore the problems. You need to sit and talk and you need to come for direct talks like we always used to have and this is the only thing can achieve peace. And mentioning another thing, many people mention different barriers for peace. And I'm afraid we need to mention the fact that Israel is under terrorism many times from Palestinian terrorism and just in the last month we lost children, we lost innocent people being attacked directly by Palestinians, Syrian terrorists, one of the most horrific attacks I remember as a young person. Free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free, free. This is freedom of speech. This is freedom of speech. We're for that. And Oxford Union is a good model for freedom of speech. But I think the people are saying from the river to the sea, Palestine is free. Basically are saying Israel shouldn't exist. And my colleagues and I, not just we want it, Not just we want Israel to exist, we want all our countries to prosper together by cooperating. And people that are against that idea are against peace. So I think we should remember terrorism is against peace and innocent people being killed is against peace. And as a mother for three young daughters, I want to see a future where a Palestinian child wants, and he's dreaming about a peace with Israel and not a peace without Israel. returning to the devises this cause within the Arab world, states like Kuwait and Lebanon who have sort of expressly ruled out, well, the Abraham Accords and expressed criticism of them. Does this mark the end of pan-Arab unity and pan-Abb cooperation? I think we're looking at the dawn of a new region, you know, and the Arab world will still play very, very strong within that, but we're looking at New Dawn and, you know, I think it's one that has, if we look decades back, the UK and US have kind of led those relations to Israel, you know, and you're seeing organically from the region itself those players now normalizing with Israel, and that's surely a good thing, you know, if it's surely stronger for the region. So I think on your question about other countries and, you know, that aspect, I think we have to work really hard to honour the commitments of the Accords and see them through and deliver on the achievements. There's an awful lot of work to do there, so we're very laser-focused on that. And I think that will inspire, that should inspire other countries at the right time. It's their own sovereign decision when they do that. at the right time, but we're busy working hard on delivering the commitments of the Accords, and there's a lot of work to do that. I'm conscious that I want to allow as much time as possible for audience questions, so I'll ask one more question each to Mr. Alam and Her Excellency. Mr. Alam, Morocco and Israel have since their normalization of diplomatic relations, have since signed a defense and security agreement, which many have claimed, makes Morocco complicit in some of the actions of the Israeli defense force, for example, the attack in the West Bank yesterday, which killed both terrorist fighters and innocent civilians. Would Bahrain consider a security agreement with Israel, particularly given that it's often speculated that Bahrain's primary motivation for joining the Abraham Accords was fear of Iran's influence in the Persian Gulf? To be honest, I wouldn't take it from that perspective, and I wouldn't only focus on the defense side of it or the security side of it. If I want to mention what the Abraham Accords have achieved so far for Bahrain, I'd say we've already signed 45 MOUs and agreements, 13 which are ongoing or in process. Seven of those or eight are purely dealing with trade and investment. So looking at the bright side of it, whether it's investment, whether it's health, whether it's food security, water security, climate. We have to look into it from a very general perspective and see the outcome and the goals we want to achieve in that regard. But it's not purely defense, not purely security, as I mentioned. It's a comprehensive package that we are trying to achieve between ourselves and our friends in Israel and our friends in the UAE and the Abraham Accords signatories. So the, so Bahrain does acknowledge that it has security collaborations with Israel that give it connections with the IDF and their actions. Again, sorry? So Bahrain does acknowledge that it has security agreements with Israel that make it engaged with the IDF and their actions. I did not mention that. I said it's a general perspective of all MOU's agreements, covering different aspects. Now, I'm not sure, to be honest, with the point you raised, but in general, it's various fields of cooperation, and we're working towards achieving much more for the security and stability of the whole region, not only Bahrain. But you did say to look at the brighter side of the agreements that have been reached between Bahrain and Israel, which implies perhaps a less bright or darker side to them. I'm always optimistic. look into the brighter side of it. So everybody and anywhere at any time would always look forward for a better future, not looking to anything in the past. You excellency then, before we open up to audience questions. When the accords were announced, President Trump said that five more Arab states in negotiations signed the accords, and since then Morocco and Sudan have. Who were the other three? conversations about the Accords gone much more quieter under the Biden administration, with the administration refusing to even call it the Abraham Accords. Is it just an American political football? You should ask this question, Trump and Biden. If they'll come, I'll happily ask them the question. Well, the Union definitely hosted very important American politicians and others. I think from our point of view, and I'm sure my colleagues, will agree we want to extend the accords. We would like as many countries to join and we really want to work hard in order to make it happen. Obviously the world has changed. Russia, Ukraine is a serious thing. We are very much concerned about Iran and the Russian-Uranian cooperation on Ukraine. So definitely different times bring different agendas. But our agenda in the region is to extend the peace circle. And when I'm saying, I mean, of course, the Israeli government lead, by Netanyahu, so I know that we are keen to move forward. And who were the other three states that Trump were going to? I really don't know who Trump had in mind. I know that Netanyahu mentioned many times you want Saudi to join. Now we had this agreement with Oman, that is a good sign about, you know, warming up with Oman. We just had Sudan a few weeks ago. You know, so we keep on working on extending the peace circle. With that, we'll open up to questions in the audience. If you'd like to ask a question, please raise your hand or membership card and you'll be called upon. Or first go to the member over there in the corner. Yeah, with the blue shirt on and the... Yeah. Thanks a lot. Thanks so much for joining this event and for agreeing to take questions. I just have a quick question, but it applies to all. three of you distinguished guests. Oh yes, sorry, I should have caveat to this. All questions must be addressed to all three panelists. Thank you. So don't you think it's a shame that this event couldn't have taken place without all of the security that we're seeing around this room? And do you all see a possibility for a possible future where this level of security isn't necessary for an event such as this to take place between distinguished guests from your respective countries? Thank you. The question was, do you all think it's regrettable that this event has to take place to so much security, and do you think there is a possibility of a world in which event like this can happen without such security? Is that a fair paraphrasing? Do you want to go first? Yeah. Do you want to go first, Mr. Alam? Well, I think when people do understand what we are trying to achieve here, then it would be possible. Any comments from your Excellcies? Not really, I mean, I think these are detail. Forgive me, not really, I think these are detail, and we all wish that we can live in a sort of safer world, but, you know, there's, the precautions are there for a reason, so, but I agree with you. It would be great if we could do this in years to come with no security. Yes. I love my team that is watching me, but I definitely would love to have my life without security, so all I want to join to the prayers that we're not going to need that. Next question please. We'll go to the member here in the blue and white jumper. Thank you so much. Thank you for being here. I think I've been following all of your work, Madam Motovli, especially yours. So I just wanted to ask you, like, in terms of like mental health as a student, there's so much happening in the world. It's hard to, you know, it's just becomes hard and it wears you down. But especially following your work, you killed 10 people in Nablus yesterday. You killed 10 in Janine last month. You bombed Syria when I was going through an earthquake. So how do you sleep with yourself at night just in terms of like students, mental health? Because we're unable to do that. So I just want to ask like, how do you do it? Like, is it supposed to you have a stone heart or what? Like if you could just guide us through it, I would absolutely love it. Been following your work. I'm such a fan. I wish I had a nervous system like you, but I don't. Thank you so much. Thank you. So the question is about the last operation in Nablus and the former one in Janine. Unfortunately, Israel suffered for many terror attacks. Most of them you heard of. There was a Friday night synagogue service on the International Memorial Day of the Holocaust. And a Palestinian terrorist walked with a gun and was firing and shooting innocent people. 11 people got killed from those Palestinian attacks just in the last few weeks. And whenever our intelligence is getting a very specific alert, this is exact, it's a shame you don't want to listen because I'm actually answering. But we would like to answer. This is a dialogue. I think if you really want to listen, this is where we're coming here to the university to have an engagement. and the reason we're using our defense forces is to defend our people. The UK would have done the same. The UK would have done the same and any other country in the world, including all our friends in the world, the Western countries, want to defend their people. We don't want kids to be killed in the streets of Jerusalem, just like we had those innocent faces of Yaakov and Ashel Peli, beautiful young kids that were brutally murdered, I cannot forget the image of their faces. So I don't want any child to be killed, not a Palestinian child, not a Jewish child. But the truth is we never target civilians. And unfortunately, those terrorists were targeting those young Israeli kids. Given that question should be addressed to all panelists. Do our other two panelists agree with the member that the attack on the... the West Bank constitutes a terrorist attack. I think we're very clear with our statement the UA made and we called for, we condemned the attack on Nablus, but we are calling for restraint. And I go back to the presidential statement, we need to find solutions to this. We need to find safety valves to release the pressure. And we are very concerned when these things happen. and violence is not a solution to anything. To be honest, I can't add on his excellency, Bahrain's position was the same position, so I can't add anything more. So regrettable and condemned, but you wouldn't go as far to say their terrorist attacks? That variation? We have an official statement. Okay, okay. And I look for another question from the audience, look to the member here, coach second row at the front. Yeah, you. Thank you. I just wanted to ask to all three panelists, of course, is the Arab Peace Initiative now abandoned since a shortcut like the Abraham Accords provided the possibility of a shortcut to diplomatic relations with Israel without first solving the Palestine issue? And do you think the Abraham Accords is a good enough argument or selling point to non-Arab Muslim countries such as Indonesia to normalize? relations with Israel so those outside the region specifically thank you could you you repeat the question sorry I said is the Arab Peace Initiative now abandoned since a shortcut like the Abraham Accords provided the possibility of a shortcut to diplomatic relations with Israel without first solving the Palestine issue and do you think the Abraham Accords is a good enough argument or selling to non-Arab Muslim countries in the region, so outside the region, to normalize relations with Israel, because most non-Arab Muslim countries would insist we solve the Palestine issue first before we move on to diplomatic relations. So let's tackle both those questions, one than the other. So you're excellent, you want to tackle the question about the Arab Peace Initiative? Certainly. I mean, we support the Arab Peace Initiative, and what I'd remind you really is that, please don't look at these things in isolation. You've got to see them as steps, important steps, and the Arab Peace Initiative is an important one, one, as is the Abraham Accords. They're all seeking to deliver that solution and just solution for the Palestinian cause. Mr. Alam, obviously, you cannot speak for the governments of other nations, but do you think that the Abraham Accords opens the way for non-Arab Muslim states, such as Indonesia or sub-Saharan African countries, to normalize relations with Israel? Definitely. This is what we have been saying from the beginning, that having a successful Abraham, of course, having the signatories over there, shows other countries that there is a way, there is a path, and it can be done. So definitely, hopefully we will be seeing more countries to join. As Her Excellency mentioned, Sudan just joined like two weeks ago, and hopefully some others are on the way. 100% agree with my colleagues. I suppose that a general question from me to Mr. Lammon and your excellence. is, you know, if the aim of this is for all Arab states across the world to normalize relations with Israel, all Muslim states across the world to normalize relations of Israel, do you see why the people of Palestine feel let down and abandoned by it? I was reticent to use this phrase, but sometimes you fear what you don't understand, and please don't go and Google, because I think it's from a Batman movie, but I don't. I don't think that's the right phrase, but we feel, again, that we will never abandon the Palestinian cause. We have been, since the founding father of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zaid, we've been long-standing supporters of the Palestinian cause and will remain to do. And this is an important step in finding that peaceful and just solution. So we can understand, you know, this is a very emotive issue, a very delicate issue, and we understand that, but we want to create that space. Sorry for sounding like a, but it's not sort of a passive mantra. It really is we've got to be better at dialogue and diplomacy. I totally agree. As I mentioned earlier, at the end of the day, what we're trying to do here is cooperation, not confrontation. It's having a, we want to build on that. We want to demonstrate that working together brings benefit for all sides and prove that these benefits are constructive for the coexistence of both states. We do stand, as I mentioned earlier, on the position of Bahrain and when it comes to the Palestinian issue, like any other country. But we're hoping that at the end of this, we would achieve our goal, which is a comprehensive solution for the conflict going on. Next question from the audience. We'll go to the member second in foreback with a yellow card. Yeah, yeah, you. You. Microphone. Hi, my question's mainly to Madam Ambassador. A question should be directed to all three. Very well. Well, then I'll ask this. Would you, assuming the Palestinians were in favor of it, support a two-state solution where the Palestinians have some sovereignty over the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, assuming this is secular and there's some sort of disarmament agreement. And if the Palestinians were in favor of this, would you support it? And do you have a plan to try and bring something like that about in accordance with the 1967 borders? We are primarily here to talk about the Abraham Accords, but I will ask the panelists for answers. Your Excellency, do you want to go first? We would love to see peace with our neighbors, the Palestinians. In order to achieve that, you need to have leadership that is willing to sit and negotiate with Israel. Unfortunately, in the last few years, the Palestinians refuse to have a direct negotiation with any Israeli leader. So while people are asking us, what will be the endgame? We need to speak about the beginning of it. So you cannot have the end if you don't have the beginning. And the beginning cannot happen without starting a negotiation. Now, from our point of view, the biggest barrier to peace was the refusal to recognize Israel as a Jewish state. That was always the biggest barrier. And the way we see it, the way to move forward will start, maybe actually I have a very good role models here, from education for peace. unfortunately we don't get to see education for peace under the Palestinian Authority textbooks and what the kids are learning is more pure anti-Semitism than the vision of having future peace with the Jews and with Israel. And I think this is the place to start and this is the place to begin. So many people are interested in the end game while I'm saying at the moment there is not that the Palestinian leadership is divided and, you know, we have a Palestinian Authority doesn't even control terrorism hubs inside the Palestinian Authority areas. So we are in a serious problem that is not going to be fixed by, you know, putting slogans on the table. We need to have content of education, of building infrastructure with the young generation, not getting to the point where a 13-year-old boy is taking a gun and trying to kill people, innocent Jews from the other side. I think this is the place to begin. And I think when we will have that, we will have peace. Your Excellency, what is the UAE doing to try and persuade Palestine to come to the negotiating table, if anything? The UAE is maintaining open lines of communication. You know, with the Palestinians, I keep going back to this presidential statement, but we'll do all we can and I think the UA has always had this ethos of having open communication to ensure that the space is there for them to dialogue but we continue to support them you know by sort of piloting stuff at the council in terms of guarantees for financial aid you know so I think you know with time they'll recognize that we're a trusted broker all right let's another question for the audience preferably about the Abraham Accords and to all three panelists. Look to the member there with his hand, hi, yeah, you. One is I turning to write, yeah. Well, thank you very much. I welcome all the representatives, very generous of them to come to speak to us. Since it was a point of negotiation in the lead up to the accord, and you've already mentioned it, Mr. President, the issue of settlements in the West Bank. We've spoken about the importance of the freeze on settlements. What about the already existing settlements? Are they not impediments to a free state solution, which I presume all free governments are still committed to? Thank you very much. Mr. Allam, do you want to go first on this? If I may add on this, just to get back on this, I don't think it was a, as mentioned, a thing, I think that it wasn't a prerequisite. It's something that's being negotiated and is being discussed as we go along. And such issues when it comes to domestic affairs take some time in order to resolve. So this is my intake on it. Any comments from your Exence? I think we have to recognize that the Accords sort of emerged from a crisis, you know, and let's be very clear, you know, certainly the UAE supports a two-state solution on 967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital. You know, how we get there and how we get there is not really for possibly the UAE and Bahrain to determine. It's really for Palestinian people and the Israelis to determine, you know, but we will just use all our efforts to kind of move that in the right direction. U.S.S.S. has two parts of that question for you. One, does Israel support a two-state solution? and second of all, does the requirement to freeze settlement building not actually help us get there? So let's start with the settlements, because this is what the gentleman was asking about. At 2005, Israel made a decision to withdraw from Gaza Strip. All the settlements were moved, and people were hoping to see Gaza as the big experiment of peace. And what people were saying back then, when Israel did this very, very hard step, many people were against it because they said, wait a second, we don't know if from security aspect it will be a good thing to do. So people said, look at Gaza. It's a beautiful coastline, and it will become Middle East Singapore. That was the assumption. And we hoped, we hope to be wrong about that. But unfortunately, even though there was not even one settler or one settlement left in the Gaza Strip. What happened in the end and the result was Hamas to control of the Gaza Strip and it just became another way to fight Israel in order to make sure Israel won't exist and over... It happened under blockade some of that times. No, but this is important to mention Israel was withdrawing to the international borderline with Gaza and unfortunately it made terror extremer and unfortunately it creates miserable life to the Gaza people because of the leadership of Hamas. So this is the reality. And from my point of view and from Israel's point of view, settlements were never the issue. And when we uprooted all the settlements, it never brought peace. And we tried that in the past and it just didn't help. So we need to understand what are the problems in order to find the solutions. The Israeli government today support negotiation, supports peace and it's open-minded to creative solutions because obviously the two-state solution has failed and it's quite clear that today none of the Palestinian leaders are supporting that in a way because even Mahmoud Abbas is not willing to sit and negotiate about a two-state solution and it's quite clear it's time for us to be more creative and I think this is why we need to take inspiration from those agreements. The Abraham Accords were a creative way to create strong connections in the region. If you're saying Israel really to find a more creative solution, is that a fancy way of saying we should abandon the two-state solution? I think the two-state solution was abandoned by the Palestinians. They were the first people that said no every time that an Israeli government, together with American interfere, together with American mediators, were offering that. They said no in 2000. They said no in 2006. So this was refused by the Palestinians. So Israel will no longer pursue a two-state solution? We believe that under the circumstances where 50% of the Palestinians being led by Hamas terror organization, this is not the way to go. You need to build a future leadership that is willing to start and think about the future of the children, both sides. And I think we're so far away from that before we take care of the educational issue. And I'm saying again, the Israeli government is for peace, always. We have time for two more questions, again, preferably about the Abraham Accords, preferably to all three people. Go to the member here in the daisy covered top. This is to all members, and it's about the Abraham Accords. Did your country push for the inclusion of Palestine in signing these accords? And if not, does that imply that your country does not believe that Palestine should be its own state or is its own state? The question was, did your country push for Palestine to be one of the signatories of the Abraham Accords? And if not, does that represent your country's belief that Palestine is not or should not be a real state? Mr. Alam, do you want to go first? See, at the end of the day, whether a country wants to sign or not, that's a sovereign decision for it. Nobody is going to push anyone else to do whatever they want. If they see that it's necessary, then they will do it. This is one point. The second, whether they've signed or not, again, I reiterate. We support the two-state solution. We do recognize Palestine and we do recognize Israel. I think there would be nothing, there's nothing in the Accords to my knowledge that would prevent Palestine from joining the Accords. I think they're so central and fundamental to the objective of the Accords. But, you know, we would have, that would be a sort of objective. I think they're so fundamentally built into the accords that you can't not have Palestine within them. Your Excellency. Can you repeat the specific question? Did your country, did Israel push for Palestine to be included in the Abraham Accords? And would you want them to be included in the Arab Accords? So I'm saying again, in the future, definitely we would like to see the Palestinian joining the peace circle. But the Abraham Accords was born because the Palestinians were, So we thought that it will be a good thing to move and to keep on, you know, achieving peace. So I would say even though we want them to be part of it, they refuse to be part of it. One more question. We go to the member. We please hand up first at the back there. Yeah, you. So as you know, under international law, Israel does not have a right to the West Bank. UN 242 says that Israel must withdraw to June 67 borders. Not only has Israel not withdrawn, but according to human rights groups like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, even Israeli groups like Betzelam, Israel is carrying out apartheid in the occupied territories and violating the Fourth Geneva Convention by transferring its civilian population to the West Bank. My question is, why do you flout international law and why do you support apartheid? So to rephrase that, I suppose, in a way that... To rephrase that in a way that, I suppose, applies to all panellists. To CIPI, the question as it was worded, and the other two, do you feel comfortable having normalized and diplomatic relations with a country that, in the gentleman's words, is in breach of international law, the UN and the Geneva Convention? We'll go to CIPI first. Israel is a democracy, and we're very proud. of our democracy and the UK is very proud of Israel's democracy and this is why we have such a strong bilateral ties. All British prime ministers used to see Israel as a like-minded country when it comes to values. So we definitely are very, very proud to be a democratic country. Human rights is something we appreciate so many human rights organizations are active in Israel because we are our democracy, because we open our doors for any kind of supervision, any kind of criticism, we're open to that. And I think this is something we all should be proud of. Coming back to your question, just looking at Israel's infrastructure, 20% of Israeli population are Arabs. And just lately, there were the third largest party in the Israeli parliament. Either you need to learn what is apartheid or you need to watch how Israeli democracy operates because 20% of our population are Arabs that are proud to be Arabs. And actually one of the representatives of this community that is a member of parliament was asked once, were you willing to live in Palestine if you be afford to have a passport? And he said, I prefer to live in Israel because Israel is a democracy. And unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority for the last 10 years didn't agree to have election. So we're talking to about a regime that doesn't want to have free election, and in the Israeli side, we are probably too many elections, so that's the case. Mr. Alam, do you agree that Israel has in breach of international law and the Geneva Convention? Well, yeah. At the end of the day, this is a sovereign country. It has its sovereign decision, and it's for them to decide whatever approach they take. We usually do not interfere in such issues and do not interfere in internal, affairs of other countries. Do you then reject the authority of international law or the relevance of it? I did not say that. But if you said that internal matters are for a sovereign state's own decision, even if they're in contravention or alleged contravention of international law, surely that implies the same thing. Well, that would be for the state itself to take it with the UN bodies and discuss with them together. Your Excellency. Very much agree with Hussein's words that this has to be addressed through the UN, but would remind the gentleman who asked a question that we support an independent Palestinian state in line with UN resolutions and international law. I'm afraid we've come to the end of the talk. So the final question from me to all of our representatives here is what is the future for the Abraham Accords and for peace and prosperity? in the Middle East. We'll start with Mr. Alam. Well, I see a great potential. I see a lot of development. I see more of the security, stability, coexistence, and achieving the utmost that wasn't achieved in the past tens of years. Your Excellency. First of all, I agree with you. And just to say something for my personal experience. I feel like I'm part of historic moment. And I really feel like we achieved so much in just two years. So just to think about what the future can bring, if just in two years, our very, very hardworking ambassadors together with the spirit of the leaders, they achieved so much. So I think it's going to be a top priority, I think for all the leaders of our countries to keep on working together and keep on achieving together. And I think maybe the future will go to more cooperations that will impact, you know, part of our working group. We have a nice lobby in Parliament. And the idea is to bring the UK to be part, maybe, of the NEGA Forum. We would like to see Western presence in promoting the Abraham Accords and thinking together about challenges we all have and how we can help each other. actually I see a very, very big impact also on this side of the world from the Abraham Accords. And to finish off the panel discussion, Your Excellency. Just to say, I think a very promising future, you know, this is something that has happened within the region. It was facilitated through the US, but it's happened in the region. It's a vacuum that's been filled by regional players now. And I think one day we can hopefully move towards something that builds upon Camp David, the Oslo Accords by possibly Abrabi or Tel Aviv. You know, I think we have to think in that it's not going to be easy getting there. We need to build the trust. We need to build the Abraham Accords is just starting, is what I'd say, in my final words. Give it a chance. Allow it to breathe. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for joining us. And thank you being such a... structure engaged Curtis and the back for audience.
