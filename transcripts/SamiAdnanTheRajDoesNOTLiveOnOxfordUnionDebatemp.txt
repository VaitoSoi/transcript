 I now look to the field and primary healthcare student from Reuben College, Sami Adnan, to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you, Mr. President. It is such an honor to speak in this historic chamber for tonight motion as we celebrate the platinum jubilee of Her Majesty's reign that has seen the end of colonization and the beginning of cooperation. Members of the House, it is also indeed an honor to speak here as the first ever elected member of the committee from Ruben College, the 39th College of the University of Oxford. I must say, when I first saw the motion of tonight's debate, I was confused. Of course, I am on the same page with Dr. Shashitur, MP, whose Oxford Union speech later became highly recommended read called the Inglorious Empire, what the British did to India. But you will be convinced how the idea of the RAD still living on is utterly absurd, as I make my case for the opposition of the recovery of the subcontinent by focusing on Bangladesh, how the latest, how the latest non-Raj nation has been developing at a record-breaking pace. Once called a basket case has proven itself as a rising star in Asia. Even during the height of the pandemic, Bangladesh had a GDP growth of 3.5 percent, while neighboring countries' GDP had shrunk below negative, and the UK was down minus 9.4. For the 2022 fiscal year, the projections of Bangladesh GDP growth is 7.5% and is on track of becoming a developed country in the next 15 years. But before we further delve into the subcontinent's promising comeback, let us ponder a little bit on the past so that we can better contextualize the current scenario. So Brexit, sorry I deny. So Brexit took almost four excruciating years for a mere severance. from a political union that was established just 30 years ago, multiple prime ministers and general elections, and even between 10 years of speakers of the House of Commons, to get Brexit done. To get the partition done, it took Lord Mountbatten just two weeks to decide the fate of millions of people, and this was after the Raj had ruled for 200 years. The contrast is striking to say the least. Keeps one questioning about the moral very, values, highest echelons of education and the Enlightenment. But yes, the reasons were also very different. In 1905, Lord Karzon, a fellow Oxonian from Balliol College, and a member of this house, first partitioned Bengal on the basis of administrative efficiency, with the criteria being religion. It was through dividing and conquering, and as Dr. Therr said, by looting that the subcontinent was the subcontinent that was contributing to one third of the global GDP was brought down by famine and had reached extreme poverty. The industrial revolution in the UK was financed by the asset transfer. What started in 1608 by the Mughal Empire allowing a small trading post on the west coast of India to the English East India Company was soon taken advantage of. And to build the rest of Europe, companies followed, like the French East India Company, the Dutch East India Company, and you get the idea. After the brutal murder of George Floyd, racism was a brief topic of discussion in continental Europe. And again, I stumbled upon black peat controversies. Members of the House, that is another debate on its own. But I was surprised to know that Dutch colonialism ended as recent as the 60s and when they officially stopped colonizing and tormenting Indonesia as its last victim. Even more surprising is that decolonization of Africa took till the 80s. The mimicking of colonial atrocities by Japan in East Asia is still fresh in the minds of many Koreans and many in the neighboring peninsulas. Would it be fair to say that their former rulers still have influence on them, or, for lack of a better word, are still ruling them? Of course not. It is easy to criticize the Indian subcontinent, as it is easier said than done. As described by the philosopher Norbert Elias, Europe went through an extensive civilizing process over centuries. given the subcontinent was subject to 200 years of colonial rule, the recovery in the last 70 years or 75 years is impeccable, a true demonstration of resilience, perseverance, and can-do attitude. Although the British ruler had cut off the thumbs of artisan weavers so that the finest Bengal-Muslim cloth couldn't be made anymore, After the independence, Bangladesh reinvented itself by early adopting technology and leveraging its expertise and now has one of the largest garment industries in the world. I can assure you a lot of the clothes that members of the house are wearing tonight is either from Bangladesh or the subcontinent. On a short notice, if you need 30,000 T-shirts for the Premier League fans, Bangladesh is the only place that can deliver. The subcontinent did not only help build Europe, but since its independence, Bangladesh provided Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Middle East and other countries with semi-skilled labor force necessary for their infrastructural development. And this hardworking class is currently the biggest remittance earner for the country. Bangladesh is home to one of the largest agricultural universities in Asia, constantly setting a higher bar for food. security and biodiversity. Feeding people with self-sustaining crops and lifting people out of poverty who were subject to famine caused by the Raj to support the troops during the Second World War, as many times previously argued in this chamber. Bangladesh is fourth in the world in rice production, third in the world in fish production, also third in the world for fast-growing vegetable production, fifth in the world for aquaculture, and seven in the world in terms of mango production. You have to realize this is a country smaller than East Germany, I mean former East Germany, but has doubled the population at 160 million. The new era of digital Bangladesh has enabled mobile banking to the most remote corners of the country with transactions over $2 billion a day. It was one of the very first countries to implement digital vaccine certificates, including residential, registration, prioritization, management of vaccine deployment during the pandemic. Life expectancy has risen to 75 years from 65 years just within the last decade. Literacy rate has increased 73% from 43% within the last two decades. With an aid to GDP ratio of less than 2%, Bangladesh is no longer an aid-dependent country. Bangladesh has always been ahead to meet the targets to achieve the MDGs and now the SDGs. Bangladesh has achieved miracles, acing social indicators such as maternal and child death, sanitization facilities, gender and development, women education, and women empowerment. Latest reports by the UN highlights that gender pay gap in Bangladesh is just 2.2% against the world average of 21.2%. At Oxford, I recently discovered this was 13.7 last year. Sorry, Edina. As Professor Harari, another fellow Oxonian, often says, history has a tendency of repeating itself. This is why constantly remembering the past keeps us from making those same mistakes again. We have all seen the rise of populism in Europe in the recent years. I have personally experienced how unwelcome I felt. felt at times as a high-skilled expat in EU states. The tribal instincts are inherent. The hate crimes against Asians at the beginning of the pandemic just demonstrated how easily we can regress to these tribal instincts. Centuries of development and going through civilizing process can be undone by one incident, by one person, by one vile idea. Such is the fragility of our civilization. There is still so much work to be done, so many actions to be taken. Tonight I'm wearing black tie, not because it's a symbol of our colonial past, but as a symbol of equality and equity, as a symbol of recognition. I too from Bangladesh can stand here tonight as an equal to my contemporaries and say a thing or two about the RAD. I think in many ways that says a lot about the RADs than that says about me. Members of the House, I would like you to strongly consider the future that the subcontinent is now working towards and vote for the opposition by exiting the nose this evening. Thank you.
