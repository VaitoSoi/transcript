 And I'll look to Dr. Catherine Bragg to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you, Mr. President, for the invitation to speak in this House on this very timely motion. is indeed an honor. Ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to the preceding members for the proposition. You would have thought that the motion before the House tonight was this House believes in open borders. Let's remind ourselves that the motion tonight is this House would abolish borders. What this House has not heard is how borders can be abolished. that is, what are the realistic steps in international politics where one or some or all of the current nation states would declare themselves no longer having borders? It's hard to imagine any single state unilaterally declaring itself borderless when others do not. The detriment of that state is obvious. Sovereign states could voluntarily merge with another one, such as the reunification of eastern West Germany, or a group of nations would combine to internally eliminate some features of borders, such as the case of the European Union. But in all cases, the combined political entity carries a combined border. I'm hard-pressed to think of any possible international intergovernmental process that would result in all the nation's states of the world mutually agreeing to the elimination of the borders. I think it is a fallacy to think that the trajectory of human progress is to go from plans to villages to formal polities such as principalities, then nations, then eventually supranational structures towards a world government. It's a seductive proposition because humans have and do become more and more. capable of creating and appreciating bigger and bigger problems. And we slipped into thinking that the size of governance should correspondingly become larger. History actually shows the opposite. Entities of polarity combined, often by force, and the biggest of them in history were empires. And then inevitably the large ones break up again. the end of the Second World War, empires were no longer PC, that's politically correct. And the last coming together of nations, not by conquest, but by economics and technology, was the recent decades of globalization. The heyday of globalization coincided with the period of unipolarity, not unlike previous empires. And not unlike empires, the inevitable fracturing is already happening. And I believe that a member for the proposition has even written a book on the end of globalization and what we should do with that afterwards. Pundits, including our member for the proposition, has opined that the world economy and geopolitics are rearranging into two or three dominant blocks. The western and Chinese economic zones are already becoming apparent. The Ukraine invasion has hardened the demarcation between NATO and Russia. The will to march towards borderless integration is demonstrably waning. Without that will, there simply is no feasible pathway for global abolition of borders as a collective project in the imaginable future. I too would like to invite this House to consider the benefits of border, as Abigail has also done. Since the end of World War II, there have been some 40 major or minor incidents of aggression aimed as seizure of territory and changing boundaries. Since the creation of the United Nations, there has only been one instance of a member state invading to take over another member state, and that was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. In the post-second World War period, all of the success of states that emerged from the breakup of existing states, USSR, Yugoslavia, Sudan, etc. They have all kept the former internal administrative boundaries as the new international boundaries. So compared to interstate conflict, which number in dozens every year, interstate conflict is in fact quite rare. and that's why the invasion of Ukraine is so shocking and unexpected. The unprecedented 75 years of relative interstakes stability, if not peace, is buttressed by international law on territorial integrity, which is supported by all of the major international organizations, including the United Nations, the Arab League, the organization of American states, the African Union, ASEAN, for Asia, and the European Union. So the conclusion is clear. Current political organizations and states regards stability in internationally recognized borders as essential to peace and security. The 75 years of strong territorial integrity norm coincided with the consolidation of the notion of nation states. And I know there are many people who immediately leap to the extreme form of nationalism, which is the rabid racist ethnocentrism. There is actually a more modern form of nationalism. It's civic nationalism that is based on identity, shared values, and citizenship. My country, Canada, practices civic nationalism. By all criteria, Canada is a successful nation state. even as we share the longest undefended border on earth with the United States and we have joined NAFTA the North American Free Trade Agreement. Canadians took pride in distinguishing ourselves from Americans. No offense. We point to our public health system, our welcoming of immigrants, and our support for gun control. Polls show our number one value is tolerance. If you take away the border between us and the Americans, you take away our identity, and 38 Malian Canadians will be worse for it. As a humanitarian, I get all the arguments about the wrongness of closed borders. The injustice of advantage by birth, of citizenship, the willful blindness to the economic advantage of open migration to both sending and receiving countries and the cruelty and the inhumanity of many border control measures. But I'll do a slight deep different take than Abigail. The opposite of closed border is not no border. The idea of global citizenship, the idea of identity, rights, and responsibilities, transcending geography and political boundaries, has already gained much traction in many countries' educational, curriculum in the UK, in my country in Canada, and many, many others. Politically, currently at last count, 76% of the countries in the world recognize or accommodate dual citizenship. Many allow remote voting regardless of the state of residency. WTO World Trade Organization, member states have negotiated movement rights for professionals under GATT, general agreement on trade and services. All these advances towards more open borders have come about while preserving the notion of sovereignty, nationhood, and yes, borders. And let's face it, the UK Rwanda asylum proposal under the Nationality and Borders Act is god-awful, not because the UK has a border, but because of the god-awfulness of a government that actually thinks that proposal is okay. trans-border issues including migration do require transnational solutions. One pathway to transnational solution without disregarding borders and sovereignty is international cooperation and multilateral agreements by signatory states. The recent minimum corporate tax initiatives through the OECD, the Geneva Convention on the Rules of Armed Conflict under the auspices of the International Red Cross Movement, and, dare I say, the Paris Accord on Climate Action under the auspices of the United Nations are examples that readily come to mind. Critics of multilateralism has always denigrated these agreements, particularly the Paris Accord, as worthless because there's no enforceability. The workability of multilateral agreements is in the willingness of signatory stakes to take on individual responsibilities in setting national. national policy framework for localized action. And this is where those agreements would prove their worth. I am also finding better institutional solutions to enforcement, but let's ask, if there is a supranational body of enforcement, who do you think is the target of enforcement? Eventually, it still comes back to the jurisdiction of signatory stakes and the polity within administrative borders. So borders matter. And if there really is no feasible political process to abolish borders, it seems evident that the motion before this House must fail. The
