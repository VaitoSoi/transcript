 Members of the House, we live in an age where human rights protections are entrenched both under international and national laws. However, the very countries that are parties to these conventions are often at the forefront of their violations. from NATO's war crimes in Afghanistan to the China's crimes against humanity of Uyghur Muslims, and now Russia's alleged crimes in Ukraine. The 21st century has given rise to many allegations of war crimes. While the Rome Statue gives the International Criminal Court jurisdiction over genocides, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crimes of aggression, the court itself has been very reluctant in taking decisive and decisive actions against the powerful states. It is within this background that we turn to our panel to discuss whether there is any hope for international accountability. And we will start with each speaker giving their introductory remarks, starting with Mr. Roth. Thank you. All right. Well, thank you. It's my pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. I mean, it's very hard in five minutes to give a survey of international justice. But let me try to do a quick one. You know, I think we started off in this era with some significant successes. If you'll go back and look at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, you know, it convicted many people, you know, including senior figures. You know, Milosevic, you know, almost was convicted if he hadn't died on during trial, but you know, Miladich and Karasdich all had their day in court and were convicted. The Rwanda Tribunal was able to convict many Genesee-Dare, although completely failed to go after the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which is now, you know, was then led by Paul Kagami, currently, the president for the 30,000 summary executions that it committed during and in the aftermath of the genocide. So it was a very partial justice effort there. You know, we saw the special courts fear Sierra Leone going so far as to get Charles Taylor, who was convicted, the former president of Liberia. The Cambodia tribunal was a disaster because the UN agreed to basically allow the Hun Sen government to control it, and so nothing happened to speak of. When we come to the international criminal court, if we're going to be honest, we have to be disappointed by how little it has accomplished in its now 20 plus years. And as is well known, every case so far that has been brought has involved Africa. And there just have been very few cases. And it's partly the problem of limited jurisdiction. So the ICC did not have jurisdiction over Syria, as one example. They don't have jurisdiction over, you know, things that are happening in China, things that are happening in Russia, things that are happening in the United States, you know. They obviously do have territorial jurisdiction over those nationalities when they commit crimes in a member state. But, you know, that has, there are big gaps in its jurisdiction. And it also has suffered by a lack of political backing. You know, why is Omar al-Bashir still sitting in a Sudanese prison rather than in the Hague? You know, because nobody's really pushing to get him there. Now, There has been, first of all, it's just worth noting some effort to compensate for the limitations of the ICC through national courts exercising was known as universal jurisdiction. And, you know, most prominently, we saw a German court in Koblenz in this past year convict a Syrian military intelligence officer for crimes against humanity by running a torture site. That was, you know, very important. He happened to be in custody. He was, you know, had came to Germany as a so-called refugee and was discovered. What European governments have not done yet is to exercise universal jurisdiction over people who are not in custody. So for example, there was no effort to go up the chain of command in Syria, to go after, you know, Assad or Putin or others who were responsible for, you know, targeting hospitals or using chemical weapons or the like. Today we are at a potential turning point with Ukraine in that there has been an enormous outpouring of support. I mean, I at this point there I think are 43 governments that have formally referred, you know, the case to the ICC. I took part in an informal UN Security Council hearing about a month ago where it was like one government after the other, you know, endorsing the need for justice. People have thrown money at the ICC, which is a bit problematic because, you know, it's A lot of this money is supposed to be focused on Ukraine. Now I think Karim Khan, the current prosecutor, is refusing to take money just for Ukraine, which is the right thing to do. He should insist on money for the court to maintain its independence. But, you know, we see this selectivity here. Everybody's interested in justice for Ukraine, but, you know, where is the comparable interest for other awful situations? Now, there are many people looking at war crimes in Ukraine, including Human Rights Watch. We've had investigators on the ground, you know, throughout the conflict. The Ukrainians themselves are making a very significant effort to document war crimes, and they've already pursued, you know, a handful of cases against Russian soldiers who happen to be in custody. European governments are again using universal jurisdiction and are investigating. The interesting thing about the ICC is, of course, you know, Kareem Khan is devoting attention to this, But there has been a shift in the position of the U.S. government, which is worth noting. Even though the Rome statute gives jurisdiction for any, you know, relevant crime committed in the territory of an ICC state, regardless of the nationality of the perpetrator, the U.S. position, you know, contrary to the letter of the law, has been, you can't prosecute an American because we didn't ratify the treaty, you know, which is to say, you know, Americans who commit a war crime, even in an ICC state, should get impunity. And that is why Trump imposed, outrageously imposed sanctions on Fatou bin Suda, the last ICC prosecutor, because she was looking at U.S. torture in Afghanistan, Afghanistan being an ICC state. Now, you know, Biden withdrew those sanctions. That was the right thing to do. The interesting thing, though, is that the Biden administration has endorsed the ICC investigation of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, even though Russia is not an ICC member. So is this a principled shift or is it just a shift out of convenience to put pressure on Putin? The test is going to be what happens in Palestine because Palestine has ratified the ICC treaty. Israel has not. The U.S. has objected to ICC prosecutions. You know, imagine going after, say, Netanyahu for overseeing the settlements, which are clear war crimes, you know, violations of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. It's a pretty easy case to make. The U.S. objection has been, you know, one, Palestine is not a state, but that's a general assembly issue, which says that they are a state, so that's kind of done with. But the other has been, Israel didn't ratify the ICC treaty, which should be utterly irrelevant if it commits its crimes in the territory of an ICC state, i.e. Palestine. What is the US position going to be there? We don't know yet. What is Karim Khan's position going to be on this? You know, he has, and I'll conclude with this, you know, the good news is that he is a kind of a very experienced litigator. He knows, you know, how to make cases. He's not afraid of being in court. And he, I think, rightfully, is trying to narrow the number of investigations in order to maximize the results. And that's a completely fair decision. The issue for Karim Khan is whether he is making political decisions or is he judging on the merits. And so, for example, when it came to Afghanistan, he conveniently said, oh, well, since the Taliban took over, we're going to look forward, not back. You know, we were going to look at the Taliban crimes, but we're not going to look at history. So that was a convenient way of saying, you know, therefore we're not going to look at U.S. torture in Afghanistan. So we kind of got rid of that problem with Washington. What's he going to do about Israel? I don't know. You know, but that's really a test of whether, you know, he is willing to go after the important non-African cases. And it will be a test of whether the Biden administration is willing to adopt a principled approach to ICC jurisdiction rather than trying to protect itself and its friends. I'll stop there. Thank you. Mr. Saabi, your initial comments on 21st century war crimes and international justice and accountability. As Mr. Rod said, it's a very big issue, and to cover it over five minutes, it's almost impossible, but I'll do what I can. My expertise, of course, is not in ICC. I spend most of my human rights career in doing people's tribunals. The reason that people's tribunals, I think, would serve the present situation is because there is such a huge gap in the system. You have an international criminal court that has limited power in respect of the big guys. The three permanent members of the UN Security Council, United States, Russia and China, are not members of the ICC. Their states are not part of the jurisdiction of this tribunal. They support the tribunal, they funded, they even sent cases through Security Council to the International Criminal Court. So the law is good, the practice is good, but it's only for other people. Americans shouldn't be tried by the International Criminal Court, Russians shouldn't be, Chinese should not be. But every other states, in Africa, in any other country that is part of it, it's okay. It's okay. So there's all that it says the law is for the little people, not for the big ones. So that creates a gap. If you go through the record of ICC, they've done fantastic work. You can see how many people they have arrested, how many they have prosecuted. And I think it's, all of them deserve to be prosecuted. But you don't see anybody. with the name starting with George Bush or Rumsfeld or Cheney or Tony Blair or Putin or President G. They are not there and they will never be there when this system is. So from 1968 when Bertrand Russell and Jean-Portzart decided to create a people's tribunal with no power, but just to bring people to explain what atrocity had been committed by a great power like United States, which had gone away with impunity all years that they had been involved in Vietnam and creating all these atrocities. That created a forum for people to see that it's possible to bring a great power to the book, try it, try it, bring witness, bring evidence, and see what's the result of that one in the Court of Public opinion. Now Russell tribunal was followed by many other tribunal in 2012 we set up Iran tribunal which was a great success and I will deal with the small outcome of that one as well and then we did China tribunal on a very terrible issue China tribunal on organ, forced organ harvesting of the political prisoners. This is one of the most horrible cases I've ever seen. That's where Chinese government for profit, pure profit. They arrest political prisoners, they use their organs for selling it to Oregon tourists. Now this is a crime of the crimes, that you do that for the pure profit. It's been done from 2003 for many years. The China Tribunal issued its judgment in 2019, and there is no reaction. But it has fulfilled that one, its reporter. And they have continued with the organ harvesting. Now they have found a new client for that. You got, Oigurs are Muslims. The Muslim word is a very rich word. They think about everything else, about their fellow Muslim citizens. The rich Gulf state Muslims, Muslims would like what they call halal organ for the replacement of their failed organs. So the Chinese government had produced halal organs. If you go to Kashgar, at the airport there is a green line for people to go to organ harvesting and hospitals that provide this service. After the China Tribunal, we did the Oigur Tribunal, and the judgment came out on 9th December last year, finding the Chinese government had committed genocide against the Uyghurs, and after that we did the Iran Atrocities Tribunal about the massacre of the demonstrators, peaceful demonstrators, in November 2019. I'll go back briefly to the issue of the power of people's tribunals, they provide an alternative remedy. But what's the point of getting a judgment that has no force? Getting, organizing a tribunal that cannot subpoena witnesses, cannot force people to give evidence or documents, or cannot put the offenders in jail. It is what it can be done, as John Pouls said in 1968, 68 at the opening of the Russell tribunal, said our power is in our powerlessness. It is the court of public opinion that we appealed to. The success of Russell tribunal was the entire war turned against Americans and the American atrocity in Vietnam. And Americans were forced to leave Vietnam. The other tribunals have this effect. I mean, in particular if you look at the Comfort Women Tribunal, women tribunal that dealt with the sexual slaves that the Japanese had during the war. The Japanese government was forced to adopt the decisions of the tribunal, although it always declared that it's not a legitimate tribunal, but they were forced to accept it. In 1988, the government of Iran, after losing the war to the Iraqis and taking a peace, decided to eliminate their political prisoners. Just went through this. These are the political prisoners who had not committed any violent crimes. All those who committed violent crimes against the regime in 1980s were executed anyway. So those who were just carrying a leaflet or participating in some movement, they were left in prisons. In summer of 1988, they went through the prisons, and basically cleared out the prisons. Thousands and thousands of youngsters were executed after asking two, three silly questions. Do you believe in Islam? Do you believe? Or whatever it was, they ended up in mass graves. This was kept as a secret for years. The Iranian government lied to the at least three UN human rights rapporteurs as to the fate of the people who had disappeared. until we set up the tribunal in 2012, some 75 witnesses gave evidence, and suddenly this wall of denial crashed. Everybody in the regime was trying to distance themselves from this massacre, saying, no, I would never agree to it. I wasn't part of this. And eventually it didn't work, because many of them were involved to the Hilton. So they started finding other excuses. But then they couldn't deny this anymore. The Trinidio produced the report, and this is the result of the Truth Commission, that 75 witnesses gave evidence. There is a small line in the whole thing that one of the perpetrators that is listed here is a Kyle called Hamid Nuri, also known as Abbasi. as Abbasi, just a one-line sentence. I think you should pass this around and see at the bottom here. Pass, share it with the other's bottom. This character was passing through Stockholm in November 2019. And on the complaint of some of the other victims of that, He was arrested by the Swedish police. And he has been tried for crimes against humanity, mostly based on the evidence that this tribunal produced, war crimes and crimes against humanity. And the judgment will come out exactly a month from today on 14th July this year. There were some 60 people testified against him when he was in the, that they said that he was one of those who was responsible for this mis- atrocities. I think I've exceeded my time. Yes. I'll stop here if necessarily, I'll come back to the question. Well, thank you very much for those comments. I now invite Mr. Huadayar to give his thoughts and also maybe to talk about his case of the in the International Criminal Court. Thank you. As Mr. Roth explained earlier, the International Criminal Court was set up following the success of the Yugoslavian tribunal after the Yugoslavian wars. And the aim of the ICC, as it states in its mandate, is to prosecute and punish those that are engaged in the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. And that is exactly what is happening in East Turkestan or what the Chinese government calls Xinjiang, to the Uyghur and other Turkic populations. But for the longest time, we had been unable to obtain a legal path or legal way to obtain justice for our people to get the international community, governments, and international institutions to act. But in I believe December or November of 2019, the International Criminal Court, they decided to open up investigations on Myanmar and Bangladesh over the Rohingya genocide on the basis that part of the crimes that the Myanmar regime was carrying out occurred on the territory of Bangladesh meaning that you know Bangladesh is a member of the ICC and so what's happening in East Turkestan is you know as described by various governments by the Uyghur Tribunal and more recently even by the EU Parliament or last week they described it as crimes against humanity other governments and parliaments have described it as genocide and seeing that we decided that if the Rohingya people have an opportunity to make this case then why should we not be able to make this case and try to obtain justice and to you know seek prosecution of Chinese officials that are responsible for the crimes that are continuing to this day and one of our neighboring countries Tajikistan happened to be a member of the Rome Statute a signatory and a ratifier another member is Afghanistan and another one Kyrgyzstan is They signed but they haven't ratified. So in Tajikistan alone, we discovered that after extensive litigation and extensive on the ground investigation, we discover that the Chinese government using their own police forces, their agents, public security officials, and the officials of Tajikistan's government forcibly deported and kidnapped over 3,000 Uyghurs who were then subsequently disappeared into what we believe are concentration camps and prisons. They have not been heard since. Kyrgyzstan, similarly, they deported in a similar fashion, deported or Chinese agents went in forcibly kidnapped about 4,000 Uyghur's. And now, seeing that the ICC has accepted the Rohingya case, and more recently with the case of what's going on in Ukraine, the pressure of governments and the Rohingya's case were only accepted because of pressure by governments. While, you know, as Mr. Sabi had stated, there is power in the effect of the people, holding people's tribunials and showing the evidence. But at the end of the day, realistically, it's going to take actions by governments, pressure by governments to, and, you know, governments and international institutions, large organizations like Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, to push, you know, the international criminal court to launch investment. and to prosecute and obtain, you know, punish those officials responsible. So in this aspect, it's important that, you know, there is a way for these officials to be punished. There is laws, you know, there is a way for the International Criminal Court to establish jurisdiction. In fact, just because of the situation of the deportation and kidnapping of Uyghur's from Tajik and Kyrgyzstan and Kyrgyzstan, that alone gives them enough jurisdiction to open an investigation into the crimes that is happening, the ongoing crimes that is currently happening against Uyghur and other Turkic peoples. But again, the issue comes to one, the will of the prosecutor, if the prosecutor is willing to do that. The prosecutor has the jurisdiction to do it, but the prosecutor, from our understanding, needs to be, you know, there needs to be some more international pressure, especially from governments and international institutions that the ICC respects. And I think we will be able to obtain justice. Sure, it's not going to come overnight. You know, even the Nuremberg trials lasted several years. Even the Yugoslavian trials lasted several years. But we don't have time to waste. Right now in East Turkestan, people are being killed for their organs and being sold, you know, as halal organs to wealthy Muslims from across the world. Women are being forcibly sterilized. Children are being torn apart from their families and sent to boarding schools and orphanages to be raised as, you know, loyal, quote, Chinese citizens. Our entire future of our people, not just our culture, but our very existence, is being slowly eroded. And it's up to international institutions like the International Criminal Court to investigate this, because we just recently saw from the UN Human Rights Commissioners' visit to East Turkestan. She did not make any statements. You know, she did not call out the Chinese government for its atrocities. On the contrary, she used the same term that the Chinese government used to whitewash its constant. concentration camps and its atrocities stating that, oh, these are vocational training centers and that Uyghur's are being re-educated. You have Uyghurs and other Turkic peoples from all walks of life, from professors to wealthy billionaires among, you know, people who are very high educated, being forcibly sent to these so-called re-education concentration camps under the guise of that, oh, they're going to provide them vocational training. and then subsequently being sentenced to anywhere from five years to life in prison or even execution for bogus crimes of terrorism simply because they are a different people than the majority of that, you know, the People's Republic of China. And if this is not a crime that the ICC or international governments are not going to act against, simply recognizing it as genocide and calling it a genocide and calling it crimes against humanity and offering statements of condemnation are not enough. I personally have lost four relatives that have been killed in these camps. I have 100 relatives that have been disappeared into these camps and prisons. And I'm just one person. There are other Easter Kestanis, every one of us in the diaspora. We have several family members that have either been killed or that are in these camps. camps and their conditions we don't know. We don't know if we will one day be able to return and see at least half of our family members alive or we don't know if they'll be dead before the international community acts. But the international community must act before it's too late and this is why we again thank, you know, Oxford Union for hosting this event because it's important to call on, you know, our governments to pressure the International Criminal Court to call on them to investigate something that they are mandated to do, something that is happening right now at this very moment that is affecting the lives of millions of innocent people. Thank you. Thank you very much for those comments and for giving us an insight into from your perspective of what's happening. One of the common theme that's emerging here in this context is firstly selective justice by the ICC. But then on the other hand, there's also a lack of a disparity when it comes to the international response. For example, to give you a concrete example, in 2020, the ICC opened an investigation into Afghanistan, and they said that there were elements of war crimes committed by the U.S. forces that was stopped and now focused more towards the Taliban. Similarly, the ICC previously had opened an investigation into the Britain's war crimes in Iraq. No actions were taken. But when we now, when it comes to, for example, say, the China's, crimes against humanity or the recent actions by Russia, we see a different response from the international community. There were no people's tribunal formed to investigate the Afghanistan war crimes or the Iraq war crimes, but there are people's tribunals formed by the Western government, within the Western governments to look into what's happening in China and now to pressurize the ICC to look into what's happening in Ukraine. So why are we seeing such a disparity in international response generally? And is there a political motive when it comes to this? We'll start with you, Mr. Well, I mean, yes, obviously certain governments are selective in their pursuit of justice. I mean, even the European governments, which have been the best, the British government obviously was not interested in the ICC investigation into British forces in Iraq. So there is still a tendency to protect your own. You know, I think if you ask you to why was there not a serious effort to look at or U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan or Iraq, you know, part of it is that, you know, Russia, China, actually have no interest in deploying the UN, you know, broadly speaking, the international human rights system generally. You know, I mean, in fact, the Chinese government is going out of its way to undermine that system because it's, you know, rightfully fearful that the system will talk about Xinjiang or, you know, talk about Hong Kong or talk about Tibet or, you know, So there isn't, if you look at the, even just the five permit members of the UN Security Council, you know, three of them have a bad record. You know, Britain has a mixed record and France, you know, tends to be more supportive. So that's, and that's a problem. I mean, if you don't have principled support for justice, you do tend to, you know, undermine it. You make it seem like it's weaponized. And, you know, to this day, if you talk about what you're going to do you know, talk about what's happening in Ukraine, you still get people coming back and say, well, it's not so bad, you know, look what the U.S. did in Iraq, which is not an adequate comeback, but it is, you know, can be a politically effective comeback. So, you know, I think the, you know, the lesson I take from that is that it is important to be principled and to accept that, you know, even one's own war criminals need to be investigated and appropriate prosecuted. But, you know, that's not the position that the U.S. government has been taking, you know, is by, you know, is by, you know, and going to be pushed into a more principled position because of the stance he's taken on Russian war crimes in Ukraine? I don't know yet. You know, even if you look at the way they've endorsed the ICC investigation, it's carefully crafted. I mean, they say we, you know, endorse the collection of evidence, I think they tend to say, which is a little bit short of saying we endorse a formal investigation. And they don't come out and say we endorse prosecution. You know, so they're still playing word games a little bit, but the, nonetheless, I think the shift, even to say collect evidence, is significant because they don't say, you know, collect evidence on U.S. tortured in Afghanistan or collect evidence on, you know, Israeli settlements in Palestine. So, you know, we'll see. But we at least have an opportunity for a more principled position. I mean, a couple months ago, I had a meeting with Anthony Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, and I, you know, said, we noticed. the shift, you know, and I certainly hope that it will be applied consistently. And, you know, I mean, I think Blinken is privately on our side, but, you know, he's still the Secretary of State, so he can't just say anything. So he kind of smiled. And, you know, he knew what I was saying. Time will tell. Well, let's hope that that smile means that he's serious about in terms of principle. Mr. Saabee, just to come to you and also to specifically within this question focus also in the fact that you've been part of the Iran tribunal, you've been recently part of the China's tribunal. Now there's a common theme in both is that there's elements of political West versus the East in there. Why was there no Iraq tribunal? Why was there no Afghanistan tribunal? Are these tribunals this international response political motivation wise? No, the people's tribunals are set up by individuals who think that it will serve the purpose. Iran Tribunal was, I think, the entirely victim led. The political prisoners who came out of Iran mostly got refugee status in Sweden. They set up an organization and they were the organizers of the Iran Tribunal. So it was the victims who organized it. All by all means was a grassroots movement. They later came to the lawyers, including myself, to help them. them. But they decided the whole scenario from the beginning and they were running it. As far as the OIGR tribunal was concerned, it was the World OIGER Congress, supported by other OIGOGOG organizations to set up a tribunal to investigate this. The same with the China Tribunal. You need the organizations, the civil society organizations to make that decision. I don't think we were biased. I had very little knowledge of the forced organ harvesting before being adopted into running that case. Or my knowledge was very limited on the Eugursk. And this wasn't because of any anti-China bias or anything like that. But it's true that we do not have this on a much larger scale. We should have heard it. But I think the governments are reluctant to really take these matters further. Take Mr. Blinken. On his acceptance or on his nomination before the Congress, he was asked whether he believes in what Mike Pompeo said that China is committing genocide. And Blinken is not somebody who would say that without any proper backup and study. And he said, yes, I agree with Mr. Pompeo. I wrote to both of them asking, what's the evidence On what basis did you come to this conclusion? Although the US Embassy acknowledged that the letter was delivered to him, never got an answer. We then raised the issue with the British government. Once the judgment of the Oigur Tribunal come, saying that China had committed genocide, it is the obligation of every government, that at the moment there is evidence that genocide is being committed to take action. So we managed to, with the help of some parliamentarian, led by Nussratqani, to raise the issue in the parliament. And the government says that they don't accept the judgment of a people's tribunal. Fine, don't accept it, but there is evidence of genocide. What are you doing about it? Still playing games because they have a lot more interest to deal with China, so they don't deal with this. And the trouble continues. You heard these people are being raped, attacked, killed, murdered on a daily basis in these camps. And nothing is being done. Thank you. To come to you, Mr. Udayar, in regards to the same theme, a comment from you, but specifically also to put in there that one of the thing that has happened in the past few years is that the Ugar issue has been come very international, whether it's from human rights organizations to governments like the United States. they have raised the issue substantially, although the ICC may not have taken a decisive action. But then comparatively in other areas, the same countries they take on, talk about or raise the Uyghur issues have been silent about other issues like, say, in other countries. What is your thought? Do you think that there is a political motive or not when it comes to these kind of issues? Well, if you, in my opinion, I don't think our issue is being raised enough. And that's, sadly, if you compare it, like let's say, compare it to Ukraine, compare it to the Syria issue, or even the Palestinian issue. Everyone around the world knows about Palestine. Everyone around the world knows about Ukraine. Everyone around the world knows about Syria. But no majority of the people are still unaware about the Uyghur. So in that regard, my opinion is that it's not being raised enough. And governments are not doing enough. They're giving lip service to it. Yes. I think for them, you know, some governments they might find it beneficial to, you know, thinking that, oh, you know, we might use it as leverage for whatever deals that they want behind the scenes with China, but there's nothing being substantially done about it. For example, every government, you know, that have recognized as genocide or every Western government, you know, they are signatories to the UN Genocide Convention. Most of them are signatories to the UN, they have ratified the UN's committee, excuse me, their commitment to prevent genocide and other atrocities. Yet you don't see them fulfilling that. Every government, every year, you know, when it comes around the Holocaust Remembrance Day, whether it's celebrities, governments, they all issue. this one line or this quick tweet never again yet we see never again happening here in the 21st century that's continuing to happen this very moment and governments are not doing anything about it so that's my personal opinion the needs to be more done and international organizations surely need to you know raise this and ask for you know accountability call on the ICC to investigate this because if the UN is not willing to investigate, if the Uyghur Tribunial, people's tribunials are not enough and the ICC is not willing to fulfill its function and what's going to happen? Or is humanity just going to watch and let millions of people be slaughtered on their watch? Let me address, because to say nothing is being done is a little deceptive. And so I think it's useful to say what is being done and what more should be done. Because the, you know, what's happening to the Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang is completely awful. You know, human rights watches characterize it as, you know, the crime against humanity of persecution. And it, you know, there is no more intrusive surveillance state that has been set up. You know, there's no place else where a million people have been detained, you know, which is, you know, out of a population, say, 13 million, you know, so it's, you know, over 10% of the adult population. You know, many kids are just separated from their parents because the parents are detained. And of course, once they're in sort of state schools, they're brought up as Han Chinese, not as Uighurs. So, I mean, it is awful what's going on. There are a few things that have been happening. I mean, maybe most significantly, governments have been condemning this. And there is a fear to condemn China because people are afraid of economic retaliation. You know, they all saw what happened, for example, in Australia, protested against, you know, they said we need to investigate the origins of COVID-19. And suddenly these huge tariffs were starting. slapped on various Australian exports. So everybody's afraid of that. What we've been able to do is go to governments and say there is safety in numbers. If you band together and issue joint condemnations, you won't get economic retaliation, because China can't retaliate against everybody. And so that has been happening every six months or so. There's been a joint condemnation. We just went from 44 to 47 as of yesterday, governments that have been willing to condemn. So, you know, in the first of, It's growing. It still is mostly Western governments. And one of the reasons we were pushing so hard for Bashelai to issue her report is because we see that as kind of a useful tool to bring in, you know, rights supporting governments in Latin America or Africa or Asia. And particularly, you know, the silence has been particularly disappointing has been from many Muslim majority countries. It really has only been, you know, Turkey. Albania and Bosnia that have been willing to speak out. You know, we should at least be seeing Indonesia, Malaysia, you know, Qatar, Gambia, I mean, there are governments that have taken, you know, progressive pro-rights positions in other situations that are not willing to speak out here. What I'd like to see is, you know, for the first time ever, a UN Human Rights Council resolution condemning China. That's never happened. China is extremely attentive to that. And if that were to happen, it would make an enormous difference because they, you know, this is not a government that has elections. They can't say we're legitimate because the Chinese people voted for us. So they looked kind of international acceptance for legitimacy. And if there were a UN condemnation, that would be very powerful. So that's one thing that is kind of happening, but not happening enough. A second thing is that the U.S. government this past December adopted very good legislation, prohibiting imports from Xinjiang as of the end of this. month unless you can prove that the product was not tainted by forced labor, which you can't prove because there's no transparency in supply chains. And so within a couple of weeks, basically all U.S. imports from Xinjiang are going to be borrowed. That's very significant economic pressure. Now the European Union should do the same. Britain should do the same. And so that's a kind of a very concrete thing that can be done. There's no good reason not to do this. You know, it's not like there's a trade war or disastrous, you know, confrontation between the U.S. and China because of this legislation. But it's very useful economic pressure. Now, on the issue of prosecution, I mean, let me if I could explain a bit, because I don't know how familiar people are with the Rohingya case, but the International Criminal Court, even though Myanmar has never joined the court, the court has accepted that it has jurisdiction over the crime of deportation, which is one of the Rome Statute crimes, minds because the, you know, ethnic cleansing that took place against Rohingya was, you know, while there was some killing within Myanmar, a lot of it was demonstration killing with the aim of just, you know, chasing people into Bangladesh. And so the view was, you know, this was a deliberate exercise of mass deportation, which wasn't completed until they stepped over the border. and therefore, because Bangladesh is an ICC member, part of the crime took place on the territory of an ICC member, and therefore the Myanmar general is responsible for these crimes could be prosecuted. Now, we don't have an indictment yet, but the investigation is going. So what you're proposing with respect to the Uighurs, I mean, obviously the aim with the Uyghurs is to get them all within Xinjiang so they can be detained. So it's not an, you know, an expulsion kind of deportation. But the theory is, okay, you know, they were rounding up Uyghurs in Tajikistan, and there was enough of that so that you could say that China was deporting Uyghurs from Tajikistan into China. Now, that's a factual question. I think what's needed to make that case is really to demonstrate that the number of deportations was sufficient to overcome the gravity requirement. That is to say the ICC is only supposed to look at the most global. rave crimes. You know, so it's not just an ordinary crime even if it's a, you know, a murder or whatever, but it's supposed to be, you know, patterns, large-scale crimes. And so what's needed to be shown is that there were enough deportations that really was, you know, a sufficiently mass deportation from Tajikistan to Xinjiang to China to justify ICC involvement. And that's, you know, I think initially a factual question. I don't know the answer to, but that's what needs to be established. And if that case can be made, then pressure can be put on Karin Khan to open an investigation. But that's sort of what needs to be done in order to complete the analogy with the Rohingya. But if I understand from Mr. Dixon's evidence before Oegris, you know, over 90% of the Eurors in Tajikistan were deported. And we're talking about 3,000 people there. No, that's, I mean, I just don't know the facts, but that's what we need to establish. It's a substantial number that had been sent back. And if I make comment on... Quickly, please, because I will have one last question and we'll open to the audience. Because maybe you should open that one. But before that, I do have one last brief response, please. We talk about alternative justice forms. While if the ICC is not doing its job, we are saying people's tribunals, like you've been part of in regards to the China's tribunal and the Iran tribunal. The question then is what legitimacy and impact do such tribunals have in the absence of a more international response or in the absence of international organizations like ICC not giving, who have the mandate to deal with this? The legitimacy is very important. How do we deal with that? The question of legitimacy, of course, is that it can be subjective. What is the purpose of the people's tribunal? To fill in the gap that the international society had left in the justice system. So this is the only alternative presently to that gap. So in that respect is justified. Now if you look at the OIGO Tribunal, the evidence was from those who suffered in the camps. And it was a harrowing evidence of people coming in saying what had happened to them. It wasn't a show. It was real people. We had the real judges sitting there with none of them had any previous involvement with Eugur or China or anything like that. So this is an impartial, independent tribunal looking into this one. Its final purpose is to appeal to the public opinion, to fill in that gap. the missing gap of the justice by, in the court of public opinion, for them to respond to this. And I think you can say it hasn't got any power, which is correct. It cannot subpoena documents, it cannot force Mr. Blinken to come and give evidence. It cannot force anybody to do anything and cannot put the perpetrators in jail. It hasn't got that power, but it has a lot more power in the public opinion. public opinion and I think you can have the confirmation from our friends here. How do you respond to alternative forms of justice like the Tribune? Do we think in your view are they impactful and the question of legitimacy how do you respond to that? I mean I think they are impactful in the fact that they you know shed light on what's going on they raise public awareness about these atrocities but the overall problem here is at the end of the day, is there going to be any action taken? Following on what Mr. Roth said earlier, I mean, yes, there are some things that have been done. For example, yes, they have passed the Uyghur forced labor prevention act, but there are many loopholes in that. For example, you have hundreds of thousands of Uyghurus who have been forcibly relocated, transferred into Chinese provinces, and continue to be used as slave labor there. You have online ads in Chinese selling Uyghurs and you know batches to whatever Chinese company wants to use them so at the end of the day until you engage in massive sanctions like the way the international community responded against Russia's invasion of Ukraine you're it's not going to do anything to impact Uyghurs on the grounds substantially I mean my my family members are still in the camps some have probably some more probably have died I don't know about that we still have millions of people that are in the camps that have been sentenced for bogus, you know, anti-terrorism or anti-so-called terrorist or separatists or extremists simply because they had a beard or they refused to smoke alcohol, smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol, or they believe that, you know, they were different from the Chinese nation and they want to be, you know, separate. These are all reasons. So there has to be significant action taken to stop these atrocities. If not condemnations while they're great, it's not going to change the fact for, you know, the people on the ground who are suffering. Mr. Roth, final quick comment. Are the alternative forms of justice like tribunals impactful? And how do we justify their legitimacy issue? Well, first, let me just quickly. I mean, I think we have to be careful not to make the perfect the enemy of the good. I mean, you know, yes, there clearly is more that can be done. I mean, you know, there are supply chains, so something may be exported from Xinjiang, but go someplace else and be incorporated into a product and then be brought to the United States. I mean, these are, you know, implementation problems that have to be addressed. To get the U.S. government at this stage to say ban all imports from China because of Shenzhang, it's just not in the political currents. You know, so you have to kind of deal in the realm of fragility. And the fact that we got, you know, what we did get is really something. and you know I at this stage would like to see other governments join it even though it's you know it's not perfect by any means and the question of these people's tribunals I mean I guess I look at them really more like truth commissions in the sense that you know there's value just like there's value in a human rights watch report you know there's value in a truth commission that takes testimony and has public hearings and you know brings in you know independent judges to assess the evidence and they reach conclusions It's not a tribunal in the sense that, you know, the accused isn't really represented by counsel. The accused typically doesn't take part in these things. You know, so it's – and tribunal for most people, you know, has – you have a sense of an adversarial process where there are lawyers on both sides who are putting forth their evidence and cross-examining and the like. And that's not typically what happens in people's tribunals. It's usually a one-side presentation of the evidence, you know, akin to a truth commission. But truth commissions are valuable. And so I think it's, you know, I don't, you know, I don't tend to, you know, I guess you can question whether the tribunal terminology is the appropriate one or whether we should call it something else. But the exercise is a useful exercise. Thank you. On that note, we will open the, to audience questions. Anyone, the other member, just there, please? We'll just wait for the mic. Thank you. Yes. Thank you so much. of you. My question is, in the context we find ourselves of increasing nationalism, isolationism, and this super state exceptionalism to the point perhaps of impunity, are there any states or even political figures that are consistently putting personal or national interest aside to kind of push for this global conscience or who are spearheading this condemnation effort to the extent that could actually move the needle on some of these issues. Can we have brief comment from there, please, and then we'll come along the line. Thank you. Yes. If I asked, if I heard the question, right, you're asking, are there any individuals or governments that are pushing aside their national interest or other views to raise this issue? I'd say like in a consistent way, either through, I don't know, sponsoring particular bills or but regardless that element of consistency where it doesn't seem that there's this sort of common thread of having a personal investment. Yeah, yeah, there are certainly many, you know, lawmakers in the United States, even here in the UK, like Nusraudkani, as Mr. Asabi mentioned earlier, that have been consistent in, you know, raising these issues and among other issues. So whether it's in the interest of you know, whatever, you know, for example, in the interest of the UK or not. The UK government surely has not recognized it as a genocide because they don't see it in their interest, but you see parliaments or members of specific parliaments recognizing it as such. So I think, yeah, there are people like that and we need more people like that. But governments as a whole, I mean, let's be realistic. They're going to, they're not going to do anything that's not within their national interest. Mr. Sabi, are there any states or institutions that are very consistent when it comes to raising the idea of international consciousness? I can say that in general terms there were all the Western governments, or in particular we can say the British government, the US government, Australian government and the French government were very supportive. They didn't do anything more than just being supportive. But at least they had that. But what was missing, and absolutely missing from the scene, was a single Muslim country who was supporting. I mean, they are all very fine to support the Palestinian cause, saying that the fellow Muslim brothers are in trouble, which understandable. But here you have over a million Muslims. Because of their race, because of their faith, being treated in this manner. And not a single Muslim country announces anything in support of them. To the contrary, Imran Khan, as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, comes to TV at Farid Zakaria, says, no, my ambassador was in Sinzion and says everything is perfect. How can that possibly be true? And how can a Muslim prime minister say such thing? I did not see anybody from that side helping and to bring this to the level that it will be recognized as Palestinian issue. We need the support of the numbers of these Muslim countries that are claiming so much solidarity with their fellow Muslims to do something. And they are absolutely missing from the scene. The leader of the Islamic Republic had sent a note saying that to his, the commanders of the military side, saying that I do understand that you may sympathize with our Oyghur brothers, but because of our very close relations with China, I ask you not to show any sympathy. This is the response you get, and that is one of the biggest problems that the Oigur community has. Turkey, Egypt, or the countries where the countries where the country, they had fled to and they are collaborating with the China to send them back or to monitor them and create a lot more difficulty for them. You know, it's a little more complicated than that. I mean, Turkey actually has been outspoken about the Uyghurs. And you know, Turkey has the largest Uyghur population outside of Xinjiang. And so it has never joined these joint statements, but it has issued parallel statements on a number of occasions. Albania and Bosnia, I think, are the two only Muslim majority nations that have joined it, actually. I worry about where Turkey is right now, though, because, you know, Erdogan is facing a economic crisis. He has this crazy idea that you meet inflation by lowering interest rates. You know, he's an autocrat. He doesn't listen to advice. And so, you know, the Turkish economy is in deep trouble, and he wants a Chinese bailout. So I actually worry that at this stage, his willingness to go to, you know, to defend the Uyghurs is diminishing. The organization of Islamic cooperation has been a disaster, but that's really kind of run by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia And you know Saudi Arabia has no interest in defending any human rights issue, you know for obvious reasons and I actually sat down with Imran Khan just before the pandemic. He was in New York to promote Kashmir and I said you know great, you know Kashmir certainly deserves attention, but what about the weirs and you know any Basically, you know, he sort of hit a little bit and said, you know, well, you know, we get a lot of funding from China. And at that point, I said, well, you know, your ambassador just said that everything was fine in Xinjiang. Could you at least shut her up? And he sort of said, well, okay, you know, so. But, you know, it's just an embarrassment. I mean, you know, China owns Pakistan and so they're not going to speak out. But it is, I do think, you know, we have many more possibilities that, you know, take a place like Indonesia. And it's a very powerful country. They should be speaking out. It doesn't have the horrible abuses where they would worry about a strong international response on human rights. Malaysia should be speaking out. So I think we should be aiming at these more moderate Muslim majority countries that could be brought on board. And similarly, Latin America has been silent on this. And the Latin American democracies tend to be okay on human rights issues in Geneva. And so they often vote similarly to Western nations, but not on China yet. And that's, you know, I think that's ripe territory to again add votes and make it possible to have a formal condemnation of China for what's happening in Xinjiang. Thank you. We'll take one last question and then that would be the end of this discussion, if anyone has. Can I ask an ICC question because I that involves the case we're on. Is there something to be said for a robust prosecution that does look for innovative ways to go after as many allegations as possible around the world, to make it as universal as possible? There was a mention made early on of narrowing investigations and going deeper, but isn't that something we need to caution against, going for the obvious cases where there's been a lot of outspoken propaganda and attention on the matter, such as Ukraine. I mean, shouldn't we be looking at the Myanmar that was mentioned where there has been an innovation based on the law? It's not something where we're stretching jurisdiction beyond the limits. It's a proper extension of jurisdiction. Potentially, depending on the evidence, yes, the same could apply to Syria and the same could apply to Syria and the same could apply to China as well. These might seem to be more on the fringes, but isn't there something good to be said about a prosecutor going after those cases? We expect it from our national prosecutors not to let people get away with things, to find a way to make the law work. Shouldn't the same apply at the international level? Yeah. I mean, I actually don't quarrel with Karim Khan's efforts to kind of narrow the effort a bit because the ICC was doing too many things. It had limited capacity and as a result nothing was happening you know is pursuing all these investigations and not producing indictments and so if they can do you know more with less let's go for it you know I would not treat the Rohingya as a lesser crime that should clearly should be pursued they don't have jurisdiction in Syria you know Russian China vetoed efforts at the Security Council to refer Syria to the ICC so don't waste your time there's no jurisdiction you know much as I'd like to see it but that's where European countries should be coming in and not just prosecuting people who they have custody of, which is pretty random, but rather, you know, building cases going up the chain of command. You know, why not try to build a case against Assad? Why not build a case against Putin? And, and at this case, you know, in the case of Ukraine, I mean, you know, the ICC clearly will be going up the chain of command there. So, you know, if there are lesser situations, you know, I mean, say Columbia, where, you know, it's a serious situation, but they just were not actively pursuing it. And to finally say, okay, you know, let's just recognize that they're not going to make any progress. there. I'm okay with that if they actually do start making progress in the more important cases. The Israel case, Palestine, it is not a difficult case to demonstrate war crimes with the settlements. They're just like such obvious violations of the prohibition on forced transfer of an occupying powers population into occupied territories. It's a pretty open and shut case. It's the Israeli government policy, just like indict the prime minister already. So there are things that can be done. And I'd rather see the important cases pursued vigorously rather than a bunch of investigations open that never get any place well thank you very much for that comment and with that unless you want to contribute we'll conclude this discussion for today and please join me in thanking our panelists for coming all the way and contributing to this important discussion today I'm
