 Thank you very much for joining us, Mr. Arna. I suppose we should start at the beginning with your... Please call me, Alexandre. Alexander, perfect. At the beginning with your sort of family and upbringing. As the son of Bernardo and then your mum's a gifted pianist and top athlete, you had a sort of very, one might say, unconventional and very privileged background. Is the reality more nuanced? Is there anything that's misunderstood about your upbringing and what shaped you going forwards because of your family life? Sure. First, thank you, thank you for being here tonight. Thank you for having me. It's a great pleasure and honor to be at a very pleasure. at Oxford tonight. You mentioned yes I was very lucky obviously and I think one of the things that is very important with my upbringing is the values that were given to me you know values of family values of work values of merit nothing was granted everything was always earned whether it was through school through sports through music through achievements in a way which I think are foundational to everyone's education today including mine you know and I think that's what makes the beauty of the group as well the LVMH group is a family group and the first most important value is definitely family and you know any of you work for LVMH or have or want to work for LVMH that's sort of what you'll feel by joining the company is that yes it's a publicly traded company that's very big with a lot of employees but in the end it's a family that's represented by our family and and that was the biggest value that was transmitted to me which which which I hopefully will translate to my own children as well. That sort of upbringing of everything must be earned and the sort of certain expectations, did you feel like there was pressure put on you to sort of follow in your father's footsteps or indeed your mother's footsteps in either the corporate or musical worlds? So there's never official pressure, you know, when it's always like, oh, you can do whatever you want, of course, but when the moment comes, I guess you feel the pressure. One of the things that I like to say is that I feel like I've been an MBA since I'm born, you know, because every lunch or dinner conversation is probably about the business and it's a great chance because obviously I learned a lot and the group was made, you know, since the 80s. I was born in 92 so I kind of could have seen it through its inception and its creation, which is a huge advantage to understand the market better. So, you know, there is pressure of course, but it's also only if, I mean, I'm not, I mean, meet the expectations. So it's, it's, uh, that's how it's measured. Do you think having that family connection with the company has changed how you've worked and how you view your job in the various parts of LVMH that you've worked in? Of course. So being younger than most executives, you know, I think this MBA since I'm born that I've been talking about is definitely something that gave me competitive advantage to understand the luxury market, the luxury market, the luxury industry from a very young age. So that's, you know, I wouldn't have that would not have had that, had I not been a part of the family, which is great. And I think then also, you know, people are very respectful of the family and of what we do to the group. So I think two things. One, meritocracy is key. So, you know, nothing is taken for granted. For example, you know, when I started running Remoa, it was kind of a coincidence to be fair. I found the company, I started to lead the acquisition process and I wasn't at all going to work there and the former owner and CEO said, you know, I'll only sell the company if you become co-CEO next to me. So then, you know, I was 23 years old, 24 years old. I said, okay, wow, I have to move to Germany. I had not planned this at all. It kind of came this way, you know. So meritocracy is very important within the group. So, you know, you'll never see us when I say us as my siblings and myself kind of like jump from a position to another. with no earned and then nothing earned I mean and then two I think what's also super important as as being part of the family is respect we're you know a very respectful organization of people's careers people's developments and and that was definitely taught to me from from a very young age you said that LVMH is a very sort of family-oriented company and Ramoa who you as you said mentioned you were co-ceeo of was also a family business before LVMH acquired it. The number of family businesses have been going down over the years and now only 10% of family businesses make it to third generation. Do you think there is something inherently beneficial in a company being a family business? I mean, yes. Of course, I think it's extremely beneficial for a few things. You know, I was mentioning to one of your colleagues today that I was with a few private equity folks right before coming here who have a very different vision of how they view business. right they they you know private equity is a great industry I was working in there before but they acquire businesses with the mindset of turning them around quickly and selling them what we do as a family company and what I've seen in most family companies like Ramoa for example is very long-term thinking and we always like to say that we never think of what we do for the next quarter for the next year for the next five years but for the next 50 years you know and every decision we make some of them you know I I think we're going to talk about later are not necessarily or often never financially driven, but they're always driven towards desirability of the brand. So I was hearing you talk about Beyonce and Jay-Z earlier before I came in. You know, we made that decision at the very beginning of Tiffany when the world was always still locked down and we weren't seeing the end of it, but you know we thought, hey, why not try and do this, which will hopefully drive desirability for the next 10, 15, 20 years for the brand which it's easy to say now it was successful right but back then you know it's it's sort of things that you can do in a family business that you can't do in a publicly traded company that's not controlled that has to deliver quarterly earnings or you know things like that so i think for that family businesses are very valuable and then being a part of a family is also very important for for people who work for us you know i think there's a hundred 60 000 people working at lvmh today which is big but you know they they feel feel as part of the family can move from a brand to another and it's it's you can't find that in other places in my view what do you attribute the decrease the number of family businesses to in sort of global business world it's tough i don't know i think you've seen a lot of examples of families that have fought families that haven't understood how to work with each other and i think it all comes from the founder and then how it's all done in the next generations to make sure that everybody gets along, everybody has a clear set of responsibilities and, you know, what I was mentioning to you, like meritocracy and earning your way in and proving yourself or sometimes working outside is very important to kind of start learning and make sure that all the decisions you make are for the business first and for yourself. I think that's the few examples I can think of of family businesses that weren't successful, didn't follow these rules. Going back to yourself, you said you had this sort of MBA since birth, style of upbringing and education and yet you went on to do a degree in science, computer science. What was the motivating factor behind that if you'd sort of already clocked in your head that you wanted to go into business? So a few things. Number one I think in France, every country has its different perspective on studies in France. Engineering is often perceived as the most prestigious studies you could do and I don't know if some of you are familiar with the French school system, but it's all anonymous. Like when you do what you call a class preparatory you go there and you're with whatever 10,000 people and your name doesn't matter, everything's blanked out. So whatever success you have is really up to what you've done, what you've learned and what you've studied. So it was very important to me coming from the family that I have with my last name to do something that I could do on my own, right? That I couldn't buy, that nobody could pay for that that was just fully linked to my studies, my work, my rigor and I think that's one of the reasons why I did that for sure. Then also I thought that, you know, I was always interested in math and like science, so it was definitely something that I was interested studying and the business studies per se I didn't feel like could give me as much as science because as I told you I was I was shown to business very early on. So linking that in with some of the decisions you've since made in businesses. Tiffany's marketing since you took over as the EVP has been full of very bold statements with like a yellow store, crypto punks, TIF coins and then the some of the campaigns that you've launched. Has this partly been driven by your scientific education or is it instead, as you said, driven by this desire to make the brand continually desirable in 10, 20, 50 years time? A bit of both, you know, I mean obviously crypto isn't necessarily something that's embraced by a lot of executives in luxury today. So I was lucky to be shown to that world very early and very interested. So that's why we started doing little things in that space. I think the science upbringing gave me more kind of the rigor and the way of working more than like the inspiration to do these things. So it was definitely more desirability driven for sure. and kind of like when we bought the company which is a year and a half ago already you know we did an assessment pretty quickly of its strength its weaknesses like you know you've learned this many times and marketing was kind of the easy pillar the first easy pillar that you could actionate because in these businesses I always say there's three levers that you can work on which is one the stores to the products and three the marketing you know there's 350 stores at Tiffany, so renovating everything or changing everything takes five years. You know, it's very capital intensive, labor intensive. Product, it's not like fashion, fashion you bring in a designer, there's a new collection and things change. Jewelry, you know, you need to buy stones and make molds and buy gold and it takes minimum two years to really launch something. So marketing was the first thing that we could do. And we really saw that the brand was so powerful. At Ramoa in the US, when I joined the company, the awareness, so if you take 100 people and you put them in the room and you ask them, do you know Ramoa, two of them would say yes, 98 would say no. When I left, five people would say yes, 95 would say no. So people were like, wow, it grew so fast and everything. At Tiffany, if you take 100 people in the room, 99.5% of these people know the brand, you know, so it's a very, very different scale. And it's so strong in people's minds that you could actionate marketing really easily in a way to rejuvenate it and to take risks that had never been taken before. As well as those bold statements that I mentioned, you've also been known for the culture-led collaborations, including the Jay-Z and Beyonce, one I mentioned, but also under the Supreme and off-white, protect Philippe. Do you, some of these have been quite controversial, including your not-your-mother-mother-Mudders-Tiffany campaign. Does all of this link back to a belief that all publicity is good publicity? So I don't say, I don't think all publicity is good publicity. You know, there's, especially today with social networks, it's very difficult to have an authentic and organic message to share and you see a lot of things that are not successful at all. People get criticized and a lot of bashing and everything that can really ruin brands, right? So we're very cautious with what we do. mentioning not your mother's Tiffany. I was looking into the numbers two days ago actually and then our silver business grew the fastest in five years the month of that campaign so it was probably controversial but you know it had a great impact on sales which is which is in the end what we look for. So with those collaborations what's important to us and obviously you see a lot of brands that are doing collaboration after collaboration which are good or bad you don't know but we're really trying to be as authentic as we can and you know I'll just take one example which is supreme. A lot of brands now say, oh, we have to target millennials and they make these matrices, matrices of saying, hey, what are the brands that talk to millennials? They have a list and they say, okay, we're going to do Supreme to tick a box of millennials. And those recipes can work really well. That's just not what we do. We actually took a call from Supreme and then they called us at Ramo and said, okay, they've never done bags before, they talked to a street skate culture that we like, let's do something that's super authentic with them and then it ends up targeting millennials. but it's never done kind of in a marketing way, but more in a very authentic and organic way, which leads to selling out and hopefully success. So with both of those moves, the Not Your Mother campaign and targeting brands like Supreme, we're not targeting, but working with brands like Supreme. Some critics have argued that you are targeting this sort of new base of customers and in turn sacrificing some of your loyal long-term or older customers. Do you think that this is a fair criticism? And do you think it is a sort of approach that all luxury brands need to take at some stage to risk themselves becoming outdated? So I don't think it's fair for a few reasons. One, the supreme collaboration that we did was probably the time where I had the most surprising people call me to get a suitcase. You know, they were old and, and not at all working in design, luxury or anything. So it shows that even with these kinds of products, you can reach people that are not necessarily the average skateboarder with its hoodie or something that you're looking for. Obviously, we're never gonna try to alienate anyone from our customer base, which is why we're trying to do things at different scales. And if I take Ramoah or Tiffany, we're working with contemporary artists or Supreme. We're working with very known brands like or you know Virgilablo or things like that so we really try to do everything we can that being said I think I always forget the number we think it's 64% of the world is below 40 in age right so they all their consumption is ahead of them and 92% of these people are connected somehow to the internet so it's it's definitely these people that are the future of what we're doing so in my view it's not alienating yourselves the old customers to the new customers I'm taking a few shortcuts to what your question was, but it's more about how to be relevant with this consumer base, who's not necessarily your target consumer base now, so that when they become the target consumer base, they think of you and not of other brands, right? And by doing that still talking to the customers that are existing today. And one of the things behind Not Your Mother's Tiffany campaign is also that, hey, a lot of mothers want to look like their daughters too, right? So if they want to be cool like their daughters or things like that, so by targeting younger people you also get to their parents. Do you think it's a frequent and long-term problem that luxury brands have is that they tend to be associated with wealthier and older people and that over time that can sort of lead to them dying out and fading into relevance? For sure, for sure. I think, you know, one thing that you're mentioning is wealth. Obviously, I always like to say I don't like the word luxury because it's too linked to price and you know you go to Tiffany, you can spend and 180 pounds and you can get something great made by hand in the US when a great packaging that gets you into the brand you know you can argue 180 pounds is a lot of money for sure but you know not close to the 5,000 dollars you would find it at other brands as a starting price so I don't think price is an issue to me or a bottle of moat champagne for 30 euros what is a brand we own too that's a product that's made with great craft with you know amazing attention to detail and it's a luxury product in my end. So I do think that it is linked to what you're saying. However, as long as you maintain relevance and you're able to stay culturally relevant to today's world, I don't see the brands extinguishing any time. Do you think that the, as I was an interesting point with Tiffany there, about the lower end items that you sell going on. They're not low end. Not low end, sorry, low price. like low price end, going all the way up to sort of tens, hundreds of thousands of pounds, pieces of diamond jewelry. Do you think that by having such a large price spectrum, you debase the luxuriness of the top price end products? I think so because we try to be super accessible. You know, we want to be a place where everybody can get in the store and find something for themselves. I like to say you can go in and spend 200, 2,000, 20,000, 200,000, 200,000. thousand two million, twenty million. Name one brand where you have such an array of spend. There's not that many that I can think of, you know. And so a lot of people tell me the stories, so it's now under construction, but that when they visit New York, the first stop they make is the Tiffany store on 57 and fifth of Audrey Hepburn. And one of the key things, the key attributes of the brand is its accessibility. A lot of luxury stores can feel very scary or very obnoxious, you know, hopefully in our group we try not to do that, but I've definitely felt like this before. And at Tiffany, we try to do the exact opposite. Everyone's welcome, whether they're spending 200 to 20 million pounds. And that's one of the greatest characteristics of the brand. So yeah, it's really what we're trying to build. Focusing back on you, obviously going from being a co-CEOOO, which is a multi-100 million pound company, to being EVP at Tiffany, a much bigger company, would have been a bit of a shift. How did your experience as President Romoa prepare you for the challenge of working in Tiffany? Two different businesses, you know, from suitcases to diamonds, so it has nothing to do with each other. But I think being CEO of Remova for, I think it was four years, taught me a few things. One is entrepreneurship, taking decisions and being accountable for the decisions you make. you know, I was discussing with someone right before. I worked with McKinsey, you know, as a consultant, and it was great experience, but I was helping people make decisions. I was not making the decisions myself. Making decisions per se is definitely something that was extremely insightful and, you know, where kind of you're on the line. Like, whatever you do, you're responsible, you're accountable, and at Tiffany is the same thing, you know, whether it's deciding to press play on not your mother's Tiffany or Beyonce or whatever crypto punks were doing, those things then are out in the world and you're accountable for them. So I think the decision-making process was definitely something that the first thing that Ramo learned taught me, building a team also is the first thing I did when I was at Romo is like how to build a world-class executive team to help me in different areas. Tiffany, same thing, you know, we went out to build a completely revamped team of talents that we believed could help us take the brand to where it was supposed to go. And then three is long-term. You know, again, back to this family thing, you know, Ramo and Tiffany were two different companies. Ramo was a family business, so it was already operating on a super long-term vision. So when I came, I kind of perpetrated this tradition. Tiffany was a uncontrolled publicly traded company that was taking decision on quarterly basis, you know, for the stock price. And so we, you know, the CEO myself really tried to stop those decision-making processes to make them much more long-term, even if that meant much more investment. Year 1, year, 2, year 3, which, you know, will kind of not be great for profits in the first year, but in the end will be super beneficial to the brand and the customers. That shift also saw you go from being co-CEO to EVP. Have you felt there's been a loss of your individual agency in order your ability to make decisions as part of that? No, no, not at all because... You know, there was 3,000 people at Remova, 15,000 at Tiffany, so it's a very different scale. And I'm very, you know, we, I view today work as being really teamwork, whether you're a CEO or EVP or whatever you do. You know, we have at Tiffany today, we have weekly meetings with the whole exact team. And if I want to launch a product and everybody says, we don't really believe in that product, you know, I'm not going to say, let's do it because I believe in it, right? It's all about kind of working together. And it was the same when I was CEO at Remo. You know, you can't just make decisions by yourself because there's just too many variables in the business that each and every person has their own expertise on. Looking at LVMH more generally, it's a massive international conglomerate with dozens of what I know you don't like to call them luxury brands, but people would sort of perceive them as luxury brands within it. Do you think that luxury brands are mainly purchased as status symbols rather than appreciations of craftsmanship? And what connotations think this has for the business model of LVMH companies? So I disagree with that statement. You know, obviously there's always the people that want to buy logos or whatever to flex, as you were saying, right? but I think what differentiates us to a lot of other brands is craftsmanship, quality, entrepreneurial spirit and investment level, right? Like if you walk into a Riton store, a Tiffany store, Dior store, you'll find products that were made by hand with exquisite materials that took, you know, weeks or years sometimes to design, to master and that, you know, you don't buy this just to show off. I think you buy this because you, it's, A, it's an investment. usually, you know, yes, there are some products that are priced lower, but most products are very expensive. So, you know, when you spend that amount of money, it's for something that, you know, will be durable, that you know you will like and enjoy, I believe, much more to show off. At least that's the kind of clients that we interact with, you know. Or sometimes, you know, we sell super expensive pieces of jewelry at Tiffany that people don't necessarily want to wear because they're too expensive, they're scared, but they like to look at them, put them in their house because they understand stones or medals and appreciate craftsmanship and sometimes necklaces take three years to make you know three years of work for three craftsmen that's all they do for three years you know so I mean that that has to have some appreciation within within the clients and I think that's definitely something that differentiates us to a lot of competitors really high-end products like those pieces of jewelry you just mentioning in the sort of old world, even 10 years ago, 20, 30 years ago, where luxury products were the sole domain of areas of limited real estate like Harrods and a limited pool of ultra wealthy people. It was very easy for LVMH and LVMH companies to control the market. Do you think that that has changed and the desirability of ultra high-end products has changed with the eruption of e-commerce, of social media and with the increased rapidly changing trends that we see. I think so. I think today access is much easier, whether it's first hand products, second hand products, you know, even now like drops that will sell out from any brand you can find on resale marketplaces. So access is much easier thanks to the internet, thanks to social media. I do believe that physical retail remains very important. You know, we just opened a new Dior store in Paris last month, which is probably the most extraordinary luxury store in the world we you know took three years to build it and invested a lot of money into it and it there's a lines in front of the store every day you know so you could think that e-commerce revolutionized shopping people still want to go in and be treated with white gloves and you know try on jackets and taste or a feel leather so I think a combination of both is where the world is going Amazon definitely made shopping super easy you know two clicks it's great, but shopping on a weekend and strolling down Fifth Avenue or Avenue Montaine on a Saturday on a great day is an experience you can't really replace online. So we're really investing heavily into both areas to make sure that we can be wherever our clients want us to be. And for us, luxury is exactly this, you know, giving our clients what they want. How do you think LVMH can retain its current level of relevance in the coming decades? That's a question to ask to 160,000 people. You know, it's, I think continuing to be at the forefront of creativity, of innovation, and craftsmanship is exactly how we can stay relevant. And we're trying to do, we're trying to do so, always hiring the most cutting-edge designers, opening in the most fashion-forward places, buying brands that are on the market that are, you know, very desirable. and building upon that is for us how we think we can stay relevant. We don't have a recipe, right? It's year after year after year of creative processes across different industries, but this is definitely what we're trying to do. You've worked at Tiffany for about a year now, and you're clearly really enjoying it and getting your sort of teeth into various projects. Are there any LVMH companies that you really look at and think I want to work there someday? I'm focused on Tiffany right now. Yeah. There's a lot of work. There's a lot of work to do. You know, it's, yeah, it's, we, I try not to look ahead too much and really focus on what I'm doing. Same in my previous job at Remo. I was really like trying to make sure that I'm building the most desirable brand in what I'm doing. And then opportunities come for sure. Again, a bit less of a sort of serious question, but do you find yourselves mainly wearing, eating, drinking, LVMH brands? Yes, though not today, you know, I think those are not LVMH shoes, but I tend to do so for sure. Do you have a favourite? Tiffany? I don't know. I should have expected that one. I suppose looking more at the brand, the conglomerate nature of it, do you think that having multinational conglomerations of dozens and dozens of brands is healthy for the business world? So for us and for luxury, I do think it is very healthy for a few reasons. One, there's a lot of synergies that can be built between different brands, which you couldn't have if you were an independent. I think a lot of independent brands now struggle because of the space that we are carrying or Richemont, the kind of three large luxury conglomerates take. And so for smaller brands to develop themselves, it's way quicker and easier to do so. So within a conglomerate, you know, if I look at Remoa also, for example, without LVMH, I don't know how the company would have weathered through COVID. You know, like nobody was traveling or buying a suitcase for two years. So, you know, we kept every single employee, we didn't give any paid down grades, we paid everyone every month, and that's because of the power of a group like LVMH that we could do so and take losses. And now, you know, all the competitors were discounting their price. products, closing stores, not paying their partners or suppliers, we didn't do any of that and now we're ready. Now that travel is picking up again, it's booming again. So having a group like LVMH and conglomerate helped us to do so. Then I also think that for creativity it's amazing because having a conglomerate like this allows people to, like I said, go from a brand to another, but also across different industries. So we often have people that go from wines and spirits to fashion or to jewelry to perfumes and that applies creative minds and creative brains to total different industries and problems which in my view are beneficial to the industry as a whole because you know you're applying what you learned in different areas to something new that needs this level of creativity to to grow um sorry she has water um a question i suppose then about the consequences of having such a large uh of an agglomerate. Obviously your father is a very wealthy man and lots of his contemporaries in the world of very wealthy men are well known for what they do with their money, be it by other large companies or go to space or whatever else. Do you believe that... I want to go to space, yes. Do you believe that people with individuals, that level of wealth have certain responsibilities to the global community? And do you think it is irresponsible to use that wealth in the manner that some of some individuals do? Sure. Not your father. He hasn't been to space that I know of. So it's not my place to talk about what people do with their money, obviously. But when it comes to my family, one thing that's important to us is you see a lot of numbers in Forbes and all these places and a lot of people think that it's a big bag of cash under a bed somewhere. The truth is all of this is invested into the business, right? It's all into shares that we've never sold, that we'll never share, and it will never sell. And it's invested into growing the business, hiring more people, opening plants, investing into countries. You know, I think we hire 10 or 15,000 people every two or three years. we open plants around the world, we acquire companies, we do a lot of things with this. So obviously we have a big responsibility which we're trying to live with and do things with that. But the money is invested into the company and not planning to be used to go to space or do any other things. I'm just to ask one more question before we hand over to questions from our audience. But you are in a room supposedly of future world leaders in various fields. at least that's what the Oxford Union tries to sell itself on. In a world in which leaders of politics, in business, in finance, are becoming older and older, what advice do you have for young people trying to enter into the world of business and finance, as you did at quite a young age? Yeah. I think be curious. For me, curiosity is one of the most important virtues one can have and being interested. in a lot of different areas of life from business to science to whatever. Two, and that's not common is be street smart. I think one of the things I value the most in people when I hire them is the street smartness and I learned that from being at Remoa, you know, joining a company that was already super big in sales but that had basically zero infrastructure, you know, where you hire 40-year-olds that are doing things that they were doing when they were 22 and that allows you to be super polyvalent, as you say in French, I don't know the word in English, but work in different areas and be very flexible. And then I think, you know, what's also super important is to do what you love. You know, it's a very boring thing, but I think not be forced to follow a path because it's a path that people set for you, but I always feel like people are much better in what they do when you can feel that they love what they do. And, you know, At Remova, I always like to tell people, if you don't like traveling, don't join the company because we're selling suitcases. And I want you to want to travel on the weekends so you can give me feedback. And same for Tiffany. Like you have to like jewelry, whether you know you're a middle-aged man or a young woman getting married and who wants a diamond ring or whatever it is. You know, I think it's the love for the product is what's the most important to us. Thanks very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. enough of my questions. So if any of you have any questions for Alexander, please put your hands up. The member in the front row to my right. Thank you. And thank you very much for that interview. It was really interesting. Oh wait, stand up. Okay. Thank you. I was wondering, I thought it was really interesting what you said about kind of reaching out to future generations and remaining pertinent to kind of new customer bases and people who are interested in upcoming trends and so on. Some of what your work is involved around, for example, your NFT launches, for example, the TIF coin, that also has pertinent to some of the things we're organizing at the Oxford Union. We're doing like a debate on the Metaverse in a couple of weeks and so on too. I was just wondering how do, like as you know quite a young, relatively young CEO, how do you kind of balance that contemporary energy and that kind of eye to innovation with retaining the traditions which Tiffany and LVMH more generally holds? And sort of stemming from that, what kind of trends and so on would you recommend people who, young people like us who are interested in kind of the fashion and art industry to keep in mind going forwards? But yeah, thank you. Sure. So first part, you know, keeping a balance between tradition and modernity is the essence of what we're trying to do. You know, and it's always the balance of super, like, you know, super traditional trunk making ad vitons linked to Nike sneakers made by Virgil that are very futuristic. You know, it's all about balancing everything that we're trying to do the best we can, you know, so far it's working, so we're very lucky and fortunate for that, but that's definitely been kind of the essence of what all of our brands do. As for a new trends, you know, not going to say the Metaverse because everybody's bored by that already and I think there's a lot of misconceptions and easy things that are said in there but I do think that new communities are trends that are extremely exciting for fashion art and other areas because you know for us we come from a world where 30 years ago the only way you could give your message to people was by taking the back page of Vogue magazine and you would tell like hey this is my brand, this is who I am and you don't have a say to it. Now with Instagram, Twitter and TikTok and everything, like you can still give this message but people can comment, tweet, reshare, talk about it, trash, love and build communities around this, right? And so getting access to these communities and understanding how they work is very important in my view to grow businesses organically in a way that's community-led versus super authoritarian like it was in the past. And I don't think it's contrarian to building a brand in a kind of like very cold mindset, but it's important to be a part of this. And so I think it applies to art, NFTs, Metaverse, a lot of categories. Thank you very much. That's a big help. Thank you. Now move to the next question. The honor member in the floral dress on the front of my. Thank you very much for sharing your insights with us. The focus of my DFIL research is on loyalty and what drives really truly loyal behavior. Now a lot of luxury brands focus very much on transactional loyalty. I'd like to ask you, since arriving at Tiffany, you mentioned that you sort of brought a new long-term vision to the company. company. Have you brought in sort of a new vision of loyalty and a new approach to loyalty? And can you share that with us? Sure. So it's a very interesting question. And loyalty is obviously the most important, or one of the most important metrics that we track in our businesses, right? It's repeat business, as we call it in a very transactional way, as you're saying. It's early to talk about new ways of loyalty. However, I do think that the arrival of social media, and cell phones basically allowed customers to have a much more privileged relationship to brands. Because in a former world you could live in a place where there's no store in the three hours around from you and you would have to literally drive to the store to get access to something. Now you can talk to sales representative on WhatsApp or whatever you want and you're able in that way to create a relationship between you and the brand that is completely personalized to who you are. And you know you will wish you happy birthday and we'll know kind of what you're looking for because of what you've spent in the past or if you're whatever, getting married, having children or God knows what part of your life you're at. And then we're able to talk and target you and target you in a way that's much more personalized, which is also not driven by Salesforce or like CRM kind of software, but is human driven, right? And so all about relationships. And I feel like this has been a big part of what we've been trying to drive in, in consumption at Tiffany or in other brands of the group, which has had a lot of success. Because then if you feel emotionally connected to the company and you actually have someone to talk to, you know, you can, you know something's coming out, you ask for it in advance and things like that, and it drives a lot more repeat business, loyalty and excitement between you and the brand for sure. Thank you very much. If my sister's carefully curated display of light blue boxes is anything to go by. I think Tiffany's doing quite a good job of loyalty. The other member in the front row, yeah. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to us today. What are your key priorities for Tiffany going forward? And if we think in five years time, what excites you the most about the brand? And if you think about what Tiffany can bring to the broader watchers and jewelry division at LVMH, what would you highlight there? and similarly what learnings can you take from the other brands of the group maybe the acquisition of bulgarie thank you so five years from now it's a long time we're our priorities are to grow the business in a very organic way and desirable way you know Tiffany is one of the most well-known brands in the world in the US especially we know that and we're trying to make it regain desirability that it had in the past that it could have lost a little bit and you know little by little all initiatives you're seeing us do since a year and a half now has been to go through this path. So it's really desirability first then I think product is very important to us. You know we have four product categories basically you know I'm not going to bore you with details but it's silver jewelry, gold jewelry, engagement jewelry and high jewelry, you know and so all areas have different priorities per se and are growing themselves in a way that we want to make sure that craftsmanship and quality is maintained and even higher going forward regardless of category whether it's a 180 dollar trinket or a 200,000 necklace so regardless of price point and category when it comes to engagement jewelry it's also very interesting right because it's a it's a more macro business unit right like the less weddings the less people are going to by wedding rings. So the world people are getting married less and less other than this year because there were two years without weddings but like the trends are decreasing so it's more of a market share gain than a pure kind of product innovation because a diamond ring is is a diamond ring you know in the end. So then new categories also is very important to us you know we used to be the reference for tableware for accessories for example which we still do but in a way that it's not as successful as it used to be so we're in the plan of relaunching that in the next few months watches also you know a lot of people talk about the patek philippe watches that we sell which are great but they're they're not tiffany made you know they're made in the protect fleet watch factories so we're definitely super interested in that category too what can it bring to the watch and jewelry division of lvmh well it's the largest brand now so whatever it brings you know it shows quickly because it's it's the largest acquisition in luxury and It's the largest brand by far in the division of the group. So learnings, buying power, synergies are very important of what we can bring in that end. You know, when it comes to buying diamonds or things like that. Bulgary is another interesting story. What it taught us was that, you know, we didn't know a lot about the jewelry business before because we were very fashion driven and Bulgary taught us to be patient, which is one of the few things I am not. And like I said earlier, you know, designers come into a fashion brand. Three months later you have a new collection and things can just shift like this. Drewie takes a lot more time. So it taught us to be patient and I think, you know, we were able to make decisions like these which were not too rushed, which we could have done a little bit in the beginning at Vulgarie because we didn't know the industry as well. Just to maintain kind of growth also and not take too drastic decisions that could have been not the right ones to make. for example, you know, discontinuing product lines. I heard a lot of people say when we bought the company, like, oh, they're going to stop silver because it's not expensive. And it's not at all what we're planning to do whatsoever, which we can do now by understanding patients. Thank you. Thank you very much. The member of the second here. You mentioned class prepan, that kind of thing. I was just wondering where Oxford, if you'd give us an insight into what student life was like at the Ecolopoli Technique and if you think it resembles kind of British student life, Oxford or American student life, etc. So I've just spent one hour in Oxford in my whole life, which is this hour. So no, what I can tell you about class prep for sure is from 18 to 20 years old, basically when you graduate high school, you go to these very generalist science, classes which are you know math, physics, chemistry, a little bit of English and like literature that we do and and it's a competition with an age group of people that go against you and the first so after these two years of intense studying and when I say intense it's very very intense the first 15 get into the best school the next 15 get into the best school etc etc all in a super anonymous way as I I mentioned earlier, unlike Oxford where I feel like when you come here and correct me if I'm wrong, but you can kind of choose what you want to study. Class Prepar, you can choose if you want to do scientific or business focused, but then you're kind of all in the same boat and shaken, shaken, shaken, shaken in the same boat and you can only specialize much later. So I started studying computer science when I was 22. Until I was 22, I was just doing math, physics, chemistry, like all my other classmates at this, we're learning the same things. It's academically very difficult, you know, I hated my parents for letting me do that, but now I'm very grateful because it teaches you a lot of things like hard work and effort and that you can't learn anywhere else at that age, to be honest, especially you know, like me coming from a very privileged background, like the only thing that talks in the end is your result of the exam. So was it fun? Was student life fun eventually once like the academics? It wasn't super fun. No, no. And the thing is also like it's the one broken thing of the French system, you know, I don't know how to unbreak it is that like you have these two or three years, two years for the most smart, three for the less smart. I did three of class prepers that are very, very intense. And then once you get into the school after this competition, you know, you get your results, whatever. Like in July you have the best summer of your life. the school is kind of laid back. You know, you don't like, I remember when I arrived, I came from a world where I would go to school from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and then study till midnight every day for three years to having a day and a half of classes and the rest of the time just like, just do whatever, you know. So I was, I started working immediately because I was bored, you know, but it's kind of a big disconnect between what you do once you're inside the school. That's the prestigious thing to do versus when you're in the class prepers. So I really think the class prep is the real training program that you can get. I look to remember the back in the Hawaiian shirt. Thank you for being here. I'm curious about your experience going through this transaction and then now leading the company with the background of COVID, now what are very much so unprecedented issues of supply chains, globalization, all sorts of other, you know, war ongoing right now, things that really haven't happened in your lifetime, and then also just are quite circumstantially different from the past and kind of what experiences you've had in your working crew up to this point, and then also that helped you through that, and then also what you've kind of learned from the last two and a half years in that environment. Sure, so super disturbed times. You know, when I joined Tiffany in January of last year, for the first three months, there was no offices. I didn't meet a single person face by face and I had to assess who was doing a good job, not a good job, who was doing what, all over Zoom, which people think that young people love Zoom, I hate Zoom. It was extremely, extremely difficult to understand and make right decisions. decisions like these and review products and designs and campaigns all behind the screen. So that's the first very like pragmatic impact that it had on the acquisition from joining the company. Then the US was closed to the world for the first 12 months when I was there so you know nobody could come either talents or anything you wanted to do. You know, you couldn't get out of the country or in the country because of the border closures which was a huge difficulty to run the business in a good way. Then, you know, obviously supply chain is a huge issue for everyone. So, you know, I could go on and on about shipments of diamonds and gold and materials that are not getting in time or things like that, but I think everybody's facing that. So it's less proper to what we did at Tiffany. I think the fact that the acquisition happened right in the middle of COVID, is definitely something that was the most disrupting to running the business for sure. Then, you know, I think it's the street smartness that I was talking about earlier is what allows the company and us to make decisions that can help you grow and go quicker in on certain environments, in environments where, you know, you haven't never experienced it before. Hopefully you'll never experience them. And again, you were asking for the last two and a half years. I remember in March of 2020, I was CEO of Remoah. And we were talking about COVID a little bit. And then the border is closed from a day to another. And we were selling suitcases. So we're like, okay, what's going to happen? Like we have 2,300 factory workers. We're building thousands of suitcases a year, a day. Like, what's going to happen to demand? Are we supposed to close the factories, let go of people? And it's very, very day by day. and then all that with lockdowns and things where you don't expect your business to be run this way ever. But, you know, it's just day by day you take it and you try to make the right decisions that you can for the business. I have time for probably one or two more questions. The member in the black jumper in the second row on my right. Hi, how do you think the part of the part? popularity of fast fashion and increasingly short trend cycles and younger demographics impacts companies like Tiffany who focus on the quality of their craft over the speed of production. It's a great question. You know, I think, and again, I'm not going to talk about fast fashion or competitors, I do think that it's a completely different business model that we have. You know, we don't view ourselves at all as fast cycles, fast, fast cycle companies, even if our fashion brands, you know, do six, eight collections a year sometimes. Everything is done with the utmost creativity. We never copy anyone, you know, which I think a lot of fast fashion companies tend to do just for the sake of being fast. And I think, you know, as long as we stay creative, we stay at the heart of what we do best, hopefully we'll stay successful. So we really don't really look at this industry too much because it's just a different business. It's just like if you were asking me what I thought of food delivery, it's a great business, right, but like it doesn't have a lot to do with what we do, given the business model, even if, you know, we share a lot of customers. A lot of customers shop at Tiffany and also shop at fast fashion companies or, you know, get food delivered in their houses. So it's an ecosystem of people that we share, but we don't work the same way at all. Thank you. Next question, please. The member in the red coat in the front right here. I said the member in the red coat. Sorry. You can go next, sir. Very disciplined. Hi, thank you so much for coming. It's been such an interesting talk and everything. Thank you. You mentioned earlier the Patech and introduce watch and obviously LVMH has been behind some incredibly high demand products like the Diora Air Jordan or the Supreme Ramoa suitcases. suitcases that have all like that are all like reselling at inflated prices and I was just wondering what your thoughts were on this like massive inflation on the resale market and the resale market more generally and what LVMH's approaches in that regard especially as like one of the criticism that it can be is that it takes away you know the opportunity like from loyal customers to shop and yeah thank you yeah so a few things I think the inflation on the resale market for us is a matter of supply and demand you know you have this in every industry whether it's you know a company going public and the stock soaring on the first day because supply and demand are not equal we try not to look at it too much even if a lot of people are excited about it when so the resale market is very new it's like whatever five seven years old before that it was much easier now the first few collaborations we made it was difficult to understand how we could allocate pieces to people, right? Because you want to please your loyal customers, you want to give a chance to everyone also to become a new customer and not having to be a customer for eight years to get access to this product. So it took a little bit of learning. I think every brand does it differently, but the way I view it is kind of a combination of both. You know, whenever you know that you're doing a limited quantity product that you feel is going to be successful, A, it's not always successful, but when it is and the resell value skyrockets, We try to sell it to a combination of people who are loyal customers and new customers to make sure that we can be fair and equitable to everyone. That being said, products like the Patek Philippe, for example, are completely disproportionate because you can buy it for I think $50,000 or $60,000 and it's sold for $6 million. So that's like a real, real money present you can make to someone. So we're trying to also find people who we know actually want the product. and not want the asset, if it makes sense, because they consider this as an asset, right, and we sell products in craftsmanship and quality. We don't sell options or derivatives or things like that, right? So we really try to make sure that every client we pick to buy those products, whether they're loyal or new, we give them like an interview or a vetting or a background check of some sort to make sure that, you know, it's going into the right hands. We make mistakes all the time. You know, you'll see these products on a resale website. at auction all the time, but we try to do it the least we can. Great, thank you so much. Very quickly then the gentleman in the blue jacket. Last question, I'm afraid. Sorry. Hi, Arcelain Karim, co-founder of Cleonova. I did check with my friend for his question. I think I have a better one, so I thought I'll stick to mine. which brand that you presently don't own would you really like to acquire and what is it in those brands that you think would make it a good fit for LVMH? Yeah I can't really answer that question I'm sorry because you know public markets and and Twitter maybe the second part or Tesla you know it depends maybe the second part question what do you look for in the in a brand that really gives it an LVMH stamp something yeah sure I think you know what we look at is the core values of of the company which is the ones that we shared in the beginning quality craftsmanship and strong DNA you know we we don't want to buy acquire gimmicky brands we acquire brands that have been you know here for a long time that are proven that have proven to be successful at some point in time. It doesn't have to be the hottest brand of the moment, but brands that we believe we can also continue to grow along the lines of extraordinary product in terms of quality, craftsmanship with a very strong DNA. I think more and more also we look at now that we're so large, we look at barriers to entry to make sure that we're not buying another fashion brand that's going to compete with all the other fashion brands we have, but we would acquire a fashion brand that had strong barriers to entry compared to the others that has a different value proposition for customers as well. Yeah, I think those are the key things that we look at. And then obviously, financial performance is important for us also, but that really comes at the end. Thanks. I did follow your work at Remover and I did buy a suitcase. I think you did a great job. Great. Buy another one. I've actually since you left, I'm switching to Globetrotter, so something's not working there right now. You're switching to Globetrotter? Yeah. Why? I think they have better innovation, better design and better product. Well, if it breaks, you know, don't call me. But before we finish two quick questions from me, one that we ask all our speakers and one that I'm just personally curious about. We'll start with the latter, diamonds. as someone obviously works at Tiffany, you must work lots of diamonds. Do you have a preference between natural diamonds and synthetic diamonds? And which would you choose and why? That's a great question, which I'm surprised no one has asked for now because it's very, very in the moment. So we don't sell lab-grown diamonds at Tiffany. We have a very clear view, and I share this view, that we believe strongly in natural diamonds for a few reasons. One, it's a part of history. You know, they take millions, thousands of years to be created inside of Earth, and it's a beautiful stone and product that has hours of craftsmanship also once it's found, you know. And two, I think the story also of the diamond, you know, you can buy a diamond for yourself or for someone you want to give it to, you know, and would you rather own something that has been a part of the planet forever, almost forever, or that has been done in a microwave someone? you know I can't answer that for you I know the answer for myself then I think a couple of things also that are to note number one is that diamond industry is very present in Africa if the lab grown diamond industry would take over the natural diamond industry I think you put 13 or 14 million people out of work in Africa and that could create extraordinary unrest that I don't see why you should create it and then two I think one of the things that's super important diamonds is ethical diamonds, you know. And at Tiffany, we proud ourselves to say that since 30 or 35 years since we can, every single diamond is sourced in the most ethical way. And when we sell you a diamond, we'll know where it was found, who found it, how much that person was paid, who they were working for, where it was cut, et cetera, et cetera, because we really value ethical sourcing and I think we'll journey towards the diamond from end to end. So, you know, once you have those criteria that are met, which we're proud of ourselves to meet, I think natural diamonds are the way to go, for sure. And finally, a question we ask all of our speakers. In two or three sentences, what advice would you give to the members of the Oxford Union and the members of Oxford University more generally going forwards in life? In general, in life. Yes, two of sentences, in life, anything, any advice. Kind of what I said earlier, you know, be curious, listen to what you love more than to what people tell you, even if, you know, what you studied is what you're studying. I studied engineering, and ended up, you know, working in diamond industry or jewelry industry, which has nothing to do with each other. So I would encourage you to do the same thing and have fun along the way also because I just turned 30 last week, you know, so my 20s are gone forever. and it happens. It comes by. My 20s haven't started yet. That makes you feel odd. Ladies General, thank you very much and join me. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
