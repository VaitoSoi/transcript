 Wow, this is a prestigious place. Thank you for the invitation. And we'll do the seek greetings. Weigurjee Ka'a, Waigurjii Faye. And good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for coming today. And especially inviting someone like me. Not long ago, about four decades ago, I was in a field in a small village in Punjab, harvesting crops hand by hand, no machinery. And now here we are, one of the most prestigious places in the world addressing you guys. What we're here today is talk about humanity. I'm not here to tell you how wonderful we are as a community. Just praise ourselves and then go back home. I'm a Sikh. I'm son of an immigrant. My father was a P.O.W in Singapore and as a Japanese. My people are a minority within India and globally. We are stateless people. From being stateless, our response to humanitarian disasters is faster than some states. Now, I think the best compliment we ever had was from our minister in Canada. He met me on one of my tours to Canada and he said, I don't understand, you're a small organization, yet you're on the first one to respond to disasters around the world, including in India. And that was a very good compliment, not to me. but to our amazing teams around the world and volunteers. Absolutely wonderful. Humanity is about all. As a Sikh, we are told in our prayers we pray twice a day for Srebatt Dapala, which means well-being of all. We don't differentiate. That is in every Sikh prayer, daily, minimum twice a day. We pray for the whole humankind, not just ourselves. We do face many challenges and we face some EU challenges. You know, after 9-11, what happened to the Sikhs, the identity crisis? So many were killed by racists. And then, when we work in places like Iraq helping the victims of ISIS, remember those victims were running away from people with tones and beards. That was the identity of the ISIS. And we're Sikhs, we got toes and beards. So the last eight years we played a very very important role in supporting those women that were captured by ISIS. What makes us do what we do? We Sikhs have also had genocides in our history. We are very young faith, youngest in the world probably. We already have three genocides. The most recent was in 1984, which nobody wants to talk about. My My opinions, my views as a humanitarian do annoy a lot of people. When you're a humanitarian, you've got to challenge human rights abuses for all. As a Sikh and as a minority, the discrimination we faced within India didn't make us hateful. The genocide didn't make us hateful. The continuous persecutions of my people didn't make us hateful because we believe our humanity eventually will win. You've got to remain humane. No matter what we face, hate can only be defeated, as you heard it, so many times, by love. And when I'm working in refugee camps, even here in the floods in the UK, I don't think people are looking at my faith. They're looking at another fellow human being come to help. So my community, although small, is extremely generous. We get so many questions. Who funds Carl Saeed? We've got chapters in India, Canada, America, Australia, all over the world. We're working all over the world in every emergency where we can, including new operations in Madagascar. My community continues to fund it. Although we suffered, we still see every human being as one, as humanity as one. I think in today's world, that is what's lacking. We don't want to challenge politicians, because it might offend someone. We don't want to challenge states because they will ban you, or they will put their trolls on you on social media, which we get all the time. As a humanitarian, one thing you have to always be true to yourself. You've got to speak up. speak up. You cannot be bought. So when I hear horrific stories, a powerful state has donated millions toward our humanitarian organization and that state continues to carry our human rights abuses and we accept it. There's something wrong. The war in Yemen, when I talk about it, you get pushed down. Our media hardly covers that war because we are supplying weapons to our friends, so-called friends. So humanitarian isn't just about dropping aid, it's talking about what goes on in that field, what goes on in that country, the human rights abuses, as I said, humanitarian. So that's what defines us. As a kid, I grew up in a very small village. I remember the fields burning in the heat, and there was no food because the whole harvest burned in the fields, it didn't rain. I was about nine or ten years old. And a village priest gathered the whole village, a tiny village middle of nowhere. This is when there's hardly any electric, there's nothing running, no running water. And he said to everyone, we're all going to pitching together until the next crop, and we're all going to eat together and help each other. Nobody's going to die. I also remember those words. But as a humanitarian running an organization that keeps growing and growing, somewhere you think about where are we going now. Have we come corporate? Are we losing our touch? But those little visions of my childhood, what we suffered, I remember the hunger in the village. Being an immigrant doesn't mean I'm going to sit there say, look, we're going to sit here and just complain about everything. We want to be part of the society. We want to build a society, but we don't want to forget those people that we left behind, which is people in our village, in our state, in our countries. Britain is probably one of the most generous countries in the world on charities. Extremely generous. But unfortunately, recently, somehow we're going in a different direction when it comes to humanity. We are treating people as commodities. We're treating people worse than, I think, animals at the moment when they come to our country. Migrants, I am a migrant, I am son of a migrant, I want to better my life, I want to better someone else's life in my family. So we must reflect how the world's changing. So as I said, what we suffered as a community has sikh has made us stronger, it's made us more human. The concept of Langer in the community, in the sea community, which is a free community kitchen, thousands of people across India every day and around the world and that's what we take into refugee camps nobody goes hungry where we're working so for a Sikh organization to be involved so heavily globally that for me shows that my community in all this time of darkness continues to shine as humanitarian today I can say the refugees on the Syrian rock border need 2 million pounds worth of food and I can guarantee you my community will raise that within minutes and that's what makes me proud as a Sikh we will we are known Sikhs are known if you look at both of World Wars World War I World War II our Sikh soldiers fought all over the world from Middle East Far East Asia Europe they were poisoned they died in the trenches died in the heat in the Middle East, in World War I, World War II, were very visible. We became like the UN. Our identity is automatic. We got the identity already, the turban, the beard. So we are fighting two on two fronts. One is to take on people like the organisations and groups with the ideologies like ISIS who got the turban and beard. And then we got our own demons. Can we do more? Can we do much more for the world? And each day and every day, you're seeing suffering. Just because the world's changed, doesn't mean we change. If you really want to make the change, you've got to resist this, what's going on. And the way to resist it is through your humanity. So it might be a Sikh, a human being first. My faith has helped me, amenely. It gave me the strength, but each faith does that. We got people who are atheists who volunteer with us. We got all sorts of faith that can volunteer with us. Because what I wanted to do as a CEO wasn't just sit on a high chair somewhere and dictate. I get my hands dirty. Every CEO in any charitable organisation should spend a few weeks on the ground getting their hands dirty. Unfortunately, most CEOs are bored from business sector because the turnover is so big. They never know what the person in the field is going through, what they need to do, how they struggle every day, what they face the challenges. We need to change that culture. We're here as part of you. If it's anything that we can do together, we will do it. If there's anything that we can do together, we will do it. Is it any way we can go and do a project together, we welcome that. I remember as a kid I wanted to volunteer for bigger organizations and all they kept selling me telling me was donate the money, donate the money, give us the money. I want it to be on the field. So we give you that choice. You want to see what we do, come with us. That's the difference in us and the bigger organizations. We want you to experience what it's like on the forefront. My son, he went on the first mission, he's 22. He went on the first mission this year in Madagascar. He's grown up here and everything and then he saw the reality. Really hit him hard. And for once he was questioning which were we going as human beings. We have so much here, not enough there. So the world is a very uneven, very unfair and mostly a very, very fastly changing place where And now we got people leaving the country, the lack of water, environmental changes, and somehow we have to change with that. So we are growing with your sport, but we still got to keep in touch who we are. Our humanity must always come first. My biggest fear is when people make large donations to us, like J.K. Rowling, she's done a huge donation to Carl Saeed, but to make sure we spend it. There's so much to do, but we can do it together. But mostly, whenever we see something wrong, we need to open our mouth. It doesn't matter who we upset. Politically, you'll always upset someone. And that's one thing that nobody can take away from you is your own voice. So now we'll do a Q&A. And just for clarity of the audience, I will be referring to Mr. Ravi Singh as Uncle G as a sign of respect for sick elderly male figures. Uncle G, you founded an organization named Kalsa Aid, with the tagline recognizing human race as one, as you mentioned. What does Kalsa mean to someone who's never heard the word Kalsa before? Basically, it's a term for some people to say brotherhood by, it's more of a concept of philosophy of someone who's a saint soldier. You can see the saint of Marlaway when it needs to be done, some needs to be done, when it needs to be a soldier, he'll defend humanity too. We also have the phrase deig teg fati. Deigteg degte means that we will serve food, will serve humanity, but we'll also defend that humanity with the sword. So Khalsa is part of that philosophy that we will always challenge the darkness. What would you say to someone who thinks they know a lot about Kalsai, or thinks that they know about you? What is some fun fact about Kalsaiad and fun fact about you that they wouldn't have expected? Fun facts. We hold the record for the most skydives, tandem skydives. We held it for that two months until somebody in America broke it. We were quite unhappy about that. We thought it might be forever. So that was about 10 years ago. So we had, I think, 131 jumps in one day. So, yeah. The other fun fact is I like zombie movies. I think that's about it. In providing aid, especially in wartime and conflict areas, as you mentioned, how do you handle bias? Especially being a person with opinions and belief on what is right and what is wrong, but then also leading an organization that is aimed at seeing people's humanity before anything else. How do you handle that? We don't really see any people's faiths or cultures or whatever. We just go and get help people, human beings. It's a great way of learning about people. I always told people like in 2014 when ISIS are rising in Iraq, we learned about the Yazidi people and the Assyrian Christian people. We didn't know who they were, minorities in Iraq, which is quite shameful for us. And then, yeah, so we don't really have any bias. We see people, anyone, it doesn't matter what background they are, as long as they need help, we get stuck in. And it's great because all the volunteers share that. All the volunteers share the same thing. So you know, that's one thing when they say, what do I need to volunteer? So you need to make sure that you don't have any prejudice towards anyone. You can't, not if you say you recognize the human race as one, then you can't pick and choose. That's really beautiful. And I know so much of that stems from concepts of Siki. in Sarbatapala and Cherdiqala. So Siki obviously has a focus also on foge and bravery. And, you know, in the history of Sikhism, there's a long history of battles and fighting for its right, whether it's for free speech or for freedom of religion of other faiths as well. How do you reconcile Sikh history with battles and your work, which also aims to heal people from battles and wartime? Yeah, I mean, our history inspires us. history shaped us who we are. The Sikh history is very young, we're only a few hundred years old, but our history is very rich. It's full of sacrifice, and we are here because of those sacrifices. It could be sacrifices in the 1700s, 1500s, it could be 1980s, you know, those sacrifices of, as we call our martyrs, they put us where we are today. So they make us fearless what they went through. went through, for instance, when we had gold coins on our heads by the Mughals. And every Sikh head was rewarded by a gold coin. And we still didn't give up the faith and we still survived in the jungles. So yeah, our history is our main inspiration. Uncle G, what would you say is the biggest mistake you've made throughout your leadership journey? I'm perfect so I don't really make mistakes. My wife says, sorry. No, it's not really mistakes. You learn a lot. The biggest thing would be failure. The biggest thing when I got on a plane is, are we going to fail to do a mission, launch our mission when we go on a mission? So mistakes are made every day, we're human beings. Mistakes are probably countless mistakes. but hopefully we learn from them. But the main thing is the biggest fear is always the failure. If we go in the organization, if we go in a disaster, the people, the supporters, they expect us to launch an operation ASAP. So you have to make sure that you live up to that expectation. I think something that definitely brought a lot of notoriety, especially to Khal Saeed, and to yourself as a public figure and humanitarian, was the farmers protest in 2020. You led Kalsa Aid to humanitarian intervention across India for farmers across who were affected by the bills imposed by the Indian government. As someone who created a fundraiser for Kalsaiiad myself, I remember the targeted messages I had received, but I still wonder, and my question for you, is how did you at a large scale, and the leader of this organization, navigate, targeted, hateful, and incorrect messages? I mean, we've got Amrubri Pete Singh, who's the India Head, who's with us today, thankfully, on the front row. And many of the trustees and individuals and ourselves were talked by the Indian intelligence agencies, put fake cases on us. We've had trolls. But then in 2017, when we helped the Rohingya refugees, and because they were Muslim, We had the far-right groups in India, absolute vile, vile tweets and social media attacks on Carl Saeed. Why are you helping them? They're snakes, they're terrorists, Sikh terrorists, helping Muslim terrorists. We had all these labels. So the trolls are out there. We do get trolled a lot, especially from the right-wing groups. But it's not something that really, to be honest, puts us off. That motivates us more. So if you say what motivates us, like I said, hates. You can turn hate into love. and you can hate it into humor. I like to humor people wind them up a little bit. I don't take anything personally now because he's mostly trolls. So yeah, once you go take part in the farmers' protest, you're going against the government. You're going against government one of the probably most propaganda expert in his field, the Indian government. They went after us. Even now, you know, we got targeted because of that, because it stood by the farmers. It's not like we stood against an enemy country. Farmers are Indian citizens. Our volunteers are Indian citizens. We're buying everything locally, supplying locally, they still turn against us. So it was a bit strange. But we will always stand against four people who are struggling against injustice. It doesn't matter how big the government or how much they come after you. We have to speak up. Uncleji, similar topic. There are many moments in sick history that were particularly defining moments. Moments that we can refer back on, just off the top of my head, you know, affecting the sick community may include the 1984 Sikh genocide. How would you say that sick leaders, for example, Jarniel Singh bin Dwarwele and many other sheheds and martyrs as well as the Khalistani movement have helped shape your leadership and your ways of approaching your work today. 1980s was a time when a lot of young Sikh men were targeted by the Indian state, purely because the movement grew at such a pace, they couldn't defeat it. So the best way was to target certain age groups, young men in rural areas who were joining the movement. One of them was my friends or my brother, we grew up together in Punjab in the village. and it was his murder by the Indian state that brought me this way. He was tortured in five different police stations in 1989, Charnji Singh Channi. We grew up together. I was in the UK. I lost touch with him. Only by chance I saw what happened to him in mid-90s. I found that he was killed in 89. The way he was tortured, I found everyone from the families, found the friends, from my mother. He was tortured so severely. And then there was a fake encounter. What the police do, they beat you up enough that almost every bond is broken, and then they basically stick a rifle or assault rifle in your hands, and they shoot you take a picture. And that became a very common theme. So all the young guys who stood up against the state, for me, they're heroes. I'll never turn against my own. So I'm announcing Bindranwal he knew there were tens of thousands soldiers coming in, and the 200 things with him that took place. things with him that took the stand, will forever be heroes of people like myself. It doesn't matter what people define me, we will always stand by them. Thank you for sharing. As a Sikh myself, I think we often look back at our history and we pull so much courage for maintaining our Sikhi and continuing to fight for sick rights because of the deep history that we have and the many Shaheeds in our history. Many Sikhs also inquire from a leader like yourself, how do they continue to fight against discrimination, challenges that they might be facing in school from a very young age with their turbans or patkas or beards and then also later on in their life as they navigate identifying as a Sikh in a public manner to a world that might not know about Sikhi. I mean, we're really in a good place at the moment that there are so many Sikh organizations in the West, especially America, Canada, UK, so many civil rights organizations now, amazing amount. You know, SELDA, SIC Coalition, all these organizations in North America, WSO, amazing organization. These are the organizations that have been there for a long time to fight these cases, discrimination, civil rights and etc. So I think best things to get to know what your organizations are doing. Unfortunately, we don't. Number one, we don't support the organisations until we need them, or we don't want to know about them. So the best way to tackle discrimination, education, teach yourself about the organization, what they offer, and then maybe a lot of the parents, especially in school where there's one or two operating children like long hair, they form a little group, and then sometimes they approach us for issues, then I would pass that case on to people in the community that we know. that we know. We're not experts in that civil rights, but we do know people who are. So it's important that people reach out. If they want to reach out to us, wherever we are, our chapters are, we'll be happy to receive that in India, Canada, UK, USA, wherever Australia, we will help. We'll put you on the right path to the right organization. I think the other question that we missed out, I missed out that you asked before. Well, the question of Khalistan, when you asked earlier, Everyone has the right to self-determination. Everyone has the right to seek that. Everyone. Even in the Indian Constitution, Indian High Court had ruled the Supreme Court. It's not a criminal offense to fight for the ideology of Khalistan. So most of the people that gave their lives of Kalistan in the 80s, they did so not for greed or power or personal money or whatever. They did it for the ideology. And the way the state is going at the moment, Indian state, I think they got bigger problems than Khalistan. The way they're going through this hate, right-wing hate, we need to reflect on that. All the good Indians, they need to really speak up against these, at the moment the current wave of hate that's going on. And to do that, people have to speak up. And I think they will create more than Khalistan if they don't stop this hate. I think that leads right into this next question probably in terms of speaking up and using our voice. We're at a place like the Oxford Union, a place of free thought and free expression, and that's the history of the legacy of this kind of an institution. What advice would you give to students at the Oxford Union, at the university, and then also six students in terms of speaking up, especially, amidst controversy and difficulties? I think like we live in these times now, we see people drowning at sea. People drowning at sea. What annoys me most isn't the fact the far-right groups are rejoicing when they drown and migrants. What really annoys me is when I hear Asians, especially Sikhs, suddenly become experts on migration and join these white-wing groups. We are countries full, we don't need. Hang on, our fathers, our forefathers struggled. Like my father was a POW. He worked for the British in the Royal Navy as a fireman, and he was a POW. We didn't come here through charitable handouts. Our people, the Sikhs, has spilled their blood all over the world in both wars and even now continues on UN missions around the world. So you've got to speak up. You've got to speak up. If a boat has sunk with 20 people on board, they're human beings. They're like you and me. They're like our forefathers who went for a better life. And so what? People say it's a migrant economic migrant. So what? We all hear because of that. We all want to better our lives. So we got to reflect who we are. If you're a Sikh especially, And I say it as it is. If he offends people, they offend people. I think Preeti Patel played a very good car recently. She put that Sikh judge in the front to make that judgment against those guys going to Rwanda. I disagree with it. I would resign if I was a judge. There's certain things you've got to look back in life saying, is that a job? Do I have to do that job? You guys are blessed. You're in one of the best institutions in the world. You're making great networks. You've got absolutely wonderful friends. Use that network to raise your voices. Go out there, make that change. Come with us if you want to see some of the world what we do. Give us two weeks of your life. Go on a mission. The world is full of good people. Generally, people are good. If I say to someone, we're going to go Iraq, first thing like, oh my God, you're going to go Iraq. What do you think people are just queuing up just to kill us over there? People are normal. Everyone just wants to get on with their lives. Don't believe the media. The media makes it so difficult for people. living in this country. First we devastate the countries and then we put people off travelling there in propaganda. So what's the word seek mean? Seek mean learn. So learn. You learn and then you pass it on. Don't believe what's written in the papers or online. Discover it. Guru Namakb, you're our first guru. We travel the world. There was no planes then. What's stopping you guys? So that's what I said that's my message to you guys. It's a beautiful place. and the healing can only begin with you guys. And that means everyone speaks up when you see something wrong. You know you might not get your votes later on if you send as an MP saying, this guy said it against this. What's your principle? There's no principles anymore. So many times we've been asked to sell up principles. I remember invitation, meet Indian Prime Nisto once when he was visiting. What for? I don't agree with the ideology. I don't agree with the ideology. Just to say a hand-cha, like a picture, so look I may. You have to have some sort of principles, especially on human rights. Our guru, ninth guru, he gave his life defending a different faith because he believed everybody has right to believe whatever they want to believe. Could be a Muslim, could be a Hindu, could be a Christian. This world doesn't need this hate and it's tolerance. tolerance, acceptance, reaching out to your neighbor. Even in Christian Bible, they said, love thy neighbor. Our neighbors are the world. We live in a small world. So that's what your responsibilities are. Thank you for that, Uncle G. Many people would say that so much of Kalsaiad already fills something that Siki has a healing power of in the world. What do you think is the future of Kalsai'id? Are there other medicines that Kalsai'iqaed? that Khal Saeed can provide in terms of this worldly matter. Like I said, the concept of Langer Community Kitchen is one most powerful. Deg, teg, fati. We got the dig, we got the dig. We have to respect both. In a world where we're becoming fast, becoming leaders in arms exports. Unfortunately, UK is one of those. When Sikh says, Deg, Deg, Fati, rings the alarm bells. why we can sell weapons around the world by Faseeks, they take Fafati, it's a problem. So the future for us, I think to build a better world, Langer is a beautiful concept. We can feed the world. You know, in the Sikki, they say, Sava Lak, that a sea can fight 125,000. It's the spirit of that fight, isn't it? That we can then feed 125,000 to. In this world where there's sort of food shortages, Lengar, we can. could be a great answer to it. So yeah, we can change it. We can heal it. I think that's beautiful. And we're going to have one more quick question here. Then we're going to open it up to audience questions. We'll probably have one or two. So the last question is, for you, Uncle-ji, what does seva mean to you? Seva meaning selfless service in the sick philosophy. What does it mean to you? Well, I remember doing Seva in the Gurdora when I was young, serving water to the people eating Lunggur in the Gurdora and cleaning up after when I was a kid. So now I'm more like facilitator of SEVA. I don't really do SEVA, you could say. I'm a facilitator. So we give an opportunity to anybody wants to SEVA, the selfless service around the world in a refugee camp to serving the homeless in the UK where we've got a great team, Lengarate team. So I've become a facilitator. SIVA is an amazing concept. It's a concept I don't think is known in or is anywhere in other faiths. That selfless service. That we serve others above ourselves. And that's taught also from our Gurbani and our Punjabi roots. You go to any Punjabi household could be in Pakistan, could be in India, wherever it's Punjabi's, you won't go hungry. We insist you eat. We'll give you shelter. We'll give you food. We'll protect you. That's what we are. And that's automatic. It's instilled in us when we help abroad. We don't need to fake anything. We don't need to create a personality. That personality was being created through Gravani and our culture. That Punjabi is the most generous people. So Seva is an amazing concept, and that's what's changing a lot of the world here. So many homeless groups now, so many seek homeless groups. It's amazing. We will now turn to audience questions. So if you can just raise your hand, if you would like that. to ask a question to Ravi uncle. Right here, the woman in the black, please. Oh, can sit down? Oh, I'll have you sit down. Thank you. Why, Krzika Khadza, why Krishiki Faday. I suppose being an ambitious woman who wants a career and then also has expectations of marriage and wants to start a family as well. How do you balance your family life, your private, life versus the public life, the traveling, the helping the entire human world. How do you create that balance? Well, my wife's right next to you. So she finds the balance. So even like packing the stuff like last minute traveling, it's like suddenly like she knows the different colored turbans I need in the suitcase as well. So it's a when the kids are younger is very difficult. It's been a struggle when they were younger, like they've always struggle when they're young because you're balancing it's not easy so you need to have someone support you like my miss is there with the kids is as they're grown up it makes it easier but when they're young kids it's it's extremely difficult because you both go to balance you know nowadays cost of living is quite high both need to work so unless you're like a have that real zeal to to be involved. It's a lot of sacrifices, especially for the kids. You go away so much. Next thing, you know, they've grown up. And you look back saying, well, where did that time go? You know, the kid was only born the other day. Now he's like 21, 22, whatever. So, and you spend most of the time on travels. So now, in the last couple of years, I spent home because I'm waiting for a transplant, kidney transplant. But other than that, I was always out. So it is, It is something you look back, you think, well, you know, I've missed so much kids growing up. Not easy. Thank you. Thank you for your service. The chair recognizes the woman in the second row in the black. Thank you so much, Uncle Gee. As Casa Aid goes into new geographies and as conflict continues to arise in different parts of the world, what ambitions and hopes do you have for Casa Aid in the next five to ten years? I think ambition, when people, some of the people ask me what's the biggest achievement. My biggest achievement is that we have a whole generation of young Sikhs who become humanitarian following the work of Carl Saeed. And that still remains the same goal. It's not about money, it's not about fame, it's about molding that generation, continue to mold a young generation into humanitarian. So especially when we face such changes. changes around the world this is more important so we need to inspire people to be humanitarian if it's about money then I suppose I wouldn't be doing half the stuff when you chase money really happy you never is content we're quite content and the next goal is to get you guys involved in Carl Saeed create that next generation next wave of humanitarian and we do need those We've got one more question. Do we have a sing maybe in the audience? I'd like to, the chair recognizes in the purple. So I follow you on Twitter and I find a really inspirational, the strength that you show to continue undeterred despite all the trolls and the hate you get online. But I also notice that you get a lot of doubters from within the sick community people saying that, you know, why are you spending resources that could be spent in Punjab or you know the causes of the things that are necessary there so how do you answer to those critics yeah we've we got two types of trolls one is the far-right Indian trolls and then you got the trolls within the community who will never promote your work so if you look at some of the tweets and you go back to social media they will never tweet or retweet or share Carl Saeed work and we're doing so much in Punjab and we got the Amrpri is here from Punjab. You know, amount of work that Carl Saeed is probably unmatched by other organizations from abroad in Punjab. And we ask people to come and have a look and report it yourselves. So yeah, there's always more we can do and we're always planning to do more. But Punjabi is a place which is difficult to work in. As I said, those people will never share our work. So we have to expect there will be some sort of resistance in some sort of resistance in some. some quarters or from established organizations to feel threatened by the rise of Carl Saeed. But we are always open. If there's any registered organization in Punjab want to work with us, we always welcome it. I've been writing about it. Let's work together. Tell us what you want to do. Give us a plan. Give us a proposal and we look into it. Unfortunately, we'll never get rid of the trolls. But I know for our fact that our work remains unmatched. And I hope one day when you go to Punjab, you can spend time with Amar Prid and have a look. The hardships they face working in the field is a difficult place to work. A lot of government restrictions as well. Thank you. Thanks for your service. You're doing a wonderful job. Ravi uncle.
