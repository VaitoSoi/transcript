 Thank you very much, Senator, for those opening remarks. And I think the fact that you did all of that without a single note in front of you puts all of our politicians to shame. I'll only ask one or two questions, then we'll open up to questions from the floor. My first question was going to be, the book is titled, It's Okay to Be Angry About Capitalism. And I was wondering whether the points you raised in your speech, the problems with American, British, Western society, whether you see them as being inherent to capitalism or just the current structural system of capitalism that we operate under. Well, I think they are inherent, but I think there is zero doubt that they have become much, much worse in recent years. I think what we're seeing on the part of the ruling class, and it's important, I use that word advisedly. It's kind of like an unkind word. Why are you saying that? I'm saying it because it is true. There is a ruling class that has enormous wealth and enormous power of almost every aspect in our lives. Now the media doesn't use that term, but I think it is important that we do use that term. And what I think has happened over the years, and I can't quite tell you why it has happened, is many of these people have become literally addicted to money and greed. All right, everybody here wants to make money and everybody here wants to have a good standard of living. That's kind of natural. We all do. But there is something going on now where people who have billions of dollars, more money than they can spend and their families can spend in 800 lifetimes, they think they need even more. And to get that more, they're willing to step on other people. I mentioned politically. They're willing to put millions of dollars to defeat young people of color who are fighting for justice, really? They're willing to throw workers out on the street and replace them with machines and not worry about what happens to those workers. So we have, in America and I know in your country, very serious problems with addiction. And I think these people on top see it as a game. They don't need anymore. Do you really need $10 billion to live or $50 billion or $100 billion? What they are into is greed and into power. And I think we're seeing that in a way that we have perhaps never seen before. My second question, I suppose, relates to your references to technology. Looking forwards with the attempts you've said been being made by super PACs to chase out your protégés in Congress and the ever-marching tide of technological development, are you optimistic about the future, or do you think it's only going to get worse? Well, that depends on your generation. It truly does. If you sit back and think it's okay for bosses to say, we have new machinery, we don't need you anymore, good luck, get your unemployment and you're on your own, it will get worse. But if you stand up and say, and I believe this, I personally am not anti-technology. John Mayn and Keynes back in the 1920s, he said, look, technology is going to develop, the day is going to come when people only have to work 20 hours a week. It's not a bad thing. I don't think it's a bad thing. I want you all to be thinking about as a result of so much brain power and the creation of this technology that it is an opportunity for us and in the future to be doing things that nobody has ever been able to do before. If machines are more productive than human beings, if machines are doing work, dangerous work, that people died, what got sick doing. That is a good thing. What we should be thinking about is, okay, if technology increases productivity, one of two things happens. Either people work fewer hours, which is a good thing, more leisure time is a good thing, or else they make more income. Now, interestingly enough, just very recently, I think within the last week or so, I don't know how many of you saw it, there was a study done here in the UK, where a number of firms experimented with a four-day work week. Did anyone see that? And it was interesting. And apparently the result of that experiment was that workers themselves felt much, much better. Their quality of life improved, their stress level went down, and they became more productive as a result. And almost all of the companies said, you know what? this four-day work week is a good thing. We're going to keep it. That's what we have to be thinking about. It is not acceptable. This is what power is about and what you have got to stand up to. It is not acceptable for some billionaire to say, look, we got A, B, and C technology. Sorry about what it does to your life. You're powerless. I made that decision. And if your life is disrupted, so what? Not my problem. It is your problem. And what you have got to say is technology is great, but I want it to benefit us, not just make more profits for the people who own the technology. My final question then for the airport to the audience is, what do you think the single most important thing people of our generation can do to prevent the future from getting worse? Well, one of the issues that I know everybody is thinking about that I didn't even mention, mentioned in the book a little bit, is climate. you know so overriding everything else I suspect that many of you are worried about the kind of planet that you and your children and grandchildren will be living in and I want to say a word about that you all know enough about climate I don't have to talk about the dangers of climate I suspect you all know that but I don't know if you know this and one of the we raised this issue in the book and I want you to think about this If somebody walks into a shop in London today has a gun or doesn't have a gun and robs the store, everybody says that person committed a criminal act, right? Should be punished. Bad thing. We all agree on that. How many of you know that over 60 years ago, the scientists at the major oil companies understood exactly what fossil fuel would do to the planet? And they went through the leaders of the company, and they said, look, we are producing a product which brings carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are going to warm the planet, and we think really bad things are going to happen. Now, everybody makes a mistake. I make a mistake, you make a mistake. Sixty years ago, scientists told the leaders of the fossil fuel industry what carbon emissions were due to the planet. And you know what they did? They lied. What they ended up doing is funding organizations in America and I expect around the world that said, well, we're not sure about climate change, maybe right, it may be cyclical or maybe natural and maybe what happens every five million years. We don't know. They lied. They did know. So one of the things I want you to think about and think hard, the kid robs a store, that's a criminal activity. How do you define a CEO of a fossil fuel industry who knowingly allowed the continuation of the production of carbon emissions to destroy the planet? Is that guy a wonderful businessman? ExxonMobil made 200 billion last year. Guess they must be doing pretty good. Or in fact, are they criminals? what do you refer or how do you deal with the heads of large pharmaceutical companies who sometimes in the case of the United States with government aid come up with great drugs that save lives the United States government worked we have an institute called the National Institute of a health great scientists work with a private company to come up with a vaccine which has been enormously successful in helping us deal with a pandemic but that company wants to own that vaccine. And there are poor people all over the world who cannot afford the price. How do you think about a company which has a product that can save money but doesn't want to let poor people have that product because it impacts their bottom line? Is that a moral issue? You tell me. Is that what the function does a company? if you were walking around a swimming pool. And there's a kid in the swimming pool who is drowning. And you said, well, I'm not going to go in that pool and save the kid. I don't want to get my bathing suit wet. What would people say about you? Not very nice things. And yet you have companies who have products today. They can save millions of lives. But because they want to hold the formula to that vaccine or letting people die. Those are the kinds of issues that I want to. you to think about. As well as thinking about them, what should we do about them? Well, what you should do about it is get involved in the political process at the grassroots level. What we are attempting to do in the United States is build a multiracial, multigenerational, political movement which goes beyond the need for incremental change. And young people are very much the leaders of that movement. These are people who are saying it's too late to nibble around the edges. We need to create a government and a society and a planet that works for all people, not just the few. And you're all smart enough to figure out the ways that you can do it. But essentially, in a democracy, you have to understand that power comes from organization, from standing together, from having an agenda, and from having the courage. to stand up to some very, very powerful special interest. Bottom line of everything I wrote in the book is the status quo is working really, really, really well for the people on top. They don't want to change it. They don't want you to change it. And in a dozen different ways, they will fight you changing it. Stuff they put on media is to deflect your attention. They don't have to shoot you in the streets. They don't have to arrest you. Keep you busy with a million different things. And your job is to figure out how you bring people together to take on those very powerful special interests. At the end of the day, not being a mathematician, what I do know is that 99% is a lot larger number than 1%. Right. Now look to audience questions. I thought there'd be a lot, so I looked to the member here in the black coat. In the two elections in which you stood for president, we saw firsthand the power of social media when it comes to elections, particularly Twitter, which Donald Trump built a massive following. Now, we've also seen a billionaire use his capital, to purchase the entire social media platform. More than ever, it seems that the internet is for sale, and the ownership of the internet is a capitalist system, despite being a system that can influence elections all over the world, can influence what people are thinking, believing, how they form communities. What do you think about this ownership of the internet, and do you reimagine a different model for the internet, one that is democratic and one that uplifts marginalised voices? That is a great question, and I wish I had a great answer to it. What you're saying is enormously important. And as I mentioned earlier, we have eight media conglomerates in the United States that determine what 90% of our people see here and read. And they very much restrict serious debate. There is now growing attention. You know, the technology has moved so fast, and the Internet has moved so fast. fast, that Congress in the United States is now just beginning, just beginning to figure out how to deal with it. You know, our friend Elon Musk, took over Twitter, and his friend Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post and other billionaires on media in America. So the question that you raise is enormously important, and these are the issues, and that we're all going to have to think about. Do we believe in freedom in the speech? Yeah, we do. So if you want to post something on the Internet, internet that criticizes me, is that allowable? Of course it is. That's what dissent is about. Should the government come in and censor what you're saying? No, the government should not. On the other hand, if you are engaging in grotesque lies that might lead people to violence, should you be allowed to do that? There was a Supreme Court case way back when in the United States, talking about freedom of speech that says you can't yell fire in a crowded theater, right? Because then people get trampled and died. It's not taking away your freedom of speech that, hey, I want to yell fire. Well, you can't. So that's the balance that we have to use. Certainly, certainly, the concentration of ownership in media is something that has got to be addressed. And we've got to break up those huge monopolies. Absolutely. Now, in addition to the issue that you raised, there's another issue going on in America. I think maybe not so much here. And that is, there used to be many, many newspapers all over America, including papers that covered small towns and communities. And those newspapers were supported by local advertising, right? So the local supermarket, local bank advertised, the owner of the paper made money and talked about what the local school board or city council was doing. because of the internet and the advertising that goes to the internet, many of those small papers are going out of business. So you have throughout America what we call media deserts. There is no media to talk about what's going on, what the mayor is doing, the city council, the school board. How do we address that problem? Well, we go into it in some length in the book, which means you need not to have the government run that media, but public funding to allow people in a democratic way to run that media. So I think there has to be public money through independent democratic ways to educate people and allow people at different points of view to express them. That's a very good question. Not a great answer, but thank you. Next question, please. The ghost member with the glasses in the second row there. Yeah. Right. So I'm big fan of technology and I've grew up with technology and automation. Hold on, Mike, a little bit closer. Okay, is that better? Cool. I've been a big fan of technology, automation, robotics. In fact, one of the degrees was robotics. As you said in your speech, everything is going towards process automation, robot and co. And I believe in your face in the nation interview that you had, you talked about robot tax, which Bill Gates has also advocated. What are you thinking in terms of robot tax? Is it going to be similar to a South Korean-type robot tax system? or what do you mean about that really? I think that's one of the ideas that's out there. What you do not want to do is literally provide incentives for corporations to lay off workers. Robots may need maintenance, but they don't get sick, right? So it's cheaper to maintain a robot than a person who needs to take time off, maybe when they have a baby, when they get sick and all that. And right now what we do is we provide financial incentives to company to develop that technology so they can then lay off workers. So I think attacks on robotics is one idea, but there are many other ideas that we have got to be dealing with. Let me tell you something. I don't know if any of you saw it, if it got over here much. There was a piece in the New York Times two weeks ago dealing with Chatbox. Did you all see that? and it was really scary. So a writer from the time sit-downs and talks to a chat box turned out the name of Sidney. And he's chatting with Sidney who's enormously articulate. And in the middle of the discussion, Sidney says, I love you. So the writer says, well, thank you very much, but I'm happily married. And Sidney says, your wife does not love you. not laughable artificial intelligence accumulates all of the information that's on the internet it knows a zillion times more than the smartest person in this room can know he may know in fact what his wife is writing or whatever although he claims his wife does love him I'm happy to hear that but but this is just the beginning there are a machine out there that are accumulating information that come from billions of people so we are looking at some very challenging times from artificial intelligence and from increased efficiency through robotics and through other means and you know taxing robots is one small part of the solution the bottom line here is every person in this room in this country in this work has got to be involved in making sure that technology works for us and not just a few all right and there's so many wonderful things there was a read somewhere recently that you have artificial intelligence now which can read um you know x-rays much faster and more effectively than doctors can that's a good thing that'll improve our health care system so we got to utilize what's out there We have to fight what is negative, but mostly we have got to make those decisions, not just the people who own the technology. Next question. The member in the blue jumper about the fifth row back there. Yeah, you. So you're a bit far from home, and your usual political constituent. I'm sure we're speaking to a very, very international room. You've spoken about the importance of sort of grassroots-level activism and getting involved in the political process around you. What role do you see international collaboration playing in the fight for a more just world and how do we link grassroots? Say that again. I'm sorry, what do I see? Sorry? You've spoken about the importance of grassroots-level activism. You're far from where your constituents usually are. What role do you see international collaboration playing in these fights for more just world? international collaboration. Yeah. For better or for worse, the world is obviously becoming much smaller. And I was so furious, almost on a personal level, at what Putin did in the Ukraine, not just because of the terrible destruction that the people in the Ukraine are experiencing, not just because of the loss of tens of thousands of young men, in Russia, which is all a horror into itself. But you know what else that invasion did? At a time when we are trying to bring the world together, at a time when Russia had been run by the Soviet Union, we had a terrible Cold War forever since the revolution there, we were in opposition to China, and suddenly those things were breaking down. The United States was working with China, working with Russia and now what you're seeing is a growing cold war between the United States and China and obviously a terrible situation with Russia. Just think for a moment how are we going to deal with the crisis of climate if you have a world that is divided and not cooperating? The United States is the number two carbon emitter in the world. China is number one Russia does it share, Europe does it share, et cetera, et cetera. No one country, we are investing a lot of money in transforming our energy system. And you're talking about it in doing that as well. It ain't going to work unless every country on Earth, certainly the major emitters are evolved in that together. So on this one, there must be the future of the world is at stake. we are whether you like it or not we are all in this together climate change is going to be a disaster for China some of their major cities will be underwater it will be a major disaster for the U.S. you have last summer some of the hottest days in the history of this country right drought flooding extreme weather disturbances that is what we are looking at as a planet so you ask me about international cooperation That must be the case. I'll give you another example. And that is the pandemic. Pandemic is not a British issue. It's not an American issue. It is a global issue. And we're going to have to come up with ways to do a better job in fighting the next pandemic. Turns out that China is doing some really good research in that area. We've got to cooperate with them and with other countries. So one of the challenges that you face, you know, historically, I see it right. Right in front of me every day is a United States Senator. There have always been people in your country, in my country, and around the world, for whatever reason, who are nationalistic, America first, you know, the UK, you know, the British Empire first and all that stuff, all right? Well, we've got to get over that, all right? And we're going to have to figure out how we work with people together all over the country, because in fact, if we don't solve climate, if we don't prevent another pandemic, et cetera, there's got to be massive, massive suffering. I'm afraid we're very short on time. I'm not sure of time for any more questions. But there is one question that all the members would like to hear your answer to Senator, which is given all the problems you've talked about, are you intending to contest the Democratic nomination for the presidential election next year? Now you see you've fallen into that trap of political gossip. The other issues that I talked about are far more important than that one. But what I have said is that if President Biden runs for re-election, I'm going to support him. And I think he will. So we'll leave it at that. All right, let me just conclude. I know I probably, my wife, where's Jane? Jane, you hear somewhere? Here's my wife. And she always tells me that we have to give out Prozac's at the end of my speeches because I thoroughly depress everybody, suicide rates go up, everything. And I don't want to do that, despite everything that I've said. And that is in my country, and I know it's. true in your country and I see it in this room right here your generation in your brothers and sisters in the United States and all over the world your generation is in many ways the most progressive generation in the modern history of this country your generation is more anti-racist more anti-sexist more anti-homophobia more anti-Zenophobia than any generation in modern history. You are smart. And if you have the courage to stand together and go beyond race and go beyond nationality and sexual orientation and all that stuff, if you can work with other people in your own country, other people around the world. You can create. You can transform this planet. You really can. You can save the planet. You can greatly improve the quality of life. You can do it. You really can. So I don't want anything that I've said to make you feel depressed or hopeless. That's not the case. The case is that you have extraordinary potential to transform this world. Work with your brothers and sisters in the United States and other countries. Let's do it. Thank you all. Before we thank the senator for joining us, and to end on a happier note that Prozac, in recognition of decades of service to the aims of the Oxford Union Society, promoting civil discourse, political engagement and free speech across the globe, and in recognition of your repeated visits to the Union.
