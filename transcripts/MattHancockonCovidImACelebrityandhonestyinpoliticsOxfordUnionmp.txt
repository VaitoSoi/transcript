 Good afternoon, Honourable Members and honoured guests. It's a pleasure to see so many of you in the Chamber this evening as we welcome the Right Honourable Matt Hancock MP for an address and Q&A in the Chamber. We're delighted to see the interest engagement that this event has prompted, but we also request that across this evening's event you behave in a line with the society's forms of the House and treat our guest with the respect and allow him to be heard. There will be time for audience questions at the end. After Mr. Hancock and I have left the chamber, please leave as quickly as possible so that our committee can reset the chamber for the debate on same-sex marriage in the Church of England this evening. Without further ado, let me introduce our speaker for this afternoon, not that he needs much introduction. Mr. Hancock is a former Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Member of Parliament for West Suffolk. He has previously served as Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, before serving as Health Secretary during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mr. Hancock resigned after being caught breaking government COVID guidelines. In autumn of 2022, Mr. Hancock went on, I'm a celebrity, get me out of here, finishing third. He has recently published a memoir entitled The Pandemic Diaries. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming Mr. Matt Hancock. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and it's great to be back in this August's room. And I'm frankly astonished to see so many of you here and delighted. I look forward to a really good discussion this evening. This is the first time that I've done a live event like this. since arriving back from my recent trip to Australia. And so that's the first time I've heard the intro with the Australia bit added in, which I don't know why all of you were laughing. I think, and I certainly hope you were voting for me. It's changed my life in many ways. One of the ways is that it takes me longer to walk down the street because I'm stopped for selfies. And the thing that happens all the time is people stop me for a selfie and they say something like, my mum thinks you're great. And I say, well, what about you? And then they look sheepish. And they say, can I have a selfie for my mum? Now, I like being, you know, people's mum's favourite, I'm a celebrity contestant. But I do find it quite, I do find it quite insulting. And what I much prefer is a good, robust debate. And I have that as well from time to time. And no doubt we will have that this evening. The reason I accepted this invitation as my first on my return is because the Oxford Union is such an extraordinary place and a place that has been at the heart of public debate and the training of debate over the centuries. And I've never actually spoken from this podium, so it's a great honour. And Oxford matters to me for a lot of reasons, but for two in particular that are really important and close to my heart. The first, of course, is that this is where I came as an undergraduate. I arrived as a very green, wet behind the ears, 17-year-old at Exeter College to read PPE. I had an absolutely fantastic time. I had a seminal moment at the end of my first term when my tutor took me to one side and said, Matt, you've got the gift of the gab, you can talk, but you'll have. your essays are terrible. I thought this isn't going very well. He said, I think that you are dyslexic. And nobody had mentioned this to me before. I knew that I was rubbish at languages, and at English, I'd struggled. I'd done A-levels in math-based subjects, math, physics, computing, economics, and I can't, for the life of me now think why I applied to do an essay-based degree. But I arrived doing PPE, I struggled significantly in my first term, and I got diagnosed as dyslexic. And then the education department here taught me how to read and write. They re-taught me. And that has been the absolute foundation of what I've been able to do since. Because without being identified as dyslexic, and then given the support I needed to learn how I can read, then I wouldn't have been able to reach the top table and to do what I did. So Oxford is very close to my heart for that reason. Second reason, which we'll come on to in a bit more detail, is the pandemic, of course. In the pandemic, Oxford University's research perform better than any other single university in the whole world. So that converted an entirely emotional bias towards Oxford as an institution. And by the way, I did also go to Cambridge, and I don't say this in my talks there. it turned that into real life-saving research and the performance of this university during the pandemic has been absolutely extraordinary we all of course know about the vaccine I'll tell you a story about the vaccine AstraZeneca were critical to making that vaccine they really wanted it to be called the AstraZeneca vaccine Pfizer had successfully elbowed out Biontek as the name of the other main vaccine at the time and I insisted that it was called the Oxford vaccine or the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine and to try to make sure that the actual science underpinning it was the thing that was recognized. But it wasn't just the vaccine. It was the recovery trial. It was our world in data. I don't know if any of you have been involved in that project. Absolutely brilliant cutting-edge research that has saved many, many lives. So here I am. Unlike many of the committee here, I once stood for the union. I didn't try very hard. I was doing it as a favour for a friend. I didn't get elected and nor did he. And I've just about got over it. I then from here, I worked in my family business. And this was the reason, really, that I ended up in politics, because the business that my mother ran and my stepfather wrote the code was a computer software business. If you've ever typed your postcode into the internet and it brings up your address, we wrote that software. My stepdad wrote that software. So I hope he's saved you some time over the years with your online shopping. and in the recession in the 90s, that business nearly collapsed. And this was a seminal moment for me because I'd gone from thinking that I was interested in the technology and I was interested in the business, good, important things. And suddenly I thought, how does the whole world work that a perfectly successful business can nearly get knocked over by something completely outside of their control? I'll return to this theme later. And what happened was that a big customer couldn't pay their bill. And we knew that if by the end of the week that business, if that check didn't arrive from our main customer, if the check didn't derive by the end of the week, the business would go under. My parents would lose their jobs. They employed about just over a dozen people at the time. They would lose their jobs. And it was a harrowing moment. And it made me ask the bigger question. of how does the whole system work? How can you ensure better that people don't go through that and that people can build prosperity for themselves and for others? And that led me to study economics and PPE here, but it also then led me into public policy, because ultimately, public policy is about making the world a better place and I know that sounds glib, but it's actually real. And having worked at the Bank of England for a bit, I realized that actually the big decisions are rightly made in Westminster. In a democracy, the big decisions should be taken by elected politicians. And so I moved over to Westminster. One of the observations I'd have about politics over the last 20 years is that it goes through, cycles, but there's some basic facts, there's some basic elements which don't change. And the central one of these is the need to engage with what people think, what people want, and what people hope for. And I'm reminded, as I tell this story, of something that happened when I first stood for Parliament, because having gone in and moved over to Westminster, I then decided I wanted to run myself, and I stood for Parliament. And I was very, I was new to it. I had this, I'd been selected for this seat, which had been conservative for 100 years or so. And so I was expected to win it, and I was going around campaigning. I went to the end of a long lane, a road, and there was a farm at the end of it. and there was a farmer leaning on his gate at the end of this road. And I wanted to pluck up conversation. I was enthusiastic. I went up to him and I said, So, have you lived there all your life? And he said, nope, not yet. And in that reply, I thought to myself, the wisdom of the quiet people who don't, get themselves involved is something you've always got to listen to in politics. The idea that this guy could see me as a wet behind the ears young 30-something-year-old and thought that my question was banal and ridiculous and wanted to take the Mickey and more of that later. So in politics I served in a number of different roles as the as the president said but of course I'm the you know the the one that I got me into the cabinet was at DCMS, where I was responsible for not only, by night I was responsible for the theatres and the film industry and the cultural environment of the country, which is wonderful and by day for technology, the broadband rollout. But the thing that, the job that I was then asked to do by Theresa May was to become health secretary. and of course I'm most well known for being health secretary during the pandemic and for me the pandemic began and the work on it began when I first read about a new pneumonia in China which I read in the in the Times newspaper New Year's Day 2020 and it was on about it was a news in a news in brief item on about page 8, and I remember thinking I better have a look at that, and asked for a briefing on it when I got back into the office. I got back into the office on about the 5th or 6th of January, and had a briefing from Chris Witty, and he said, essentially, we don't know anything about it yet. The Chinese have regarded it as serious enough to put out a warning about it, but we don't really do. know, and there are these warnings from time to time, but we are worried about this, and we're keeping an eye on it. And that evening, I was voting in the House of Commons, and I saw the Prime Minister, your former president, and I went up to the Prime Minister, I said, Boris, there's something you need to know about. There's a new disease in China that we're quite worried about. and Boris had just won this extraordinary majority. He'd just been able to unpick the knot that was Brexit by calling an election and then winning it. He had five years, probably 10 years ahead of him, in office as Prime Minister. He'd managed to unite the North and the South in the way that no Tory politician had been able to do for at least a generation. he was excited at the prospects of what he could get done. The last thing he wanted to hear about was some disease in China that might come and take over the world. And he said to me, it's your job to worry about these things. He said, keep an eye on it, Matt, and let me know if there's a problem. And on we went. Clearly, the virus grew and the pandemic. grew. And the single biggest problem that we had in handling it at the start was a total lack of information, a complete uncertainty about what this meant. And I think one of the interesting things reflecting on it now is that having to make huge decisions like decisions over lockdown based on very little information, but crucially also based on very little experience of what is viable in a liberal democracy was extremely difficult. And at that time, I relied on the thinking that I had done here. And I explain it in this way, that we may debate the confines of this, but the British system is essentially one based on an agreement across a broad swave of society and reflected across a broad swave of politics, that a liberal democracy in which you're allowed to get on with what you want to do so long as you don't harm others is the best way of living our lives. That is essentially the Enlightenment settlement that underpins our way of life, it underpins our common law. Of course, there are always debates around, around how you implement that in a free society. But that is essentially the approach to government that the major parties subscribe to. There have been aberrations. The Corbyn Labor Party approach did not accept that. There have been aberrations on the right as well, although I would argue not within the mainstream of the Conservative Party. And I think back to the... to the 30s when that was most under pressure in this country. But the problem of a pandemic is that the so-called harm principle in which you should allow people essentially to be able to get on with their lives so long as they don't harm others, that harm principle, when a virus can pass from one person to the next, without the first person knowing about it, the harm principle suddenly becomes central to all questions of policy across the whole piece and ultimately justify action to keep people safe that is radical compared to what could have been done in any other time. And this change in political philosophy ultimately requires and calls for much more interventionist action from government than you would ever expect or allow in a liberal democracy. And this sort of highfaluting political theory came crashing down on us in March, late February and March 2020. because we went from a world in which for at least 70 years it had been accepted that it is entirely normal and right to have liberty and freedom as the prime mainstay of politics into a world in which we regarded intervention in extremely personal parts of people's lives as valid and reasonable. And the British state has never done that before. And the reason is simple, that we knew that if we didn't, then the passage of the virus from one person to the other would lead to a very, very large number of deaths, probably over half a million. And we knew that that would lead to the collapse of the NHS as we'd seen in Italy. And over a period of about a fortnight, a whole load of politicians whose natural instinct is towards freedom had to make these intervention decisions. And we had to do so on the basis of very little information. But at least the way we thought about it, we had some education about in principle. That's what happened in March 2020. It's how we came to the decisions about lockdown. And what ultimately happened was that I was sat in the cabinet room around the table, Boris on the other side of the table, Rishi at the end of the table, Chris Witty was there, Patrick Valence and a couple of others. And Chris Witty and I talked about it, and there were proposals on the table for what might have to happen, to education, to schools, to all the other institutions of life. and Chris Witty was very worried that actually what was needed was not just essentially tinkering but a whole scale change in behaviour by society and that was the only way we were going to stop this thing and he said we've got to make a bigger behavioural change and I turned to the Prime Minister and I said Prime Minister we're going to have to tell people to stop all unnecessary social contact And he said, well, you better tell him then. And he came to the view, actually, that as Prime Minister, he probably better tell them. And he did. And the rest of the lockdown and all the consequences which you all lived through, and I lived through, and the whole country lived through, flowed from that. The basis of it was sound, necessary, and just all of the details were completely. unknown to us at the time. We had to work them all out in incredible speed. It led to extraordinary complications and irrationalities within the rules and how they were applied. But ultimately it was necessary to keep people safe. And ultimately, we discovered, we found out that the only way out of the pandemic was the vaccine. And that brings us back to Oxford. because the vaccine that was developed here, as well as the American, the Pfizer-Biontec, German-American vaccine, managed to get us out of the pandemic. And here, I'm incredibly proud that we have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. But that again brought us back to thinking about the intellectual purpose behind a vaccine, because a vaccine not only protect, you, but it protects other people. But we all know that vaccines also have side effects. And so we got into the great debate which you would have been more engaged in in your, as then teenagers and in your 20s largely, about who should take them? Because the simple narrow view, which is the safest view, is that you should take a vaccine if it protects you more than the risk from the side effects. from the side effects. But there is also an essentially social communitarian view that because the vaccine makes it less likely you will pass the disease to somebody else, then so you should also take the vaccine to protect others. Now, we took the cautious approach and vaccines were only recommended by the clinicians when the evidence showed that they were beneficial to the individual, or at least not net harmful, when you took into account all of the downsides and all of the incidents that happened, which were all publicly logged, versus the benefit. But there is a broader, again, communitarian as opposed to liberal individualistic approach to the fact that you should take a vaccine in order to protect others. So the point of setting this out, as I have to you today, is that the thinking that you do here and the work that you do here is critical to how to have to you. you learn to think about the big decisions that you may need to take. And it certainly was for me. Who knows what those decisions will be in future? And I'll end on two forward-looking points. The first is this, that there is a great debate right now about the future of health care and the future of the NHS, which clearly has been under huge pressure. My view on that is that the NHS is an enormous, enormously valuable national asset. It is one of the best health systems in the world, and certainly in terms of the amount that we pay through our taxes for it. It is one of the best value for money systems in the world, and it needs reform in order to survive. Ultimately, it needs more people, but it has record numbers of doctors and nurses, and still the pressures are enormous. We need to do more to keep healthy in the first place because it shouldn't be just about fixing people up once they've gone wrong. It should be about protecting people because it is essentially an insurance system in which we all pay the Jews through our taxes and we should try to make sure that people are given the support they need to be healthier in the first place. But the absolutely central thing to make it last and to make it survive over the decades to come is that it needs to be far, far better at using modern technology, both for developing the most effective treatments in the world, which we do but could do much better, all the way through to making sure that it is as efficient as possible. And I come back to the vaccination, because we built that system based on a proper data architecture, it meant that when you turned up for your vaccine appointment, you only had to wait five to ten minutes, and you could even choose when you wanted to go, and you can't do that for almost any other NHS appointment, which is a mistake. And that, data, that underpinning data structure needs to be radically improved within the NHS to make it survive for the medium term. The second thing, which is absolutely vital today, is to make sure we're prepared for the next pandemic. And to be prepared for the next pandemic, we need to learn the lessons from the last one. We have an inquiry coming up which will do that. I published my book in order to add to that, contribute to that debate. But I am seriously worried that there is not enough focus on preparing for the next time this happens to protect us all in future. We saw the news just today that the latest bird flu, which is virulent amongst birds, you might have noticed there's not as many seagulls in the sky as there were, the latest bird flu has moved into mammals, and that is a warning that we should not ignore. And yet, and yet, the budgets for preventing the next pandemic have been cut drastically, and I think the preparation and the work there to ensure that we are ready to go and we learn the lessons from the last one, I think that work needs to be redoubled and needs to be supported and invested in. And finally, something about me. I came out of, I obviously left office in a manner with which you may have, a manner you may have read about. I have reflected on that. And one of the things that I've learned is that I think it's absolutely critical, absolutely critical for those in politics to be able to engage better, more straightforwardly and more honestly with the public who ultimately we serve. The quality of the political discourse needs to be improved. This isn't about my particular incident, it's about everything that's happened afterwards. It is about making sure that as the reliance on the BBC in a small number of newspapers completely dissipates, that we have a high quality debate, and that we can have a constructive, rational and sensible debate in which people in a world of social media can properly discuss ideas and the policies that flow from them. I worry that that is disappearing from our national discourse, and I think that the quality of the political discourse needs to improve. There is a dance between politicians and the media. I've danced that dance, and it is brutal, and it is necessary for it to be rather prettier in the years ahead. And so I think that we all need to be able to allow our politicians to be more true to their feelings and say what they really think. And if we can do that and have a bit less of the automaton in our politicians, then we'll be better governed as a result. So there you go. That's what I had to say. I hope that we can have a debate and a discussion. I'll end on this one thing. I went into the jungle because, you know, because I basically thought, there's a couple of reasons. But the main reason is I basically thought that people knew about me from me on a screen, right? with two flags behind me, and then with the whole media, what do I call it, media storm, shit show, I think is the best description that happened to me after my resignation. It's an irony of the British system that you have to travel all the way to Australia in order to be able to engage directly with people and show who you really are, and to answer questions directly with you. without the sort of side that you get in the political discourse. But one of the things that came out of that and that's come that I've found since I've left is I have this extraordinary following amongst people who aren't normally that are interested in politics. And what I've tried to do is just show that there's sorts of people who go into politics. People like are normal people, right? This is quite an uphill struggle, it turns out, explaining that we are just normal people trying to do our best. And for any of you interested in going down this route, I warn you that holding on to the fact that you're actually a normal person is a real challenge. And ironically, it's by going on reality TV that you can demonstrate that. Anyway, there were some other reasons to go into the jungle. It was a totally bonkers experience. And Sean Walsh is a lovely guy. And with that, I will end, I will open it up to questions, and I will thank you for your engagement for coming in such huge numbers. But you've got to promise me this. What you've got to promise me is that we make sure we interrogate and we learn and that we base decisions that we make when you all go and do amazing things in the future. We base them on the thoughts that we have and the thinking that we did when we had time. and the space to do it and that's what I wanted to come and tell you tonight thank you very much
