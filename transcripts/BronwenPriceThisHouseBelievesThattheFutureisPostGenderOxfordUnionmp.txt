 So, as Kira put it, I don't often venture outside the iron grip of the West Country Society, but for everyone's sake here tonight, I'm going to give it my best shot. Audrey Lord once stated that our future survival is predicated upon our ability to relate to inequality. and when making the difficult choice between which side I would take on this debate, this phrase stuck out of my mind and landed me firmly on the opposition camp. I started at the Union both as a pretty naive fresher and also as the LGBTQIA plus rep. And whilst I am still arguably naive, to have my first proper paper speech on such an important and inclusive motion feels like a pretty, pretty full circle moment. So I thank the President for listening to me speak tonight. Tonight, I'm going to be keeping it pretty simple and be presenting you with two arguments. Luckily, I'm very nice, so I'm going to do one each of whatever side you might instinctively fall on this motion. For those who thought, yeah, maybe the future is post-gender. I can agree, it's a pretty nice idea. Unfortunately, we cannot just have a cheeky bit of gender abolitionism because a minusical subset of the left think it's a marvelous idea. That requires a remarkable societal change that we are just not ready for. as a matter of fact not theory this motion is just not realistic and secondly for you on the opposition side congratulations you're one step ahead but i would like to commit you further i'll be demonstrating that the mere disillusion of some gender roles in our future does not bring society anywhere near close enough to a trajectory where this might happen particularly because of the utility that a future society with these reduced gender roles but still an ability to have ascribed to or even avoid gender identity placed many individuals. As some of you may know, I am one of those really annoying people that does law. So the inner lawyer in me recognises the importance in properly framing the motion here tonight. The proposition may attempt to misconstrue it. They might frame the future as some hundreds of years from now, and yet to me, the reasonable person, this motion, and the reasonable person, this motion is clearly set in the immediate future. My point is, we should be looking to how the world, is going to look in a generation or two or even three. Not when the world has been fried to a crisp and politicians have finally gained a molecule of integrity. That is just not practicable. And my first point, why is it that I believe this motion is so unrealistic? Well, I would like us to all think a bit deeper about what this world would actually look like and what would have to happen to make it come to fruition. A post-gender society goes far beyond the disillusion of gender roles and stereotypes. It would erode all gender identity. There is no binary or non-binary in this world. Society has all of a sudden decided that an aspect of identity that has been around for thousands of years no longer bears any influence upon it. Any links to gender... No, any links to gender in anti-discrimination policies, legislation, art institutions, religious behaviours and media, somehow managed to completely and utterly dissipate. We cannot have some of the future being post-gender, but not religion or equality legislation or policies. I'll tell you what's more likely to happen. Society will become more progressive. We will be alleviated of many of the influence of some of our gender roles and society, as it has always done, will fluctuate in how it fused gender. If anything, our society is coming more receptive to the reality of gender and the rights of trans and non-binary people. Saying we will be disregarding gender identity in the future is an interesting idea. It's as alluring to me as never having to receive a hack message ever again. Unfortunately, neither are particularly realistic. I'm going to keep getting hacked and society is still going to find gender identity playing a role in it. Whatever form this might take. Last time we had the wonderful Malala come and speak to us in this very chamber and she has a quote which I think is particularly pertinent to this debate in that we cannot all succeed, when half of us are held back. Likewise, society cannot become post-gender until we are post-gender inequalities. Otherwise, society is becoming post-gender at a point at which those who protected gender identities are nowhere near level on the playing field of life. There is still so much progress society needs to make in this remit, so to disregard gender would be completely detrimental and contradictory to this. The proposition might tell you that gender is indefinitely bad for all of us, and yet having the ability to identify or choose not to identify of a gender identity is something that is very important for many people. The very fact of this being true, for some demonstrates that society does not and will not view gender as a blanket evil, even when sometimes in reality it is acting as such. We can and likely will still progress in regards to gender identity without many of the harms of the present. on my second point I wanted to make clear that as unlikely as emotion is it isn't always one that's unhelpful the issue here is clearly not gender in a conceptual sense but how society deals with it so to move post-gender is to avoid the actual root of the issue the current trajectory of society is one in which by increasingly by recognizing how arbitrary many of our gender distinctions are we are increasingly free to put our very existent gender identity into our own hands. This positive change and its continuation relies on our society recognizing gender. A society that still recognizes gender, despite reducing gender roles, and stereotypes has utility and meaning to many individuals. This is especially relevant for some trans and non-binary people, and I would like to use the example of a TikToker called Dylan Morveni. Dylan shot to TikTok stardom when documenting her series 100 Days of Girlhood. in particular she gained considerable media support when her body was publicly ridiculed by Caitlin Jenner Dylan perfectly expressed this sentiment regarding a surgical transition when saying there are so many trans women who don't have access to it or they don't want it and it doesn't make them any less of a woman. This sentiment demonstrates that as gender roles decline and the concepts of masculinity and femininity are less tied to one's outward appearance, our future will look like one where increasingly people can affirm their gender identity by wearing what makes them feel most comfortable. Society doesn't need to make itself post-gender to achieve the targets at the proposition of set. Post-genderism would remove both the negatives and the positives of this gender concept, which, as I have said, does not address the root of the problems here. Whereas an increasingly disregarding the toxic opinions around gender would at least have a better shot at the atrium of this issue. gender is a constant and a constraint of the past, present and future. This doesn't mean it will look or mean the same to society in the future, just as it doesn't look or mean the same now as it did in the past. Surely if we can express ourselves more in line with our own truth now, more so in the past, and this is an increasing fact, than if anything true gender identity, expression and freedom, is only going to proliferate. In summary, not only a gender role's too entrenched, but also having a concept of gender is helpful for people to be able to navigate their identity. It will be true for some that labels or the avoidance of labels is helpful to people in society to come where I've demonstrated you still can't avoid gender. Furthermore, my characterisation of the role of gender society in future, gender expression in future society, is far more realistic and is based on the long history of the conceptually intertwined concept of society and gender, and the fact that their relationship is here to stick around, albeit in a fluctuating form. Proposition have and will fail to properly demonstrate you what this motion would look like and why it is a close certainty, probably because it's not. They will ignore the evidence of a change around society and gender is not evidence that it will move completely and utterly beyond gender. Furthermore, this motion fails to distinguish between the positive and negative aspects of gender and falls utterly short of actually targeting the issues that make these distinctions so. The future may be post-gender roles, but gender identity will and should always exist. As such, don't let a rose-tinted wild view cloud your judgment. Vote to opposition. Thank you. Thank you.
