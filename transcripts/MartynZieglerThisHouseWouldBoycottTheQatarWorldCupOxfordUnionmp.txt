 Good evening, everybody, and may I say what a pleasure it is to be here in the city of dreaming spires. My name is Martin Ziegler, increasingly irrelevant. And I'm fortunate enough to be the chief sports reporter of the Times and Sunday times, and I've reported on every World Cup since the 1998 tournament in France. I think uniquely among my fellow speakers, I was actually at the Mezae Zentrum in Zurich on that fateful day in December 2010 when it was announced by the then FIFA President Set Blatter that Qatar had won the 2022 World Cup election and would follow Russia in 2018. well before Mr Blatter's official announcement, rumours swept through the Congress that England had been humiliated in the FIFA vote and that Russia and remarkably Qatar were the victors. I needed confirmation of this outcome before filing a story and which source could I ask who was carefree enough about protocol yet possessed of the salient facts? It soon came to me. And yet it was somebody who has graced this. chamber on many occasions Boris Johnson then the London mayor part of the England 2018 team Boris confirmed the results of the vote registered his disgust with a shake of his blonde mane and my first thought in relation to Qatar is there's going to be trouble ahead trouble there has certainly been and I've followed it every step of the way in the 12 years since then and reported on much of it. Firstly, the vote buying. If the Qatar 22 big committee themselves have not been party to any payment of cash for votes, there's certainly plenty of evidence to suggest that many of those FIFA fat cats who voted for the bid found themselves enriched one way or another. In 2020, the US Justice Department indictment alleged three South American FIFA members that took bribes to vote for Qatar as the World Cup hosts. without specifying who had paid those sweeteners. This was not a clean contest. Yet neither were the votes for the 1998, the 2002, the 2006, the 2010, the 2014 and the 2018 World Cups. There's evidence of the degree of corruption in votes for all of those tournaments, not to mention the 2014, 2016 and 2012 Olympics. Cash for votes for major sporting events has been the norm rather than the exception over the last 25 years, though we hope that has now come to an end. Secondly, moving the World Cup from the summer to the winter, this was never part of Qatar's original bid. Instead, they claimed they could air-condition the country to accommodate hundreds of thousands of fans. Yet there is an argument that if football is truly a sport for the whole world, it should not be constrained by the Eurocentric calendar and should be able to be played at times where it's feasible to have fans go to these parts of the world. Thirdly, there is the unavoidable fact that the World Cup is going to be played in the country which is not an electoral democracy, where birthright decides its rulers, where homosexuality is illegal and women's rights are severely curtailed. No amount of sports washing will camouflage those realities, but neither will boycotting the tournament and prove that situation. Instead, sports bodies must be pushed to ensure that human rights guarantee, are a clear requirement for hosting all international sports events. That way progress can be achieved. Fourthly, and to me, most importantly, there's the issue surrounding the human rights of the migrant workers. Following Qatar's win, the population exploded. Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from the poorer parts of Africa and Asia arrived to swell the population to 2.7 million. Now 2.1 million people, 90% of the working population, than migrants. Their conditions, treatment and sufferings have been well documented. For example, amnesty found that construction workers on one stadium worked up to seven months without pain in conditions of extreme heat and its latest report published only today says that the job of protecting migrant workers from exploitation is only half done. There is unfinished business in Qatar. All of these things that could be argued are justification for a boycott of the World Cup. in Qatar. And I might have agreed once if we were having this debate in 2012 or 2013. My argument, however, is it's far too late for a boycott now. It would achieve little, apart from some slightly self-righteous self-justification, from those who participated in a boycott. I believe it would in fact be counterproductive. It would achieve nothing for the migrant workers and the families of those who have been injured or killed working on World Cup related infrastructure. That explains why neither Amnesty International, your human rights watch, are in favour of a boycott now, and my fellow speaker, Minky Warden, will expand on that. The 32 participating countries should go to Qatar, but they should use the World Cup to shine a light on what has happened, and is happening, not just there, but in the whole of the Gulf region. Anyone who has been to Dubai will see a city built by bonded labour. The same applies Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia as much as it does in Doha. If we boycott the World Cup, we lose our influence. There's already been some meaningful change in workers' rights, but not nearly enough. Everyone connected to football, be it the players, officials, fans, media, unions, charities, rights groups, and of course, FIFA, need to use this World Cup in Qatar to secure a revolution in workers' rights in a part of the world where for decades they've been abused. This is not about FIFA or big money sponsors or oil-rich Qatar keeping the tournament because of their whole power and influence. This should be regarded as an opportunity to achieve something really positive for the workers, not just in Qatar, but across the Middle East. Because as we know, we are just at the beginning of countries in this region bidding and organising major sports events. Both Qatar and Saudi Arabia, they've even said that they want to bid for the Olympics. Compensating the families is one hugely important campaign aim, demanding that fee from the Qatari government agree to a permanent centre for workers where they can access support and advice as another, and both of these are being supported by at least seven of the countries taking part of the World Cup, including England, Wales and the United States, as well as the International Players Union. There would be an expectation on players and coaches to continue to spread that way. message throughout the tournament. Imagine what it would be like if a boycott stripped Qatar of the World Cup, with FIFA forced to choose an alternative host at short notice. No doubt many people who dislike everything about it being Qatar would regard that as a triumph, but it would leave those hundreds of thousands of workers in the lurch. What incentive would it be for the Qataris to improve their conditions to crack down on exploitative companies and bringing more positive changes to their laws on human rights if the eyes of the world are no longer fixed on them. For many reasons, the 2022 World Cup will be regarded by many as a bad dream. Let us use it to make a better life for those who have toiled to make it a reality. Thank you.
