 Well, I suppose we can start with your upbringing. So you were born and raised in a country state in Norfolk before the Second World War, as the daughter of two members of the nobility. So really that's an upbringing that doesn't exactly exist anymore. Do you have fond memories of a childhood and are there any particular memories that stand out? And particularly what were your first memories of the Princess Margaret and Queen Elizabeth? Right, well I'll start with myself, I think. Well, because when I was born I was a big disappointment because I was a girl. And in those days, well still, there's primogenitor and women cannot inherit. Although the royal family have changed it. And if Princess Charlotte was the older one, she would be queen and Prince George wouldn't be king. But the aristocracy haven't got round, so changing that. So I remember, you know, from a very early age, that I was a big disappointment. I remember saying, which is all advanced actually, for these days, I remember saying to my father, shall I have a sex change? Would that? My father said, I don't think that would help. So, my father was in a query to the Duke of York before he became king. And as a result, my sister and I met the queen, she was Princess Elizabeth then, and Princess Margaret Rose. And I suppose I was three when I first met Princess Margaret, and I just knew she was going to be a friend. She was quite naughty, and so was I. And we had these little tricycles, and we used to tricycle. I don't know if any of you been to Holcomb, it's one of the stately homes, but it's got this wonderful marble hall. And Mrs. Morgan and I, we weren't allowed to. We used to love going in there and tricely around. I remember doing that one day, and the Queen who had been playing with some other friends, came down the steps, and she looked at us, and she said, Margaret, very, very naughty, and Anne too. And we streamed with laughter and sort of raced round and out of a door. So, you know, I think that was my first memory. And then I'll just tell you a story. We were always asked to Princess Margaret's and the Queen's birthday parties and Christmas parties. And I remember going to Buckingham Palace, and we went with our nannies. In those days they wore hats and gloves, and we were all in our little white, frilly dresses, and silver shoes. And there's a story actually about silver shoes, because there was a photograph of us, Queen is looking at Princess Margaret in a rather suspicious way and I said to her, what ma'am, why are you looking at my feet? And Princess Margaret said, well you had silver shoes and I had lace up brown ones. I was so jealous. Anyway we went to Buckingham Palace which was a wonderful tea I remember and then we had a Punch and Judy show which actually Princess Margaret and I both agree we were terrified of. Mr. Ponce of beating his wife to frazzle. And then afterwards we came down where there was a big table by the front door Buckingham Palace and there were presents on them. And my sister rushed forward and got a sort teddy bear and I was just about to, I saw a doll I rather like, just about to take it. And suddenly from above I looked up and there was Queen Mary. It was quite alarming looking actually. She always wore all the old-fashioned clothes and covered in jewelry. And just as I was about to take the doll, she said, Anne, can I give you a piece of vice? Well, I didn't want a piece of vice at all. I want the doll. But anyway, she said, often, better things come in little boxes. So I had to take this little box. And in fact, she's quite right, because in it was a little necklace of pearls and coral. and my great-granddaughter, Boyt at Christmas this year, is something that, you know, we've always kept. So, anyway, that's the sort of I'm just telling us about the first time I met Princess Margaret. Well, that's quite the story. And how do you think... You press my button and off I go, I'm right? Well, she did say this before. I am going to come back to as often as I can. No, but... No, no, I'm sure you've got wonderful questions for me. And how do you think that... personality of Princess Margaret has evolved from that age of three? Well I think, I was very interesting because the Queen was six years older than her and always much taller. Princess Margaret minded frightfully being small and that's why in fact she didn't like Queen Mary all that much because every time Queen Mary saw she'd say oh Margaret I see you haven't grown and poor Princess Margaret and I think it must be very difficult because right at the beginning there's been some lovely I don't know if any of you've seen it, came out last week, I think, private film of the Queen, of her childhood and then later on. And I think that when Princess Margaret realized her sister was going to be Queen, when Uncle David gone, it was very difficult for her because the Queen had everything, you know. And I remember at, well, I go into the coronation, perhaps, a little bit of a little bit of her, a little bit because I'm a very rare creature. There are very, very few people as old as me that are alive today who were part of the coronation. In fact, there was six Maisvona, I was one of them. There was some page boys who are still alive and some choir boys and the queen, of course. So what would you like me to say next? Well, I suppose one of these questions is actually about the coronation, so I suppose if you can talk more about that, and perhaps also about how you expect the next coronation to look like. Yes, right. Well, I've always worked all my life. My mother started ceramics, a pottery business at Holcomb, partly because she didn't think that my sister and I should go and work in London, and also to provide jobs which were rather scarce in North North North. Anyway, she started this pottery, which became a huge success. At one point we employed 100 workers there. We were the largest light industry in North Norfolk. Anyway, my sister was rather, she did a lot of the painting and was artistic. I wasn't. And my job was something we probably never heard of, but it's called sponging and fetting. It was the most boring job in the world, that's all I can tell you. And I got rather sort of fed up, I think, by it. And my mother said, well, Anne, what would you like to do? And I said, well, I love selling. And so I went on the road, I was just 17. There were no other women doing this. And I used to stay in travelling salesmen hotels all around England. And they were always a bit surprised to see me. And they all actually turned out very, very nice. And in the evening, when the trolley came round with the cocoa or tea, they always turned to me and said, will you be mother? So, you know, I had a great time there. And then I went to America to sell. Didn't have great success. And while I was in America, I got a telegram. And in those days, telegrams were only sent when somebody died. And I thought, oh heavens, you know, someone who's died in the family, opened the telegram. And it said, come back, Anne, you've been asked to me a maid of honor, at the coronation. I was simply thrilled. And it got into the New York Times that I was there. And of course, wonderful. I sold dozens of Toby jugs of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. And I came back with a sort of full order book. And it was extraordinary because we, there were six of us, we were chosen, it was also snobby to say very nowadays, but we had to be daughters of dukes, marquises or earls. We had to have sort of nice figures and look okay. And we were drilled like soldiers by the Duke of Norfolk. We had lots of rehearsals and the Duchess of Norfolk stood in for the Queen. We only had one rehearsal of the Queen and that was at Buckingham Palace when she sort of tied a curtain to have ways to be to trail up and down behind her. And then the great day, well we then were fitted for our dresses and because I was brought up in the wall there were coupons. I mean none of us had any clothes. It was rationing. I mean all my childhood I was hungry I remember and cold. I mean when people complain now about certain things I say well you know you know all to see what we put up with in the wall. And so suddenly we went to Norman Hartnell, who was doing the dresses. And the silk for the queen's dress and my dress was made by silkworms in Wales. For some reason, all the silkworms happened to be in Wales. Anyway, a lot of people had saved up their coupons to give to the queen so that she should have enough for her dress. And the same thing happened to the six of us. We were given a lot of coupons. And they were the most beautiful dresses. I was very heavily embroidered, and very embroidered down the back, because we were seen from the back. So anyway, the great day arrived. And my mother had been chosen and asked to be a lady in waiting to the queen. So we were both staying for the night in my uncle's flat in London. Because the whole of London was absolutely full. You couldn't get a, you know, anywhere. And Jack Cook said, well, you can have my flat. The only trouble is, he's only got one bedroom. So my mother obviously had the bed, and I had a mattress on the floor, so I didn't sleep at work much. And it was pouring with rain, and I remember waking up and seeing our dresses so hanging. And I thought, you know, today I'm going to wear this, at this amazing occasion. And then four of us were driven to the Abbey. And as we drove, I mean, people were shouting, they've been there all night, soaking wet, and they kept on saying, Hillary, Hillary! And I thought, what on earth are they shouting? And of course, Hillary had reached the top of Mount Everest that morning. I don't quite know where he'd been the night before, whether he'd been in a small tent waiting for the moment. But anyway, it was very, very exciting that he'd reached the top of Mount Everest. And then we arrived at the Abbey, and four of us, two of us, two, to go. two of the grandest, mates of honour, were in a coach behind the queen. We were at the door and suddenly we had our coming and we could hear this roar of people and nearer and nearer and then round the corner came this golden coach which of course we all saw the other day at the Jubilee that they had it in the procession and we hadn't seen, nobody had seen her in her dress and two pages opened the door. and we looked at her and she was wonderful. She was 26. She was so beautiful, wonderful skin and eyes and all this amazing jewelry. And her dress was embroidered with all the symbols of Great Britain and the Commonwealth. People said, did she say anything to at that moment? Well, she didn't. We got her out of the coat. And the train rippled over her hands and the great thing about it. about that coronation day was everywhere the queen went, we had to go, we were sort of attached to her room. We went in and she stood there waiting. The Duke of Norfolk had thought of everything and put a tiny little piece of cotton on the carpet so she knew exactly where to stand and she had our back to us and we were standing there and then she just looked round, she looked suddenly around and she said ready girls and off we went to Nimrod and it was Incredible. People say, but how do they get so many people in Westminster Abbey? Well, they built the whole thing, I mean, much, much higher than this, right up to the ceiling. And as we came in, all the members of the Commonwealth, representing the Commonwealth, were in the choir stalls, and they were all in their national dress looking amazing. Then you had all the peeresses and the peers, and to me, it looked like a sort of medieval tapestry. And then the queen you see originally at the beginning hadn't wanted, didn't want it to be televised or photoculars. She said it was a holy occasion that she didn't want the cameras. But Winston Churchill said that, you know, because of the Commonwealth and because of the television, it was a, you would have laughed because you're all much much younger with me here. The televisions were this size, they were like postage standards. stamps and sort of grey and white. There was only one program every night. We used to sit waiting. There was a sort of card on it. And we all sat for hours waiting. And anyway, Churchill said, no, because of the Commonwealth, it must be televised. So the lights were very, very strong, and we were all made up very strongly, because otherwise the lights bleached the colour out of one. And the only moment of the coronation which was the most moving of all was the anointing. The cameras were switched off. All her regalia was taken from her, the orb and sceptre and everything was taken from her. And she was dressed in a little, it was a little white cotton gown actually. And the Marcus of Chambly, who was the most beautiful looking man, was meant to do it up at the back. back. Well, he'd never dressed anybody else, let alone himself, I don't think. And he simply couldn't do it. The Duke of Norfolk got more, more irritated, and said, you know, hook. And in the end, he said, well, I can see we can't have hooks and eyes. Well, I have to have press studs. So this is what happened, because I could see the queen doing this every time. And afterwards, I said to her, ma'am, was that all right? And she said, no, it was not all right. She said, It was very, very uncomfortable, and he pressed very hard. Anyway, there she was, dressed in this beautiful, and then they anointed her, and they put a canopy over her. And as a maid of honour, six maids of honour, we were standing, and we and the bishops, and I think the Duke of Edinburgh, the only people actually saw her anointed. And that was the religious kernel of the whole thing. And when people say, will she abdicate for Prince Charles or anything, she won't, unless something really awful happens to her, because she gave her word, her oath to the Commonwealth, to Great Britain, that she would, you know, do everything in her power as queen to be a proper queen. And I think, I don't know if you agree, but I think she was absolutely fantastic. Anyway, we then went behind the rude screen where her train was changed. She then came down with another train, slightly lighter actually. And I watch the films now, although I know it's going to be all right, I always think, how are we going to trip? Oh, because he had to come down steps much longer than this, like those, without looking, we weren't allowed to look, and we just had to feel the steps, you know? Anyway, it all went fine. We then had lunch in the, there was a sort of place down below. No guess is what we had. We had coronation chicken. And I think she had fish actually. She had soul. And then off she went in her coach to go back to Bucking Palace. And four of us went straight to Bucking Palace. Well, we were so lucky because we saw Churchill coming. We saw the amazing Queen of Tom. Queen of Tonga who had refused to put down, it's pouring the cover of her thing. So she's absolutely safe in West. When she came out, she sort of shook herself like a dog. I remember the Queen looking sort of amazed by this huge, huge ladies sort of shaking all the rain off her. And then the Queen took her crown off when we got in and put it on a table and then she thanked us. She said, you know, thank you so much for, you know, it's been incredible. nothing went wrong. And Prince Charles made beeline for the crown. And I think it's my mother who got it away from him, because he thought it's too awful if he dropped it, you know, bad omen. Anyway, and they were having a lovely time, Princess Anne, and they were under her train, they were sort of, and she was just laughing and, you know, it was so lovely. And then we all went along the passage, and she sort of ran in a way. And long afterwards I saw a private film that she had made of various things. And there was she looking happy and us, and the Queen Mother looking wonderful, she always did, and the Duke of Edinburgh, and then behind them, Princess Margaret, looking rarely sad. And I said to her, I've seen this film, ma'am, you look so sad. And she said, yes, of course I was. And I lost my beloved father, they were very close, and I really lost my sister, because she's going to be so busy. And I've got to go and live with my mother, which I suppose, you know, it was difficult as her age. But anyway, then the only other thing, I suppose, that was fantastic at the coronation, is coming out on the balcony. And of course, we obviously came with her because we were with the train. And I think because we'd been through the war, we'd won the war, this was a wonderful, beautiful, you know, a new Elizabethan queen. And the crowds, well, they always are, I saw the other day, but they were all people in their army or naval air force dress. It was rather not a colourful crowd. And of course they chaired and chairs. And every time she tried to go in, they wouldn't let her, you know, they said, oh no, you know, we turned back and all that. And then my life, in the evening, I got afraid And I went down in front of the balcony. I thought earlier on the day I was on the balcony with her. And now I'm shouting and waving and you know. She came out after dinner, I think two or three times. But I says it was one of the most wonderful and extraordinary moments days of my life. And I'm so, so lucky to have been part of it. And I'm now very like I read a book when I was, 87, I'm going to be 90 next month. And I thought, well, I can't possibly write a book. Anyway, I did and I don't know if any of you read it, but it was great success. And one of the things I think that people like, and I have had letters from eminent people saying that it's a so key home, that I was actually there, and I'm the only person to have written about the coronation that was part of it. And I think that, because they may go on to things like the crowd in a minute, might be not. And, you know, in comparison, I was there. This is absolutely true what I wrote. Well, I mean, that's certainly quite the story. I'm not saying you'll get a word in edge with. No, no, it's perfectly fun. I mean, you are a figure of history, and I think it'd be great to hear more about the coronation. You mentioned in your remarks about how her magicians. to see the Queen actually swore an oath to the Commonwealth. And she did so, I think, on a colonial tour, when she was still the Princess Elizabeth. You know, obviously since her coronation, the UK seen quite a bit, she's seen quite a bit, decolonization, complete changes to society, certainly lots of trials and tribulations. So what do you think drives the Queen to go through these 70 years of service? Well, I think, I mean, I remember as a child, she was very calm the Queen. She accepts things. And I think one of the reasons that rarely affected her was Uncle David. Well, she adored her Uncle David, the Prince of Wales. And there was a very charming again the other day. There was sort of home movies of her and Uncle David. And he was playing with them. They seemed so fond of each other. And I think it was the most appalling blow when he gave everything up and abdicated. which meant that her beloved father who had this really bad stutter, and he found it very, very difficult to communicate, because my father was his little query. The amount of times my father was fishing the waste paper basket, that had been kicked. I mean, the trouble was that he had a difficult temper in a way, only because he couldn't express himself. And I think the queen, at a very early age, realized, you know, In fact, Uncle David abdicating was the reason her father died so early. And I think even as a small girl after Uncle David had gone, she just swore to herself, if I am queen, when I become queen, I'm never going to behave like that. And I will give my life, which she has done, you know, to the country and the Commonwealth. Well, I mean, it's certainly quite a remarkable story as we celebrate 70 years of her service to the crown. Could you talk perhaps more about your relationship to Her Royal Highness, the Countess of Snowden, better known as Princess Margaret, namely because you served as a lady in waiting for 31 years? Could you just talk about that and what has been around? Yes, I would say quite often the royal family, when they see a friend having a bit of a difficult time, perhaps with their husbands, They often, quite often ask them, for instance, Diana, Princess Wales's grandmother, was a lady waiting to the Queen Mother because her husband, Jack Spencer, was really, very difficult. And my husband wasn't easy, but the trouble was that when my daughter says, I've got, the The trouble was that when I was asked to be a lady-in-waiting, Colleen thought he could come too. And I said, well, that's not the point. I'm afraid you can't, you know. But there were occasions, and I will tell you, you might not think it funny about, but there was an occasion when he had come with us. And of course, Princess Margaret, when you're a lady-in-waiting, the job of a lady-in-waiting is just to be there, to make it easy, to be a go-between, really. people come to you and say, you know, Princess Mara like this or that. And the first time I ever went abroad with her was to Australia. And it was just when our marriage was going not very, going more the world. And the press there, the media, they were really difficult and shouting at her. Where's Tony and all this sort of thing? And she got quite upset. So I said to her private secretary, do you think, you were traveling by train, Do you think if we had a cocktail party on the train and asked the media and she could meet them informally? And Mrs Margaret Act, she's very good with men. She liked men. Well, it was a huge success. They came, she talked to them all. They thought she was wonderful. We had no more trouble there. But when we got to Sydney, they wanted her to go on Bondi Beach. And she said, and I can't, Anne, I hate sand in my shoes. So they came to me and said, do you think, Lady. and Conner, you could persuade her. So I said, well, I'll try. I'm not going to promise anything. But I went up to her maid and said, could I have a flat pair of Princess Margaret's shoes that I put in my bag? And as we got near Bondi Beach, she was going to view it from afar. I said to her, ma'am, you know, they really want it. It's all like kissing the blarney stone, you know, they really would love you to go on the beach. So she said, oh, I can't, Anne, you know, my shoes. So I said, well, actually, ma'am, I have got a flat pair. And she looked at me, she said, okay, Anne, you win this time. You know, we had a very nice sort of relationship like that. And then I remember being at the races in Australia and it's pouring with rain, and her shoes absolutely soaked. So she gave them to me and said, can you get somebody to drive them? And while we have lunch. And I went back to the lady's room to fetch them and they were unrecognisable. And I said to the lady in charge, you know, what's happened to them? She said I put them in the microwave. And so they were completely. Anyway, she had to wear them because we didn't have any other shoes. She hobbled around, glaring at me. But the thing about her was that as a lady in waiting, you do a lot of letters and organizing. And, you know, you always had to find out where the lavatory is, and they ask what she'd like to drink. But in the evenings, when, you know, all that's over, I used to go to her sitting there, when we used to talk about, you know, who she'd met, what she'd done, what she thought, laugh a bit, you know, and relax. And so that's really what a lady-in-waiting does. All right. Well, let's perhaps then broaden this about perhaps other royal experiences. So, of course, you served for many years as a part of the royal household and the monarchy. So how do you think the functioning of the world household has changed over the past 70 years? Will it survive? How should it survive? And what do you think are the biggest threats to it? When you talk about household, you see there are several households. And that, I think, is the problem slightly. There's Buckingham Palace House House. Prince Charles has a household. Prince Andrew had a household. You know, and they all vie slightly with each other. Actually, Princess Margaret's household, we were all very, very friendly. and got on very well. Princess Margaret was really good with everybody who worked for her. And her staff stayed with her dresses, people who look after our clothes and her. I've always stayed with her. I think that things are changing, obviously now. The Queen isn't, can't do so much, you know. and Prince Charles is obviously been given much more to do. I think Prince Charles will have, I think, it's interesting, I'm very fond of Prince Charles. He's a great friend of mine. I've known him since he's a little boy. He used to come to Holcomb. If he ever had mumps or measles or anything like that, because the Queen never been to boarding, he's never been to school. And so in order to protect her, Prince Charles used to be sent up. mother used to look after him so I've known him you know I'm really fond of him and so much of what he said about the environment and all that sort of thing has come true people used to laugh at him you know but he is outspoken and of course when you when he becomes king and this is what the Queen has been so brilliant at she has always kept our own personal thoughts to herself Prince Charles will have I think to quickly learn this you know he knows but he finds it so difficult. Having always spoken his mind suddenly he will not be able to. People sometimes say what about Prince William, why doesn't Prince William become king? Well I don't think I think the queen would want, Prince Charles has waited long enough and I think that he will be a very good king. He works terribly hard Prince Charles and he's, you know, all his charities have been amazing actually. I mean he does so much good work. Well, I think I'm on the topic of Prince Charles, I suppose I'll move on to the dreaded question. I may not answer it. What's he going to be? No. So I'm going to talk about the public perception of the royal family. So in recent years, I'm sure we're familiar. There's been the TV show The Crown, which of course, it's this question. I've heard you dang done another alleyway. I'll talk about the Crown. Yeah, but it very much has played, I think, an outsized role in how people have seen seeing the world family. So from your experience and from your opinion, how do you think the media has represented the royal family and what do you think are the consequences of that? I saw the very first, I don't know if you did too, and I thought it was rather good. Where we had, the ways of all I had a private showing because it was about the coronation the first thing. But then I think it's gone completely off-piced and it's sort of ridiculous because I was in it for a very short time. They filmed the moment when we introduced Princess Margaret to Roddy Llewellyn. And I hope they might do it at our family home in Scotland, but anyway they couldn't do that. And so they did it in a sort of awful, seedy-looking sort of country club. And Princess Margaret and I are dressed in bikinis and I'm pimping for her. I'm saying, ma'am, do you like that young man over there? It's got a sort of cute bottom. Well I mean, of course nothing like that happened. I mean, completely mad. But people in America think it's true and that's the trouble and I think that they should have a warning like books or something nowadays have to have warnings saying that you know there's a lot most of it is completely made up and they're really really difficult about with Prince Charles I've really sorry the way they depict him one or two things were very good Claire foy as brilliant as a queen I thought but on the whole it's not it's not it's not it's It's just not true. And how do you think the royal family can't perhaps respond to how the media is shaping their image? Well, they can't. I mean, they don't watch it to begin with. I mean, there's no point them watching it because it would upset them. I mean, I don't watch it either because it upsets me so much. They can't really. I mean, the Queen has had the most marvelous press, actually, for the Jubilee. I mean, wonderful things have been written about her quite rightly. And she has sort of remained above, although she's had to try and deal with all the difficult things that have happened recently but I've got great hope I live quite near Prince William and the Kate the Cambridge and they're great she is extraordinary it's wonderful and I think there are a real safe pair of hands and you won't perhaps talk about the ones who've gone to America well well I mean I was sad because they were greeted at the wedding and was so wonderful everybody if so pleased. I mean they couldn't have had a more lovely wedding. But of course it's not, being a member of the royal family isn't that. It's not a soap opera. It's not, you know, it's jolly hard work actually. And if you think you're going to, you know, drive around to the coach and just be sort of, have a wonderful time. And I think she just realized that it wasn't going to be like that. And being a film actress, I think she just wanted to be. to go back to something she knew. Well, I suppose we can move on to what you have done with respect to depicting the world families. You said one of the reasons that you wrote your book was you thought there were some horrible things that were said about. Yes, I did. I rarely minded some of the books that were written about Princess Margaret. It was a horrible one called Mamd Darling, completely made up. They said she'd seek to be married to Salvador, or Dali. I mean, honestly. And those sort of things were completely not true at all. And I thought I'd like to put the record straight because she was a really wonderful friend to me. And when my second son got AIDS in the 80s, everybody's really, really frightened. We didn't know how it was called. He had married and had a little son and then he decided that he wanted to come out. And anyway, I said, look, you've got to be very careful, because we don't know how this is called. He wasn't careful enough. And But Princess Margaret was wonderful. She used to come to me, there's a place in London called the Lighthouse, where all the young men, because there were so many young men, their partners had died, their parents wouldn't have anything to do with them, and they lived there. And unlike Diana, who came with the sort of positive photographers, nobody knew Princess Margaret came, and long before Diana. And she wasn't sort of touchy-feely, but she used to sit in our room, she'd joke with them, and they'd laugh. And she's always ringing me up and saying, you know, she'd heard something that might be a cure. She always brought her children, David and Sarah, to stay with me. A lot of my friends suddenly didn't. I mean, I didn't blame them because, you know. And whenever she saw Henry, she hugged him. She came to his funeral, and she was just a really good friend. And with my other children, my eldest son was a drug, He actually did get married and I got a wonderful grandson who's now he's a bank and a lawyer and he's about to get married. Charlie would have been so surprised if he'd known. So, you know, and Princess Margaret all the way through my life was a really good friend. So when she was ill, she couldn't, she went blind, you know, at the end for about two years. years and one or two, Beth said she rather touchingly because she was loved men and she said good with men but when she became ill she didn't look too good and so she said to me and I'm afraid I'm giving up men now she said but I'd love to see all my my girlfriends women friends and I used to go and read to her and I remember arriving one day I was she said I'm quite excited I've got this book on seeds. So my heart sank. I thought, God. So anyway, off I started, got as far as potatoes, I think. And I said, are you enjoying this man? Are you sure? Yes, she said, Roddy gave it to me. Carry on. So off I carried on, you know. But, you know, I miss her even now. She was very extraordinary, because when you asked her a question, I often said, rang her up, especially when the boys were ill because Christopher, my third son, had his motorbike accident in Belize, was in a coma for five months, and she's wonderful there. But she often, her advice came from a different way, not the way that one expected, or what other people might say. She's a very clever, Princess Margaret. I mean, she's a love coming here to Oxford, and we used to go around all the colleges, and Cambridge, and she's very interested in the church. I used to hear her putting some of the bishops were amazed by her, you know, her questions. I mean, I think she would have loved to have come to university because you see, in our day, my day, there's no question of one coming to university. You expected to marry, her husband. And, you know, we were, in fact, girls were not educated in my day at all, really. And And the Queen was because Queen Mary said to Queen Elizabeth, because Queen Elizabeth just wanted them to have fun, you know, and all that sort of thing. And Queen Mary said, no, they've got to be educated properly, especially Princess Elizabeth. And so Princess Elizabeth had people from Oxford that came and taught her in Cambridge and Eaton, and she's very well educated, the Queen. But Princess Margaret was furious because she wasn't. We had a French governess and Crawfey, which is a governor. But I'm sure that if, in our days, I'm sure Princess Margaret would have loved to have come to university like, all you lucky people here. All right. Well, you actually mentioned Princess Diana, and there has been quite a bit of discussion about how people like Princess Diana, but also the one who went to America, the Duchess of Sussex, have kind of leaned into... Well, I'm not going to talk about you. Yeah. Have leaned into celebrity cultural. So do you think there has been an amalgamation of the royal with a celebrity? Yes, I think, well, they, I mean, because Diana, I knew as a child, Diana, she used to go to my sisters at a little school, a little preschool. I've always known her. And of course, I mean, she's brought up, Diana, on sounding a state with the royal family. And when you get these ridiculous things again in the crown, or one of those things, where Princess Morgan has to teach her, to curtsy well I mean that's ridiculous she I mean she's brought up with them you know but of course what she did which was unexpected I mean she just took the world by storm I mean she was she was great she was beautiful looking she had this wonderful way with people especially people who are not well and I think that it's quite difficult for Prince Charles because they always have to shout for her and be very disappointed because they the royal couples like William and Kate, you do each side of the crowd, you see. And of course, Diana, Prince Charles was this side, and they were all shouting, come over here. And I think that was very difficult because he wasn't used to that, you know. And also he was much older than her. And I mean, she's so young. She was only 19. And he told him I just one little story, not too indiscreet, but I was talking about his honeymoon, actually. And he said they were going on the Britannia. And he said, you see, the thing was, I had a pile of books I wanted to read. And I couldn't understand it, because Diana spent the whole time with the crew. Well, you know, I didn't say, well, maybe she would have wanted, you know, she's so young, she wanted a bit of fun. But I think that, but I mean, the great good thing was they had two lovely boys. And then it just didn't go. It just wasn't meant, I don't think, really. Which is sad. Well, yeah, I mean, it's, I guess, opposed to many people a great tragedy. Of course, this year marks the 70th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. I'm going to ask you about her legacies. It's next year. The next year. Okay, yeah, 1953. That's right. Because people always think it's the anniversary of coronation this year. It isn't. It's next year. But the reason was that when she became queen, Churchill said, We cannot have the coronation too soon, you know, because of rationing and, you know, you've got to have one more year to try and get the whole thing together. So in fact, it's next year that we celebrate the coronation. Yes, well, I suppose her ascension to the throne would be the accurate description here. I do apologize for this. No, no, no. I didn't want to catch you out like that. Well, I'm a rude fashion. Look, this weird educational institution, it's good to know the facts. I believe the coronation was in fact in 1953. I did, that was a small oversight from me. me. But I suppose 70 years from now, how do you think Queen Elizabeth will be remembered? Well, I think she'll be remembered in a very good way. People are already starting to sort of talk. She's extraordinary because, well, partly because of the length, I suppose. I mean, most of us, including she's always been there. She's always been Queen. I mean, what we're all going to do slightly when she goes? You know, really, really sad. And she has been amazing. I mean, You know, she has never really put a foot wrong, even when the moment, you know, when she didn't come down to London after Diana died, the reason, which I think was a very good reason, she said, I must stay with my grandchildren. I mean, they need me. Perhaps everybody else needs me, but I was, you know, and she stayed up there for a few days, and then eventually did come down when she made that very touching speech. I think she'll be remembered as one of the really great monarchs of Great Britain. And the same question about Princess Margaret. How will she be remembered? Well, in a rather different way. I mean, one of the nice things, one of the unexpected things of writing my book, all the wonderful letters I get from people. I get them from people who've lost children for various reasons. I get people right who've got difficult husbands, difficult wives. And the other very encouraging letters, people write and said, we never bothered with Princess Margaret, really. But since your book, we've seen in a completely different light. And so I'm really, really pleased about that. I've able to make, at least put my feelings about her, which wouldn't have, I don't think anybody else, would have written like that about her. And I was a bit worried, of course, after I'd written my book, and felt I couldn't send one to the Queen. I wasn't quite sure. So I knew Princess, Prince Charles liked her. Anyway, I heard the other day from Fergie, who, Prince Andrew's ex-wife, that the Queen was talking about me. So I thought, oh my God, what she said, oh, Foggic said, no, no, she's talking about your book, saying how much she enjoyed, how much it made her love. So I then sent her a sign copy. saying I'm so glad Mamma I hear you like my book. And before I hand you over to a few audience questions, this is a question that we, I think, asked every single speaker that have come this term. What advice would you give to the members of the Oxford Union? To the members of the Oxford Union. So to the audience members here. What advice? What to students? Yes, to the students of Oxford. Well, I don't know. I mean, one gets very confused, I do, when I read about snowflakes and, you know, all these wonderful books, ones who have to have warnings in them and all that sort of thing. Perhaps it's not true. I don't know whether it's true. I'm sure you're all very stored here. But I do think that people should sort of, you know, I know a stiff upper lip is not very popular nowadays. But I think a bit more backbone. I really do. And, you know, people seem to complain about everything. So, you know, very small things. And I think that now people have so much. I mean, when I was young, well, it was a war, but, you know, it was really, really difficult. You know, I mean, there was, as for heating, there was no heating at all. My bedroom in the winter was, had ice on the inside, and I used to put my clothes at the bottom of the bed, you know, and dressed in the bed and all that. I mean, you know, we all did that. And I just think people perhaps have too much nowadays. There's so much of things to do and things they want. they want and do you think I'm right in a way I think that people you're not at all sure I could say well I think people should be a bit you know bit tougher that's my thing but then I'm going to be 90 next month so perhaps that's just coming from me well I certainly think that is a perspective that's worth considering for everybody I think it's time to open it up to the audience are there any questions. I'm sure there are a few. Perhaps that's nobody wants to. They probably had enough from me. No, well, if there's not. Anyway, your lovely audience, thank you very much for coming. I've been really nice speaking to. Actually, question to the lady. I'd like to know what's your microphone please. Thank you. Yeah. Can you repeat it for me in case I call you? Sorry. Hello, Lady Glen Connor. I'd like to know what is your favorite place on the Holcomb estate? Your favorite place? on the Holcomb estate. Your favorite place on the what estate? Holcomb. Favorite place at Holcomb, Hulcombe? Oh, favorite place. Well, that's sort of easy, really, in a way. It's the beach. I had so many happy times on the beach, you know. And when I was young, wonderful picnics. And we used to camp there. And all the birds on the marshes, you know. But I used to love, my father loved wildland. wildlife and birds and we used to get into the hide we had a hide and I remember it's frightfully exciting when we heard the bitten booming you know we suddenly heard it I think I suppose an inside I suppose at Holcomb the marble hall I used to have such fun in the marble hall it's got so many memories I was I was held there by my father grandfather and great-grandfather all the looking furious at me for being a girl and then I came out there in my dress I because again there were no coupons I think and somebody from the American air a drone gave my mother a parachute which we died in the cut so I so came out in those days that was girls being presented really in a parachute dress and then I stood there in my wedding dress so I think the marble hall inside and the beach outside very well question over there If you... If you... Wait a time... Oh, can you come? Because I... Being 90, my hearing, isn't... No, as quiet as it was... If you'd had the opportunity when you were younger to go to university, what would you have studied? Oh, I think history. If I... I don't... I wouldn't have been clever enough, I don't think, to come to university. I would have loved to, you know, have the chance. Yes, I would have read history. Yes. Very well. Any further questions? Oh, lovely gentlemen down there's asking you. Thank you so much. Could I ask you? Could I ask one person who you didn't mention as much was Prince Philip? Do you have any memories or recollections of him that... Of Prince Philip? Well, I'll tell you, I mean, we, as Maison, we all fell in love, with Prince Philip at the coronation. He was so handsome, but a little bit fussy. He wanted to make it all, you know, I think to make the day for her perfect. There was one incident he'd wanted Baron, who was his great friend, to take the photographs, and Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mother, said, no, no, no, we've got to have Cecil Beaton. And I remember we were all lined up, you've probably seen the photograph, and the Duke of Edinburgh was being quite sort of fussy with us and making us stand, And Cecil beaten got more irritated. He suddenly put the camera down, looked at Prince Philip and said, do you want to take the photograph, sir? So Prince Philip, and Queen looked absolutely horrified. He did shuffle off, we didn't see him. But the other story was when they came, the Queen and Prince Philip came to Mustique, the island of my husband. We didn't have time to speak about that. And they came to see Princess Margaret's house, because we gave a plot of land for her. for her wedding present. And she, with the help of Colin, had built her house. It was the only thing she owned. And the Queen of Prince Philip were doing a tour of the Caribbean and came ashore. And Colin's mother, who was very eccentric, we asked her to go and get buy some clothes in England for the people in the village, because we couldn't get anything. Anyway, she arrived with all these boxes, and we actually thrilled and opened them. She bought a job lot of Victorian clothes. So we had to say to the first, people in the village. This is what you wear when the Queen comes. It's the wrong rain, I'm afraid, but anyway. And the Queen looked at all these people as she came up and she turned to Princess Margaret at the top and she said, Margaret, I had no idea Mustick was in a Victorian time walk. So Mrs Margaret said, well it's not actually, it's Colin's mother who bought. Anyway, the Duke of Edinburgh, when he landed, he looked round and he was inclined to say this, he said to Colin, I can see you, ruined this island. Poor Colleen was very douched. So I said slightly, which was true, but he didn't rather. I said, well, sir, we've got a great treat for you. We've arranged for you to swim with sharks. And being Prince Philip, of course, he took that absolutely. Well, in fact, it was a very rare thing that happened in one of the bays, the mother sharks come in to give birth and something actually enjoyed. And when he left, he said to Colin, I think your island's great. I mean, he's wonderful with the Queen, you know. He was always, he made her laugh a lot. The Queen's actually very funny. The Queen's got a marvellous sense of humour. I've got a photograph of her with a bucket on her head, actually. Well, somebody sort of made a joke of some sort. And she said, I don't want to hear another joke and just took this bucket and just put it like that. And I have my camera. I didn't know where she'd realized I'd take in a photo. But the Duke of Edinburgh, I think, she, she is missing a lot. He was, and he would, he was so good when all, all the difficulty with the children and all that. So he was a great mainstay. I mean, she fell in love with him when she was 12, I think. And the only person she'd ever loved, which is rather touching. Well, I believe this is all the time we have. So ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking the Lady Glenn Connor. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
