 Honourable Members of the Oxford Union, dear members of Oxford Union, dear members and guests of Oxford's distinguished academic community, ladies and gentlemen, it is hard not to feel the weight of history walking into this debating chamber. Over the years, the Oxford Union has emerged as one of the world's most significant town squares. Given its centuries old history and prestige, this is of course as it should be. In our world of fragmented public spheres and virtual eco-chambers, global public forums like this one are more important than ever. By protecting and fostering this institution, you are doing a service to all of us. So thank you for keeping your venerable tradition alive and thank you for having me today. I'm deeply honored by your invitation. I've been invited to speak to you as a politician of the Democratic left and as a prime minister of the Republic of Kosovo, Europe's youngest state. Each of these identities considers separately, brings plenty of change. challenges of its own. To be a leftist leader anywhere in the world today, even in a well-established and rich countries, is already difficult enough. Moreover, to be a Kosovovar Prime Minister, regardless of one's ethical political convictions, is not an easy task either. One can therefore imagine what happens when these two identities get combined as they happen to do in my own person. The hardships compound rather quickly. I want to focus here on two key challenges that a transformative social democratic agenda faces in a country like Kosovo, namely, a hostile geopolitical environment, and second, a fragile state capacity. I will say a few words on the nature of these two challenges and briefly discuss how our political party, the movement for self-determination has dealt with them in the past and how my government is trying to address them today. There may be some broader lessons here for the democratic left in general, especially in these troubled times of widespread democratic backsliding and since February 24 of this year the return of war to our continent. The Balkans is known as a proverbial powder keg of Europe, a famous This remark often attributed to one of your most emblematic prime ministers, Sir Winston Churchill, says that the Balkans produces more history that it can consume. Admittedly, such a comment is not without its heavy dose of Eurocentric cultural supremacy. As is well known, the Balkans has traditionally served as kind of internal orient to Europe, a peninsula at the southeastern periphery of the continent, inhabited by semi-barbaric peoples with strange backward customs prone to irrational ethnic conflicts. Furthermore, the depiction of the Balkans as the powder keg of Europe tends to obscure another crucial fact, namely that such a powder keg was rarely just of our own doing. European great powers have rarely been innocent bystanders to Balkan affairs. Be that as it may, the grain of truth contained in Churchill's remark is that geopolitics tends to be brutal in our part of the world. For most of its history, the Balkans has been at the crossroads of geopolitical battle lines, a kind of borderland where Western and Eastern empires have bitterly clashed with one another. In modern history, such brutality has been particularly felt on the backs of Albanians in general and Kosovo- Albanians in particular. For most of the 20th century, the fate that awaited the Kosovo-Albanian activists, demanding civil and political rights for his people was either assassination or life in prison. Though Albanians made only about 13% of Yugoslavia's population, they represented 80% of its political prisoners. Adam Democci, one of the most political prisoners in Europe and beyond, spent 28 years in jail. This fact should give pause to many distinguished members of the international left, who to this day view communist Yugoslavia as an idyllic socialist heaven, or as some of them put it in a letter to Tito in 1974, a respected member of the family of progressive and peace-loving nations. A hostile geopolitical environment tends to take a heavy toll on the progressive political imagination. Serbian leftist progressive voices calling for the recognition of the right to sub-determination of the Albanian people have traditionally been like voices, crying in the wilderness. The early 20th century social democrat, Dimitriy Tutsovic, condemned Serbia's imperialist policies toward the Albanian people and called them Belgrade to recognize their right to self-determination. Even though quite marginal in Serbian politics, social democratic voices such as that of Tutsovic or progressive liberal ones such as that of 19th century Western educated Milan Pirochanats have been very precious indeed. indeed. Unfortunately today they have virtually no political hairs in Serbia's political scene. However, until such politicians grow more numerous and influential in Serbian political life, it is hard to see how there can be a just and lost and long-lasting peace between our two countries. Serbia's current president refuses to acknowledge that the Rechak massacre of 15th of January 1999, took place, let alone apologize for it. Furthermore, he won't even agree to sign an unaggression pact between our two countries, something I proposed to him a year ago as a very first step towards the building of good faith. While a progressive shift in Serbian politics is something only the Serbian people can bring about, there are ways we can help it from the outside. As Kosovo's Prime Minister, I can help such a shift by proving that our republic can thrive in spite of Serbia's non-recognition of our independence. A strong and prospering Kosovo will help the Serbian people and their political elite understand that a policy of friendship towards us serves their interests much better. That's why my government is focusing on developing our economy, reforming our justice system, and strengthening our defensive capacities. To be sure, I remain committed to the EU-facilitated dialogue with Serbia's current leadership. Recognition by Serbia is always welcome, and the sooner it comes, the better for all of us in the Western Balkans. But the Republic of Kosovo can certainly live and thrive even without it. On the other hand, Western countries should also do their part in helping social and liberal democratic forces in Serbian politics and civil citizens. society. In this respect, it seems to me that in the last few decades, the Western strategy has been somewhat misguided. Though Western support that helped overthrow Milosevic back in October 2000 is rightly hailed as a success story from the viewpoint of long-term Western strategy, it has been more of a curse than a blessing. That's because it has encouraged Western allies of progressive Serbian forces to focus their help on short-term, short-term project-based initiatives. I believe this short-term perspective should be abandoned in favor of a more sustainable, long-term approach centered on values rather than projects. When we found the movement for Southmination back in June of 2005, Kosovo was still an allegedly undefined territory run for the most part by an unaccountable international administration, the so-called United Nations mission in Kosovo, otherwise known as UNMIC. And I say for the most part, for a good reason, the northern part, the northernmost part of the territory was illegally run by Serbia's parallel structures. Following the end of the war, those structures had maintained their grip on the northern tip of the country thanks to the brutal ethnic cleansing of Albanians and some other non-Serbs from the city of Mitrovica and its surroundings. In this context, the international community was telling the people of Kosovo that to earn their right to a final settlement of their political status, they had to first fulfill certain standards. Like colonial masters of old, they were telling us that we were not ripe for freedom just yet. This international approach was formulically expressed as standards before the status. Besides, they would tell us that the final political status of our country had to be negotiated with Serbia, a state with a proven track record of horrendous crimes against Kosovo-I Albanians, and one against which we had recently fought a just liberation war. In these prevailing circumstances, founding a social democratic and anti-colonial grassroots movement was to speak with Agbal Ahmal words like, sowing seeds during a storm. As he put it, occasionally they yield something, often they do not. The articulation of a social democratic and anti-colonial critique of the Kosovoar status quo of the time pitted us against three powerful actors and interests all at once. First and foremost, an unrepenting Serbian imperialism centered in Belgrade and still harboring genocidal intentions against us. Second, an unaccountable international administration running Kosovo in a neo-colonial fashion. And third, a meopic and often corrupt Kosovo political class in Pristina, whose main goal was its own political survival through harmful deals with these two de facto centers of power. Serbia's position in negotiations for Kosovo's final status was encapsulated in a formula something more than autonomy, but less than independence. On the other hand, the Kosovo political elites formula for the final status was definitely more than autonomy and nothing less than independence. Faced with these two contending formulas, the international community's compromise solution was going in the direction of supervised independence with greatly reduced autonomy. To all three formulas, we counterposed our own phrase, namely no negotiations of determination. In other words, we demanded that the people of Kosovo decide their own political fate through the democratic mechanism of the referendum. Notwithstanding their disagreements, all three negotiating parties were united in infusing the solution. The political perspective opened up by our critical intervention revealed their disagreements for what they were, minor at best, falls at worse. Our critical intervention in the Kosovo's political reality of the time could be considered a populist one. Indeed, this label was often pejoratively thrown at us by political adversaries and media commentators. Yet, it's important to emphasize that our populist trait was democratic and inclusive, not an exclusive one based on blood and soil. From the very beginning, we made clear that our struggle was not directed against Kosovo, Serbs, or any other minorities for that matter. To the contrary, we would emphasize time and again that Kosovo belongs to all those who consider it to be their home country, regardless of their ethnic background. In our documents and writings, we advocated the right of return for Kosovo's Serbs in good standing, that is all those who had not committed war crimes or served and benefited from Serbia's regime. Moreover, we would always underline the commonalities shared by Kosovo Albanians and Kosovo-Serbs. For example, we would point out that as fellow citizens, they face very similar social problems. Poverty, unemployment, lack of access to quality health care and education, and so on. Such common social problems are much more important than their different ethnic identities. Kosovoer Serbs, who want to live, who want to live in peace and prosperity with their Albanian fellow citizens, have always appreciated this about our political movement. They understood early on that the perceived nationalism of our movement was directed against Serbia's colonialist project, not against Kosovoer Serbs. That is why today they treat me as their own Prime Minister. I regularly get letters and petitions from them, and they meet with me to discuss their needs and interests as members of our society. society. It bears underlining that they do so despite very serious threats they get from Belgrade. I think there is a broader lesson for progressives here. Today populism has become a term of abuse. But we should remember that a certain kind of populism is inherent within the very idea of democracy. The most basic principle of modern representative democracy, namely one person, one vote, is populist in character. Abraham Lincoln's famous dictum, government of the people, by the people for the people, is populist as well. In that same sense, our movement's catchy phrase, no negotiation, self-determination, could be seen as populist too. But this is the sort of populism we Democrats should never abandon. Otherwise, we risk a little bit of, coordinating the people and right-wing authoritarian are all too happy to step in as their spokespersons. In other words, instead of throwing the baby out with the bathwater, we should insist on a critical distinction between progressive, inclusive populism on the one hand, and exclusive blood and soil populism on the other. Our inclusive populism should affirm the people's right to self-government and self-government and self-government, determination while rejecting the control of the people as an organic totality united by blood ties. To the organic totality of right-wing populace, we should oppose class analysis. Only class analysis can expose the illusory character of all claims to organic totality. Moreover, only class analysis can reveal how much in common is shared by, let's say, an unemployed Serbian single mother in northern municipality of Mitrovica, and an unemployed Albanian single mother in southern municipality of Mitrovica, or anywhere else in Kosovo. I ran for office on two major promises, jobs and justice. Since assuming power over a year ago, these two policy areas have been front and center of my attention as Prime Minister. Besides having to go against the grain of the neoliberal dogma, in the Kosovo context, a social democratic reform agenda faces some very specific challenges. They have mainly to do with the limited resources of a developing economy and the restricted capacity of a young state. We are one of the poorest countries in Europe. of apartheid war and post-war mismanagement of our economic resources have left their unmistakable marks in the country's economy. As a result, an ambitious social democratic program of economic development based on the paradigm of the developmental state has to start with rather scarce resources. In addition, our state bureaucracy is young and therefore inexperienced. Thanks to poor recruitment practices of previous government, there is quite a bit of incompetence in our bureaucracy as well. Nevertheless, there are ways around these problems. My government has been pursuing a few different strategies to deal with them. Here I want to briefly mention only one of them, namely the enlisting of our diasporic community as a partner in our country's development. Kosovo has a large and significant diaspora in Western Europe and the United States. Without their help, neither our peaceful resistance nor our arms struggle against Milosevic regime would have been possible. Since the end of the war, their generous remittances have helped relieve poverty. In so doing, they have helped us by precious social peace. However, remittances are a means of survival, not one of economic development. What my government is trying to do is to mobilize our diasporic community as a part of our diaspora, in the development of our country. That means tapping into their human resources as well as financial capital. Their expertise can help us reform our bureaucracy, our education, healthcare systems, and our economy. Instead of their financial resources serving as mere humanitarian relief, we are trying to create opportunities for their investment in profitable enterprises that would create jobs for the youth and women. This partnership for economic development is a new, development is slowly starting to take shape. For example, our government has already started tapping into the expertise of our diaspora professionals for purposes of drafting fundamental laws and policies that we need to start implementing our economic program. In addition, our government is now issuing bonds to our diaspora. Such bonds help us rise additional funds while also offering a secure investment opportunity to our fellow competitors. abroad. In my view, this paradigmatic shift in the relation between home country and diaspora, namely from humanitarian relief to partnership for development, is one that holds great promise for developing countries facing similar circumstances. Even though it is too soon to judge the long-term net effects of my government's domestic reforms, early indicators speak quite favorably. Despite the adverse impact of the global pandemic COVID-19, last year our economy enjoyed a double-digit growth rate of 10.53% of GDP. A significant part of this growth was fueled by people's greater trust in our government. Such a trust translated into greater consumption, greater investment and greater tax revenue. Over the last year we had a 22% increase in foreign direct investment, while exports increased increased by 83%. Without us making any changes to fiscal policy, our tax revenue increased by 34%. In addition to economic performance, there have also been positive changes to our country's ranking in reputable international indices, tracking rule of law, press freedom, and transparency. For example, last year, the World Justice Project ranked us first in the Balkans in its rule of law index. We improved our ranking by 17 places in both, the World Press Freedom Index, issued by reporters without borders, and in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. In other words, our economic progress is going hand in hand with a process of democratic deepening, even though history teaches us that there is no necessary connection between the two. Moreover, today we are all witnessing how economic troubles, are leading to democratic backsliding, even in parts of the developed West. In these circumstances, Kosovo's recent experience offers a positive example to the country and a much-needed glimmer of hope. We live in dangerous times. In 2020, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists updated its doomsday clock from two minutes to midnight to 100 seconds to midnight. Midnight signifying terminal disaster for humanity. This is the closest to midnight it has ever been since its debut in 1947. In their rationale for the update, the group of renowned scientists and experts cites the increasing distrust and lack of cooperation in international politics as a key factor, heightening the risk from existential threats threats such as climate change and nuclear war. The democratic backsliding that we are witnessing across the world is greatly contributing to such a sorry state of international politics. In these critical circumstances, protecting democracy acquires a much more significant meaning. In fighting to protect it, we defend more than a form of government. We defend the prospects for decent human survival. despair is therefore not something we can afford at this point. Right-wing authoritarian leaders are closely cooperating with one another across international borders. We Democrats should do the same. The moral high ground is on our side. Before it gets too late, let us make sure we turn it into a political high ground. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to our discussion. Thank you. Thank you, Prime Minister Kerry, for that very, very fine, opening statement. I hope you will feel very welcome here in Oxford today. I just thought to probably start our interview with something that's quite relevant to what's going on right now. Today in the news, war veterans, Saskatchew the police, wanting higher pensions. I just want to get your thoughts on this, on that situation in Kosovo. We have two levels of minimum wage in Kosovo. one for those who are under 35 and the other for those who are above 35. In our election campaign early 2021, we have promised to increase minimum wage at the level which is 250 euros. it is 130 euros for those who are below 35 years old and 170 euros for those who are above 35 years old. So we have promised to make it 250. We are making it 264 for all workers in Kosovo. So we are doing better than our promise. In addition, we are removing taxes for all the salaries in Kosovo, public and private sector, up to a minimum wage. All those who work will be benefiting, whereas those whose minimum wage was under 250 will benefit especially. Now, minimum wage that we want to put is 264 euros. After a pension tax, it becomes 250 euros. However, previous governments have inflated the number of war veterans from around 20,000 to over 60,000. And we have done a comprehensive critique of this. We evaluate and estimate and honor very much all those who contributed for our liberation war. But minimum wage should not be abused for freedom fighters during the war. They need a respectable pension. Many of them are still young. They need a decent job. But previous manipulation of data from around 20,000 to security. 60,000. Now, to ask for all those 60,000 minimum wage because they were freedom fighters when actually two-thirds of them perhaps participated in the war, but were not war veterans. And there is no people in Kosovo who could say otherwise would be a violation. That's why I look forward to explain this one more time. But we are not going to consider war contribution as a veteran to be rewarded with a minimum wage wage is for labor wage is not for fighting yeah thank you let's talk about Russia for a for a second Russia is an imminent threat to Kosovo's national security and I wonder what your thought is what role it plays in the context of the conflict in Kosovo's Ukraine and how that affects the security of Kosovo. Disintegration of Soviet Union and disintegration of former Yugoslavia were similar in consequence even though not in character. Because Soviet Union generally imploded peacefully, whereas in former Yugoslavia we had four wars. In Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo, we did not fight with each other, but we all fought with Belgrade, who was trying to turn Yugoslavia into greater Serbia. In case of Soviet Union, we have Russian Federation with satellite parastates in the neighborhood, Belarus, then Transnistria, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia, but also Dombasa in Crimea, in Ukraine. So these are like, some of them are states, some of them are paraps, states, quasi-states, and Russian Federation today operates like a big octopus. Center is Russian Federation with tentacles in the neighborhood. On the other hand, Serbia also operates similarly. I cannot say that Serbia is an octopus, but perhaps a small quadripus, you know, half of the tentacles in the region, Republica Serbska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbian political parties in Montenegro who are against NATO and independence of Montenegro, some illegal structures in Kosovo, and Serbian Orthodox Church all over. So there is a special relationship between small quadripus and big mother octopus. And this is to the detriment of the security in the region. and that's why we need to put Kosova into NATO as soon as possible. Partnership for Peace Program is the first milestone. And we need all the help that can be given to us to become members of NATO. Meanwhile, we have NATO in Kosovo. And I have increased the budget for our defense, precisely because we have 48 forward operation bases of Serbia around our border, 28 of them being military and 20 of them Jandremaria. So there are strong cultural, historical and military links between Serbia and Kremlin, which makes us wary, not afraid, but vigilant. In the previous Parliament of Serbia, because they just had elections now, out of 250 members of parliament, 151 were members of the friendship group between Serbia. and Russian Federation. You know, in our parliament, I don't know how it is in British Parliament, but in our Parliament, friendship groups are at most a dozen of MPs. Friendship group with UK, with France, with Germany, with US. But there, over 60% of the Parliament are in the friendship group between Serbia and Russian Federation. And Gazprom owns 56% of oil industry of Serbia. Ministry of Defense of Russian Federation has a special office within the premises of Ministry of Defense of Serbia in Belgrade. And 100 miles from my office in Pristina, in Niche, in Serbia, there is so-called Russian humanitarian center from where they wage their hybrid war. And unjustified, illegal, unprovoked, military aggression and invasion of Russian Federation in Ukraine has shown that hybrid war is not a substitution for war, but rather it's preparatory phase. That's why we are working closely with our Western allies, with EU, US and UK, with NATO, in order to make sure that they are not going to attack us again. So we say that there's great progress we've made so far with the burning process, but we'll see major improvements with shifts regarding the EU integration of the Western Balkan? Germany is very important for the EU and for the Balkans. Every third Kosovoer citizen is not a Kosovoer resident. We have 1.85 million residents, but there are hundreds of thousands in addition who are in Western Europe, in London, in US and so on and so forth. 400,000, Kosovo Albanians are in Germany alone, and they are our labor force. So Germany economically is very important, but also politically is very important. And Berlin Process is something that I look forward to contribute and cooperate in. On 10th of June, this year, Chancellor Olaf Schultz is visiting visiting Kosovo and I'm very happy to see more bilateral cooperation, including Berlin process, which should come up with a new fresh start with Chancellor Schultz, who is a social democrat, and to bring about more investments in the Western Balkans especially in Kosovo, but likewise to establish common regional market, the famous for freedoms of people, services, goods and capital. But to this end, we need Serbia to recognize documents of Kosovo. Currently, Serbia does not recognize any of the documents of Kosovo. If you go with a passport, Kosovo passport, from Kosovo to Serbia, stop you at the border crossing. If you show the passport, they might confiscated it and you can get arrested. Whereas if you show your ID card, they suck your bio data and they give you a piece of paper in which it is written that you have lost your old Serbian ID, even though you might have not been born in 1999. If you land in Pristina Airport, which is the busiest airport in the region, before the Belgrade, one and you want to enter Serbia they don't let you in. You have to go through North Macedonia or through Montenegro because they consider landing in Pristina International Airport an illegal entrance in Serbian territory. So in one hand they don't recognize our country. On the other hand they don't acknowledge crimes of the past but above everything there is a plethora of bureaucratic administration. administrative liabilities that they are doing to our citizens. And I hope that new engagement in Berlin process, let's call it 2.0, with Chancellor Olaf Schultz, we will manage to have common regional market and finally Serbia at minimum to recognize our documents. That sounds hopeful and I hope that you know the continuing dialogue with Serbia, It continues the way you would like it too. I think you noted that in 2013, community of Serb municipality became part of the Brussels Agreement. You have signed this agreement and bounded by international law to implement provisions of such an agreement. But on the other hand, the Constitutional Court of Deem this agreement unconstitutional. And I recall you yourself highlighting that such community is a threat to national security, Negotiated Party, Serbia is adamant. You follow up with this agreement. And I wanted to ask one, why you think is this threat? And secondly, what the current state of this community association means for Kosovo. Kosovo has one existing association of municipalities. But Serbia wants Serb majority municipalities to create their own association as a third layer of power. with certain executive powers. My predecessor who signed that agreement made a mistake, and our Constitutional Court explained how that mistake concretely violates our Constitution. Association of Serbergerat municipalities as a document has seven chapters, and none of them is in compliance with our Constitution. Altogether, 23 articles of our Constitution are not being respected with this association of surmajority municipalities. And furthermore, this is only one of the 33 agreements between Kosovo and Serbia. There are no hierarchy of agreements. All agreements have the same value and status. That's why insistence of Serbia only in this agreement, shows rather the aspirations of Serbia and not the importance of the agreement. No Serb of Kosovo ever wrote a letter to me protesting for non-implementation of association of Serb major municipalities. Only Belgrade is protesting. And they are doing so because that's what they have been doing in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 90s. In 1991, April 1991, 14 municipalities, which had served majority, got together in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 1992, they declared independence. In February, 1992, they got their constitution. In December 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, they got international recognition of what we know today as Republic of Serbska, whose leader is in direct contact with despotic President Putin in Moscow. And Republic of Serbska is undermining the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. So they want this piecemeal incremental approach to create an entity within the entity in order to render you dysfunctional and turn you into a failed state. So, just like Russian Federation, also Serbia, does not like now directly to occupy others, but I think rather to take a portion of your territory and turn your country into a failed state. I'm not sure that Russian Federation, after their failed Blitzkrieg, wants to occupy every square mile of Ukraine. It rather wants to advance, to destroy, and to turn Ukraine into a failed state after a prolonged war. This is my impression. Serbia also is using these satellite parastates to turn its neighborhood into an assembly of failed states, of temporary states. So later on it enlarges its hegemony and domination. Association of Ser Majority municipalities will bring no good to Serbs as well. Serbs, just like Albanians, they need jobs and justice. They need fairness of the institutions. They need opportunity in socio-economic development. They need qualitative education and good health care. association of Serb majority municipalities is a construction of Belgrade to compensate itself from the failed dream of Greater Serbia. Thank you. I'm keen to open up the floor very soon for our students ask questions but one last question I'd like to ask is given that we're in Pride Month here I think is very relevant recently the Kosovo Parliament tried to adopt a civil code that would codifies same-sex marriage in your country's legislation. Unfortunately, it didn't quite pass and that's also in part because of lack of support from your party. Obviously right now, the parade is going on in Kosovo. I wanted to ask why you feel your MPs do not support this bill, even though your political parties manifesto supports it. I believe in human rights. I believe in human rights. I think all people, all humans should be equal. And rights, human rights, also civic rights, are not something that we should deserve. They belong to our being. We should deserve well-being through our labor and contribution. Whereas when it comes to human rights, those are rights that we are entitled to, with our very existence. And I think that in spite of any kind of differences, including sexual orientation, people should be equal. And a democratic state cannot behave in a way in which could violate human rights. I do not believe in democracy without human rights. So a democratic state, human rights, for all the humans are inviable, indispensable, and that's why our government and my political movement engaged for. You know, we're all creatures of God and or nature. And as a saying goes, you cannot love God and hate its creatures. I think it is very important to respect human rights and to be able to always understand each other. And rule of law should not cut our society into two, where you have those who are defenseless and those who are privileged. No privilege, no discrimination, human rights. And that's why we insisted that in civil code we define family union in a sense that it also includes minorities in terms of their sexual orientation. Because in the world, in history, and in life, we do not have only ethnic or religious minorities. We have also minorities according to sexual orientation. Thank you. Obviously my question was why your MPs didn't support this bill even though your political party manifesto said you support such rights, given the year from your response you probably would support the establishment of rights for every human being. Can I ask when perhaps you are going to introduce this legislation and how you're convinced your MPs to support the bill next time? Well, we're doing our best to explain with patients. and to engage in discussion with others because, you know, you can never have enough emancipation. Even those who believe that they are emancipated, they can do better and more. So also we are learning more. And I believe that next time things will go right and we are going to have the civic code, which is very important for our country. On the other hand, we are planning. to become members of Council of Europe, where our citizens finally will have the right to address to the European Court on Human Rights, which is not the case at present. A couple of months ago from Council of Europe, Russian Federation has been expelled. In fact, membership of Russian Federation has been suspended, and we want to become the 47th. member of Council of Europe and there everything is built based on human rights. And European Court of Human Rights is something that should become accessible to citizens of Kosovo on all the matters. Again, I think one important aspect of emancipation in this sense is that people must understand sexual minorities and according to recent studies and there has been a built-up of research and studies throughout 20th century and in 21st century around 7% of men do not consider themselves to be exclusively heterosexual and up up to 13% of women do not consider themselves to be exclusively heterosexual. This is not to say that around 10% of the population are homosexual, but 7% in case of men and 13% in case of women, the study shows also according to their declaration that do not consider themselves to be exclusively heterosexual, and I think we should respect that. Thank you. I'd like to open the floor for one or two questions. Please raise your membership card up and at Michael we brought to you. Would anyone like to ask a question? Sure. The member with a red top. Just wait for the mic. Thanks, Prime Minister, thank you for coming. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on something for us. You mentioned in your speech that you are, you are welcoming of Kosova Serbs who are sort of upstanding who didn't benefit from the regime. But didn't they necessarily benefit from the regime? Could you sort of elaborate on that relationship for us? Thank you. There are many Serbs in Kosovo who had to pay taxes to regime of Milosevic, but did not engage actively in. atrocities or ill-treatment. And people know that and they recognize and acknowledge that. Many Serbs who are in Kosovo live in Kosovo today precisely because they feel and they also know that we know that they did no harm to any individuals. And I think that there could be more serves like that who do not live in Kosovo and they are welcome. If they They do have a property which was not given to them by regime of Miloshavists, for example. They should enjoy it. If they sold that property already, then it's problematic to come back without buying some new property. But if they are like Serbs that we meet every day and who don't have bad conscience about the 90s, they are going to be more than welcoming Kosovo. And I discussed this with Serbs. There are 132,000 Serbs in Kosovo, which is like 5 to 6% of the population. And one third of them live north of River Iber. Two-thirds of them live south of River Iber. According to the statistical institution of the Republic of Serbia, in 1991 there were were 194,000 Serbs. Their number through the 90s did not really increase much, with the exception of police and military and their families. According to Ron Redmond from UNHCR, in July 1999, 80% of the Serbs who left immediately after the war, left together with Serbian police and military forces. And those left very early on. And this shows that we those who remained, they had nowhere to go. So they didn't have a plan B. They didn't have an extra house or apartment somewhere in Serbia. So that's why it is our duty to engage in cooperation and common development for mutual benefit. But I also can imagine that there are Serbs who do not live in Kosovo, they would like to come back. And if they are afraid, I am there to show that they should not be afraid. One issue that we have is with some of the legal structures of Serbia, who want to make sure that all Serbs vote only for one party. You know, in Serbia there is no much opposition. In opposition, there are less than one-third of political parties combined. basically two-thirds is one party and pluralism is not something they can be proud of. You know, they have this logic of one president, one party, one church. And we in Kosovo are very different. In Kosovo, opposition can win. And this is one of the tests of democracy. Can opposition win? In Kosovo we showed in local and general elections that opposition can win. And we will have to do some work in order to create a certain independence of Serbs of Kosovo from the tutelage, from the dictate of the illegal structures of Serbian. Thank you very much. Are they other questions? Okay. The member with the black top. Hi, thanks for your talk. I don't have a political question, but I'm hopefully visiting Kosovo in a few weeks, and I was wondering what your top recommendations would be. Thank you. Well, it's not easy because I do not your, I do not know your preferences and in Kosovo, we have everything. I would certainly encourage you to visit Pristina, capital town, but then Prisdren, which is second largest, with rich in culture and history. And then you should visit Mitrovica, which is one town with two municipalities that I also mentioned in my speech. And you should also visit Precaz. Precaz is a place where the uprising of Kosova liberation army got initiated and would be good to visit both farmers, schools, because we have a very young population, average ages 30, two-thirds of the population are under 35, young population of ancient people, this is how it's always, and a large majority of population. are included in one way or another into the education system. But don't forget to visit our two mountain rings, Shar Mountains and Rugova Mountains, because they are very beautiful and the weather is much better than here, I must say. Thank you. Right, that concludes. That concludes sadly tonight's event. Thank you all for coming and even more thank you Prime Minister Curti for coming to visit us today. Please join me in thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
