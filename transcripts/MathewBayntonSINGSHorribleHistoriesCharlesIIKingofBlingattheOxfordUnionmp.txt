 So Matt did agree in my office that he would have a sing along with us, but only if everyone joined in. Man in the scarf, what's your request? My name is... My name is... I said everyone has to join in. My name is... My name is... My name is Charles II. I love the people and the people love me so much they restored the English monarchy. I passed Scottish, French, Italian a little bit dame. Got 100% party animals chab√©. Spanings I adore named after me too. Like me, they were fun with a nasty hairdo. It's today my birthday. I can't recall. Let's have a party anyway because I love a mascot. Oh hail. The King of Bling, there's thing, Bell's thing, Ding, ding, I'm the king who brought back party in. King Charles, my daddy lost his throne at Kingswell Band. They chopped off his head, then Ollie Cromwell ruled the land. Old Ollie wasn't jolly, he was glam and he was proud. We've been mirrors of all spin, though. Still he's not allowed. As we've only died, the people said, Charlie Meharty, get rid of his dollors, come back with Rav the party. This action is what they called the monarchy restoration. It naturally was followed by a huge celebration. The death. There's more. Now, final question to end on a question to end on a credible serious note. The question we ask all of our speakers, if you could give one piece of advice to the members of the Oxford Union and the students at the University of Oxford, what would that one piece of advice be? Be kind. Thank you. Thank you.
