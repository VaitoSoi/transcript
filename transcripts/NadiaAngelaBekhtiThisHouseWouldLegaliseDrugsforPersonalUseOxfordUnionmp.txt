 Before I get into the bulk of my argument, I would like to rebut the proposition's assertion that the legalization of drugs is a choice that would champion personal freedoms. Surely the principle of personal choice is applied to a wide range of private activities, so it should be perfectly valid to ask why this should not extend to drug use. One can say that curbing the liberties of individuals, which is a common thread around the discourse around legalisation, is morally reprehensible. However, this libertarian argument is inherently flawed as this freedom would result in harm extending far beyond the realm of the individual, rendering these arguments not only selfish but ignorant. The problem with drug use is that this is gamble, rife with risk, and surely as citizens, we look to our government to do whatever they can to help mitigate these risks. And, with any crime, of course, prohibition cannot result in no deviancy whatsoever, but it can substantially decrease it. I will once again have to emphasize that the legalization of drugs for recreation is not simply a risk for one individual, but in fact can impact several spheres as a consequence. Let's first assess the economic cost. Legalization would decrease price and increase availability of drugs. Increase availability is linked to increased drug use, and despite the fact that, yes, a small proportion of people are the ones that become addicted to drugs, increased use of addicted substances will inevitably lead to increased addicts. Additional rehabilitation programs, education and training will put an incredible strain on our already overwhelmed health services. Moreover, if the now legal dealers of these drugs are large conglomerates who suddenly have the monopoly on these highly addictive substances, we will see the rise of these companies taking advantage of the most vulnerable in society. Big farmer will have nothing on big marijuana. Aside from this, let's not neglect the existence of a black market for drugs, even post-legalization. A black market will still exist unless all psychoactive and addictive drugs in all strengths are made available to people of all ages in unlimited quantity. Take a widely accepted legalized drug tobacco, which many pro-legislation campaigners taken as an example to legalize drugs. 11.6%, equating to almost 650 billion cigarettes a year, are supplied by a global black market. Think of the consequences of a dangerous unregulated drug black market. market, either the same or even worse than it is now due to legalization. This, for example, can be seen when ivory was legalized and the black market dealing saw a 66 for 10 uptick. This suggests that partial or even full legalization on bank goods does not necessarily reduce black market activity, as you would think. But of course, it's not always about the money. As mentioned, the increased strain on health services has not only an economic impact, but is directly harming people. This sounds slightly radical, but we cannot place all drugs, even currently legal ones such as alcohol and tobacco, on the same level. Yes, some have relatively worse or better long-term consequences on the human body after consistent use. The taxation and severe stigmatization of smoking and drinking while driving or pregnant has significantly driven down use. These substances are poisons, chemically, just simply socially acceptable ones, and the current free use of these, which we know are not good for our bodies, shouldn't mean that therefore we can justify the legalization of others. This is just an element of the human cost of legalization, which can be seen both home and away. The ethical implications due to the mistreatment of people involved in the trafficking of drugs in developing countries will not be helped by the legalization of drugs. It is quite plausible that the legalization could cause newly unemployed criminals to engage in kidnapping, extortion, robbery, and other forms of local crime. a criminal outburst may be the unintended consequence of legalisation. Aside from issues arising from the production and distribution of drugs, with the legalisation of marijuana in several countries or states in recent years, it is unsurprising that we have seen a substantial shift in cultural attitudes towards the use of drugs for medicinal and recreational use. However, many problems remain unrecognised by the public that I would like to bring your attention. All recreational drugs have been consistently shown to be a risk factor in precipitating schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among genetically vulnerable populations. These risks are even more pronounced among younger demographics, which even if excluded from legalisation, will still be much more likely to get hold of these substances once legalised. Furthermore, there are sufficient evidence to show that recreational drug use at the stage of life risk significant cognitive impairment, having long-term effects on the user's executive functioning, processing speed, memory, perceptual reasoning and verbal comprehension. We should recognise the extent to which easy access to recreational drugs increases the user's risks of developing substance use disorder and other mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Deaths of despair, including overdoses, have increased substantially during the pandemic and afterwards, and legalisation of so-called medical marijuana could risk adding to this number. The substance being subscribed as a relaxation tool for those suffering with mental illnesses. In light of the points I've laid out today, I hope, Honourable Members, that you can see that the utopia of legalised drugs that side proposition has proposed is laced with issues and dilemmas that ultimately might leave us with more problems than legalisation solves. Vote rationally, vote morally, and oppose the motion tonight. Thank you.
