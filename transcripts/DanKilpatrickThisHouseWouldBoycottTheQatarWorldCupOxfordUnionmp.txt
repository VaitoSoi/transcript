 Thanks very much. Mum and daddy is still awake. Let me start by saying that I may be speaking for the opposition tonight, but I'm not here to advocate for the World Cup in Qatar in any way. In my work for the Evening Standard newspaper, I've been critical of both the decision to award the tournament to Qatar, as well as the country's appalling human rights record, which includes the treatment of migrant workers who built the infrastructure for the tournament. So I want to be very, very clear. The World Cup should never have been awarded to Qatar, and the tournament will forever be a stain on the reputation of the beautiful game. There are reasons for everyone here to feel deeply uncomfortable about this World Cup. There are huge questions about the validity of the bidding process, and almost every one of FIFA's 22-man executive committee who awarded the tournament to Qatar have since been implicated in corruption or discredited in some other way. Since then, as Minkie outlined perfectly, more than 6,500 migrant workers have died in projects related to the tournament. If a minute silence was to be held for each, all 64 matches would have to be played entirely without noise. There is also deep-rooted inequality in Qatar. Women and migrants are second-class citizens. Same-sex relationships are outlawed and there is no freedom of speech. These elements alone should have disqualified Qatar's bid before even mentioning its sheer unsuitability in terms of geography and climate to host World Cup. By moving the tournament to winter, FIFA has caused mayhem to the football calendar, upending traditions, disrespecting fans and putting an intolerable strain on players. It is important to say that Qatar is far from the first politically controversial World Cup. The 1934 tournament was held in Benito Mussolini's Italy, the 1978 edition in Argentina during the military junta, and the last tournament, of course, was in Vladimir Putin's Russia. But Qatar, guitar has a compelling claim to be the most politically controversial World Cup in history, and certainly we are talking tonight about the biggest sports washing event ever. Football is a global game, and it should be for everyone, but clearly this is not the way. From a personal perspective, I resent how conflicted I feel about an assignment which should be the highlight of my career, but already feels tainted by the sheer human cost of the service. tournament. However, all that said, we are here not to discuss the merits of holding the World Cup in guitar, but to debate a boycott. Put simply, at this late stage when the wheels are already well and truly in motion, boycotting the World Cup would do more harm than good, as my fellow speakers have already outlined well tonight. Sadly, the time has long passed for making a stand. The tournament is set to go ahead and the only thing left is to ensure that this World Cup leads to positive change in Qatar and can be a lesson and turning point for not just the game but the wider world. So how can this happen? The best way is through people going to Qatar and reporting what they find and this job is obviously best fulfilled by independent media. I'm conscious that I'm speaking here tonight not as a football fan but as a member of the press and so it is in this capacity that I will spend, and it is in this capacity, sorry, that I will spend five weeks in Qatar this winter. It is therefore from this perspective that I intend to make the crux of my argument this evening. Some will argue that the media should make a stand by refusing to travel to Qatar or report on the matches. Starving Qatar of the positive publicity it obviously craves would be a powerful gesture to combat sportswashing and show solidarity with the oppressed, including local journalists who can face imprisonment for criticizing Qatari authorities. There is a case that the thousands of media who flocked to Russia in 2018, myself included, ultimately helped to project Putin's desired image of the country to the world, and clearly this was one of Qatar's aims in hosting the tournament as well. With this in mind, some media have already decided to boycott the tournament, including French newspaper Le Quotidian, while many individuals, journalists are staying away on ethical grounds. Those of us who are going have all been accused at some point of hypocrisy online when we've been critical of the tournament. But my response to anyone who questions why reporters should boycott Qatar or not go is simple. There is nothing FIFA or the Qatari authorities would welcome more than inquisitive members of the media staying away. Indeed, the more problematic an event, the more reason there is, the media should attend. All the reasons I've already outlined about Qatar's unsuitability to host the tournament are now, at this very late stage, compelling reasons to go to Qatar. In particular, having independent reporters on the ground in Qatar is perhaps the most vital element to ensuring the tournament can be a vehicle for positive change. If players or national associations were to boycott, it impacts the very staging of the competition. If sponsors and fans were to boycott, it impacts the funding and image of the competition and the ability of the organisers to put it on. If the media boycott, the tournament would still be shown across the globe, and the only thing impacted will be the tone and nature of the coverage. Without impartial media coverage, an even more sanitised version of events would be allowed to spread. Players and national associations can and will use their considerable platforms this winter to call for change, but these messages can only be amplified by an impartial media on the ground in Qatar. Without it, outright mistruths would prosper, and the historical record of the tournament would effectively be reduced to PRGuff and positive coverage from approved Qatari outlets. Imagine, for example, the record of Hitler's 1936 Olympic Games if impartial media had decided to boycott Nazi Germany and missed Jesse Owen's spectacular humiliation of the Fuhrer. As the old adage about journalism goes, if someone says it's raining and someone else says it's dry, it's not your job to quote them both. It's your job to look out the window. The Qatari authorities insist that everyone will be welcome in the country this winter and that it is misunderstood by outsiders. The function of a working media is to find out whether this is true. To cover events and to be on the ground, however uncomfortable that may be. This is a fundamental of journalism. There is no place for making a stand on principle. As I've already said, I went to the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and looking back at my glowing coverage of the tournament, I do shift uncomfortably slightly, wondering if I too was a sports-washing tool by presenting the image of Russia that Putin wanted the watching world to see. So plainly, the media has a responsibility to report with impartiality and scrutiny from Qatar and not be drawn into the carnal atmosphere of the tournament and the trap of sportswashing by celebrating the football without considering the wider context. Go ahead. Are we debating whether the country the football team boycott or the media of the boycott? I think we're debating a boycott, but I'm speaking personally, as other speakers have spoken personally, and as a member of the media. I'm speaking on behalf of the media. where was I? Ultimately, broadcasters and reporters who go to Qatar must be given time to cover not just the matches, but the country's political and human rights problems. It is only through a barrage of scrutiny and negative publicity that Qatar's aims to accrue soft power by hosting the tournament will ultimately fail. The pressure from human rights groups, amplified by the media, has already led to some significant changes in laws around workers' rights in Qatar since they won the tournament in 2010. These groups are continuing their work and increasingly being joined in the activism by national associations and players who can help ensure that the overarching message from this tournament is not the one the Qatari government hope to promote. And impartial media holds the key to amplifying this message, which is why I will be going to Qatar and I'm arguing against a boycott this evening. I urge you all to do the same. Thank you.
