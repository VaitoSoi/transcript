 Thank you, Vodika. I now look to Dr. Anjana Ahujah to close the debate. Thank you, Madam President. to be here. If you had a check for a trillion dollars, you could give it to the bench opposite. They could send you on an interminable journey to an uninhabitable planet where you are very likely to die as soon as you step out of the door. Or you could spend it for the good of humanity and your fellow citizens, you could look at the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, a kind of checklist on making the world a better place. There are 17 in total, not just climate justice, which we've heard a lot about, but there are bids to end hunger, end poverty, promote gender equality, and provide food and water security in the future. Over the past decade, humankind has gone backwards on many of these. Just in the pandemic, half a billion people have been pushed into extreme poverty by having to pay for life-saving healthcare. I oppose the motion tonight on the basis that colonising Mars is misconceived. It's a project that does not serve the needs or aspects. of our planet, and it doesn't even uphold human values. It sucks money, energy, time and talent away from the pressing challenges of today. It does not advance science or humankind or the economy any more meaningfully or inspirationally than unmanned or uncrewed space exploration and time limited. visits to other planets. So what would be its purpose? If we're looking for extra living room, why aren't we building floating cities on the seas? Why aren't we building at the top of mountains in the deserts? If we're looking to colonise other planets because Earth itself might be in peril and future generations might need somewhere, to live. Frankly, that is a terrifying prospect. What does it say about our stewardship of the only naturally habitable planet in this solar system? Open your eyes, your lungs, your mouths. We have a ready-made life support system here on Earth right now in the form of water, air, natural resources. Why are we not doing more to preserve life on this beautiful planet? This is where public sentiment lies when it comes to space research. A 2018 poll by the Pew Research Organization showed that the top priorities for NASA, as judged by the public, were monitoring the Earth's climate, as satellites do, and protecting us from asteroid collisions. Visiting Mars and the moon came the lowest on those priorities. What would it cost anyway? On Earth, as a rule of thumb, if you want to build a new city, it will cost you between $100,000 and a million per resident. Think of what Elon Musk wants to do, build a colony of a million people. If we take the middle ground on that, half a million per resident, and that's going to be very conservative about getting to Mars. We're talking half a trillion dollars. Minimum. People argue that funding science is not a zero game. sorry, is not a zero-sum game that you can fund stuff in space, you can fund stuff on Earth. But when it comes to agencies and governments, you can't spend the same dollar twice. I cannot in all conscience say it's justified to spend those sums of money, especially public money, on such folly. Okay, what about private money? That makes me think of e-lossom. Musk. He's talked about sending people to Mars, the million-person colony. I really admire his ambition, his big thinking, his business acumen. But as we might say of his self-driving cars, what are the rules of the road? Well, let's look at what SpaceX is already doing. It's already put 2,000 satellites up in space. Astronomers complain that the bright satellites are interfering with the wonderful night skies that humanity has enjoyed for millennia. China has had to take evasive action with its space station to avoid the satellites. The head of the European Space Agency has protested that Musk is making the rules on the commercial space industry. It's not that Musk is necessarily doing anything wrong, it's just that lawyers recognize that the rules and the laws in space are very vague. So who would make the laws on Mars? Who would enforce them? If we believe that democracy is the cornerstone of society, which I sincerely hope that everyone in this room does, what happens when those making the rules in space have their fingers in every single Martian pie? from the means of transport on and off the planet and even the life support system for you and your family. When it all gets too much, where does a Martian resident go to seek asylum? Is it really the case that he who has the technology calls the shots? That doesn't sound like democracy to me. That sounds like a recipe for spreading autocracy across the solar system. We've heard tonight that people think that it's a semantic issue about whether we're talking about visiting other worlds or colonising them, populating them. Actually, we're talking about a permanent human settlement here with all its requirements for habitation, sustenance, but meaningful work, education, culture, leisure. Getting there and building a society is just the beginning of the challenge. How do we choose who goes? What system of justice should operate there? Should exiles, should those exiles that leave Earth be able to claim planetary sovereignty? Will there be turf wars between Earth and Mars? They'll be fighting over the same resources, at least at the beginning. I think these are intractable challenges. And, you know, people might say, well, you know, those are short-term, medium-term, issues. Actually, I think there are long-term problems too. Whether on Earth or Mars, any community will still be populated by humans with all their physiological and psychological needs. They need to thrive, not just survive. Will it ever be ethical or justified to raise children on Mars, for example, in a Martian environment that we know now is bad for their physical? and their psychological health. Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should. When we talk about colonising another planet, what are we saying about our priorities and values at this precarious moment in our planet's history? Supporters of settling Mars might invoke the Apollo project, and they already have. And I'm going to quote JFK's words to you again. we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills. Times change. We have been to the moon. The last person there visited 50 years ago in 1972, and the sky did not fall in on space exploration. our horizons expanded. Don't believe the myth that we need to populate Mars for science and technology to progress. We have the internet, we have satellites, we have AI, driverless cars, we have mind-controlled artificial limbs. I think if JFK were alive today, he would recognize that the hard problems that we face today and now the grand challenges facing us on this planet, poverty, hunger, the climate crisis, disease, water security, inequality, which make life unlivable for so many people already here. In the long term, science is one of our noblest pursuits, but sometimes we honour that nobility in what we choose not to do. If there is life on Mars, we should be. preserve it, just as we preserve habitats on Earth. Just because Mars is far away does not justify applying different norms to its protections. To do otherwise is colonial thinking of the kind that I hope we are leaving behind. Shunning the proposal might even save space science in the long run. A disastrous dystopian adventure on Mars might make a great Netflix drama, but would, I think, sully everything and anyone who enabled it. So how would you spend that money, the trillion dollars for the good of humanity? Not every billionaire who's spending in space wants to ride on a rocket. There's a California real estate developer called Donald Bren, who has given $100 million to Caltech to figure out how to put solar panels in space and beam the energy back to Earth. This idea is pushing technology now. If it works, it can bring safe, clean, reliable energy to communities who don't have it. It can bring it to disaster zones. We do not have to live on other planets to build new space economies or to advance humankind or to become better versions of ourselves. I urge you as a space enthusiast, a parent, a future grandparent, and a citizen of this beautiful planet. I urge you to oppose the motion. Thank you.
