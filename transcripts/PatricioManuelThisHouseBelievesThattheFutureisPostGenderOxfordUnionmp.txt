 When I was preparing for this debate, I was watching some videos, and of course, was watching Angela Davis. And the first thing she said was during one of them, it's so cold in here, and I laughed at it, and now I'm freezing at this point. I came from L.A., so it was like 80 degrees in Christmas. So this is a big shock. First off, I just want to thank the Oxford Union for having this conversation, for having me. It is really nice to not debate my existence, and that's usually the conversation that we're having. I feel like we're actually in alignment a lot of the times in terms of those who are defending this motion. I also kind of want to thank the WBC. They are the World Boxing Championship, who decided to, create a whole transgender league, despite the fact that I have been consistently fighting cisgender men since, well, it's farring since 2013, and keeping me top of mind. So I think that's the reason why I'm kind of here is it kept me in the news. So all the people with the transphobia, I appreciate it, you're keeping me relevant in this world. So it actually was really hard when I was emailed about this proposition, mainly because I see a lot of why a post-gender world would be great. I'm in definite agreements that patriarchy sucks. It harms everyone. I agree that there are too many inequities in this world. I believe that non-binary and those who do not consent to being gendered at all are very relevant. But then I remembered how much I love my gender. And that brought me right back over to this side. I really, really love being a man. And I have fought tooth and nail, and I definitely think that's punching above my weight class with that, to be able to stand here and say, like, I am a man. And, you know, I definitely don't want to be in a world where we limit people in terms of what they can do because of their gender, but I also don't want to be in a world where we limit people's ability to identify themselves. You know, it's interesting. I'm just thinking about the fact that there are probably people in this room right now who are actually arguing with the fact that I stated the fact that I'm a man. And that's the inherent problem that we're trying to tackle here, is who gets to define a person other than themselves? You know, I believe that what we need to really abolish are these narrow gender binaries. For many of us, gender is an inherent aspect of our self-identity. It doesn't have to be contradictory to a liberated world. And actually, I feel it is in service to building one. I think stories such as my own are examples of what are impossible when we embrace our gender on our own terms and don't succumb to society's preconceived notions. It's actually funny. The last time I was in England was I was in London in 2009. and I was actually representing Team USA against Great Britain. At the time I was fighting Natasha Jonas. We split our fights one-on-one, very close fights. I really wish I could have gotten that third fight to settle the score with her. She went on to become a representative for Britain in the 2012, first-ever women's Olympic boxing trials, and I ended up going on to him a man. Obviously, we went to a slightly different paths, but we're still in this sport together. And, you know, it was, I mean, honestly, losing the Olympic bid was one of the most painful things I've had happened in my life. And unless you're involved in sports, you probably don't know how painful that is. But it truly is like grieving a death because you're grieving a dream. But it was during this time when I gave up that dream that I remembered a dream that I had very early on. And actually, I don't think a dream is really an accurate term, but rather annoying I had ever since I was a young child. And I have this very distinct memory when I was a kid. I was probably about eight. I was sitting on the toilet, very, very vivid memory of that. I had gotten a wristwatch, a wallet that had a chain on it, because it was the 90s. I'm, you know, 37. And I learned to tie my shoes. So I had the bunny loop style, because I'm not really that I get to tie my shoes now. And I distinctly remember saying, like, today I am a man, you know, distinctly. And I want everyone to challenge here, think about, like, the moments you remember your own gender identity, because I think sometimes cisgender people take it for granted, that there was a moment in your life where you thought, this is who I am, particularly in relation to gender. You know, I didn't grow up with much trans representation. You know, I said I'm 37. I'm very jealous of younger people, getting to see trans people, getting to have the language actually given to them very early on to name themselves. But despite all that, I had a knowing that I was going to be a man, despite no one telling me that that was even possible. Every time I imagined a future, it was just me as a man. And it actually took life, slowly chipping it away out of me that made me settle on different roles and try on different genders, but really for myself to be very clear of like, no, the gender that I am now, the one that is standing here before as a man, has always been who I am. And I think all children, whether they're considered gender non-conforming or not, start developing an awareness of gender identity at a very young age, to say, around three years old. And we don't fully understand the hows and wise. I'm definitely not a biological essentialist. I don't think you just come born knowing that right away. I think humans are way too complicated to be dissilled in something that simple. but I also don't think that it is the sole responsibility or rather the sole influence of societal influence that gives people their gender identity. And I think actually trans people are an example of this. While I may have been influenced by certain cues by society of my gender identity as a man, my self-knowledge of that I would grow into a man was certainly not a symptom of society's conditioning. There is an interesting study by Christina Olson, who is conducting long-term research on transgender children, and her study is proving what so many of us have experienced and voiced regularly, that we start developing a strong gender identity in childhood just as our cisgender counterparts. One particular interesting point in the study is inclusion, that self-knowledge of gender identity is the cause of social transition, not the consequence. They administer tests of gender identity to gender-not-conforming children in her study, and two more additional groups, including one of transgender children, and one group of children who identified with the sex they were assigned at birth. None of these groups differed in the average strength of identities, meaning trans boys who were living seen as girls, identifies as boys as strongly as trans boys who transitioned, and the cis boys who always lived as boys. When I find this emerging science fascinating, I'm also not comfortable with relying on these studies solely. I think, though, it's in alignment with not only our personal experiences, but the historical and cultural examples of gender variance throughout the world. The concept of the gender binary is not a universally accepted truth, despite what the edited history of colonization would want you to think. We know that many cultures across the globe had not only a wider understanding of gender variance in its people, but had specific names and roles for these members of society. It's sad to see so many of these cultures that held people who existed outside the dominant gender binary in respect are now criminalized. When calling for gender abolition, is it also a call to abolish these legacies and histories as well? The concept of gender abolition, to me, is throwing the baby out with a bathwater. Gender isn't inherently problematic. It's the narrow definition surrounding it that are the problem. Gender doesn't have to be an ultimatum. Not only in the sense that biological sex is a matter of two options, which has already been disproven if anyone wants to argue that. but that it is flawed, reductive, false belief that extends a gender in identity, expression, and roles. Instead of the belief, this is what men do? What if we think this is the kind of man that I am? I believe that every time we show up as our full selves, not the one that has been censored by societal norms, but the version of our self that grants us gendered euphoria, and I am the belief that this is something that all people experience. This is not a trans-exclusive experience. I mean, this may sound corny, but I really feel when a person is happier with themselves, it leads to more empathy and space for others in a better world. I know that this has been the case for myself. When we see gender as a block in our self-expression rather than a cage that dictates who we are and what we can do, it helps us all to be free. This is the future we should be striving for. Tonight, I urge you to vote against this proposition, and instead of a future that is post-gender, we work to the world that sees gender as nothing more than what it is, simply words to describe a part of ourselves and abolish harmful norms that are preventing us from an equitable future. Thank you.
