 Mr. President, sir, it is a very great pleasure to be here and to be confronted with such a delightful and conspicuous contradiction from the bench opposite. We had two speeches. May I just, we had a visual illustration. We had stone axe. We, it was literally, materially, fundamentally stated, individuals do not matter. And then, my dear colleague, Sir Richard, came with a very sensible compromise in which he said, yes, individuals do matter, but they're shaped by circumstances. Now, dear me, what a revelation, what astonishingly original thinking. I labour here under a process of revelation. I am, you know, in about my 60th year of writing history. And you know, I'd never thought these thoughts before at all. Never for a moment had it crossed my mind. Now, fortunately, may I, I'll be more formal, the third proposer of the motion cited Carlisle, and cited Carlisle, who is very easy to parody. Can we just think for a moment, though, what Carlisle was? He was a figure who believed in greatness, in an age that produced greatness. The third speaker has spoken, quite frankly, in saying, we're in a petty age of the common man that dare not confront greatness and hesitates even to use the word. Now, that seems to me to be a pathetic failure. It also is one of the reasons that democracy itself is not working. If democracy loses that, my colleague Mr. Gibson that sense of the possibility of the Churchill that sense of the possibility of a Lincoln by language this is more than mere sorry the diminution of the word propaganda this is turning language what this place is about what is founded on is two things the notion of parliamentary debate and the notion of rhetoric of persuasive speech. All human thought is in human heads. People support it because people use the language that converts them, that makes them want to support it, that makes them want to fight, that makes them want to march, that makes them want to support. That matters. And only an individual can do it quite simply. But again, let's just go back more closely to the Carlisle's statement. He says biography. Now, he I think had a very particular notion of biography, but as somebody who's written quite a few of them, the biographer begins precisely with what the proposal of the motion was talking about. You begin with the idea of tradition. You begin with the specificity of circumstance. You begin with the structure of family, all of these things. The individual isn't, you know, born like Venus out of the head of Zeus. you were a creation of circumstances. This is precisely of course, this is of course precisely what the anybody who's ever thought about this seriously, particularly a conservative, that we've been getting a rather large amount of leftism. The conservative understands that the individual is fundamentally as Burke said, a product of the past, of tradition. What matters is what you do. with it. Let us take somebody that I've studied quite a lot. Let's take the example of Henry the 8th and let's a man who is either great or as destructive in many ways as Hitler, and he's frequently referred to as the English Stalin. Let's look at how this actually plays out in his case. The two key things I think that underlie Henry's reign if we simply ignore the structures of monarchy. is the Reformation itself, the other is the use of the printing press, exactly the kind of thing that the proposers of the motion were talking about. Let's look what happened. Henry begins his reign the most conventional of Catholics. He had a sort of little spark in his mind that had been planted by studying Erasmus, so he knows the new Latin, which will eventually make him rather sensitive the new approaches to theology, which were also grounded in the what we call the back to the sources, the Adfonte's movement that's pioneered by Erasmus and then developed in a very different way by Luther. But what is striking is Henry hates Luther. Henry hated Luther for the point at which he writes a book against him, the first time apart from King Alfred that the king had actually done that. He then ruled. a savage persecution of Luther, which uses figures like Sir Thomas More, with more, I'm afraid, figuring as a particularly brutal minister of police. And then you know what happens? He meets a woman. He meets Anne Berlin. We can date it to, this again is what worries me so much about what I've been hearing. The complete inability to understand that history is depends on the moment, on circumstance. You were talking about Hitler. You were not in any way diminishing the importance of Hitler. You were simply pointing out what Henry does. He seizes a moment and the world literally stands on his head. He pledges on the 1st of January 1527 and you can date it literally from one word in a letter. On the 1st of January 1527, he pledges to marry Anne Berlin. And at that point, everything changes. His complete stance on religion shifts and reverses. There would have been no reason for an English reformation if Henry VIII had not fallen in love with Anne Berlin. This vast chain. You were talking about cathedrals, you were talking about monasteries. The vast sweeping away of 600 monasteries would not have happened. We would have had vastly more of those structures standing. It is one man at one moment. with one woman. It is the astonishing sense of particularity of specificity of circumstance. We have another example at the moment which of course we should all be looking at. It is when the clown becomes a great man. It's called Zelensky. Zelensky was a clown. Zelensky was a mere comedian. What happens is he is offered circumstance. He is offered the unique circumstance of the birth of the nation. What we're witnessing in the Ukraine is everything that my opponents disapprove of. We're witnessing a genuine sense of national creation, a genuine sense of greatness, a sense of a nation born exactly as America was reborn under Lincoln, born in blood and conflict and horror. That is what we are talking about. Mr. President, sir, I got interested in interested in history, and this relates to little jive which the proposer threw against me. I got interested in history as a boy of very humble background like Richard, and I was given a book because I had many problems of ill health when I was a child, and I was receiving physiotherapy from an extraordinary woman who took rather a shine to me, and she gave me a book called 100 Great Lives, and she said, you'll be one of them. them. Now I'm not. And I'm a sort of proximea Kessit, almost getting there. But why I survived what people tried to do to me was because I had that self belief, because I dared to resist the great forces that you people have worshipped so slavishly. I do not believe in slavery. I do not believe that you simply give way. I believe, like Zelensky, like Churchill, like Henry, that you fight and that that matters.
