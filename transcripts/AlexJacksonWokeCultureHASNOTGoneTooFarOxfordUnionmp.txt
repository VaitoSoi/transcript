 Good evening everyone and thank you Mr President for giving me the opportunity to speak on such a divisive topic in our historic chamber. Tonight, as I'm sure you're aware, we are debating whether so-called woke culture has gone too far. This motion is a bit of a strange one, given that our very own Oxford English dictionary defines the term woke as well-informed, up to date, an alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice. If we take this definition as given, it's a bit confusing to me how someone could possibly argue that these ideals have gone too far. The opposition tonight, however, will try their hardest to argue that the word woke has taken on a completely different meaning. Sorry. One representing censorship, oppression, and Snowflake Gen Z, students being brainwashed by the evil left-wing education system. The phrases freedom of speech and cancel culture are ones that we passed around casually tonight, surely with little explanation of what they mean or entail in true scaremongering fashion. I will make two main points tonight. Firstly, that the right to freedom of speech does not imply the right to freedom from consequence. And secondly, that the majority of ideals that so often people correlate with woke culture, are rational, compassionate, and not as scary as the Daily Mail may have had you believe. Before all that fun business, though, it gives me great pleasure to introduce your proposition speakers for tonight. You've just heard from Vodika, a fellow committee member and classic student at Christchurch. Considering Vodika studies classics, it's not at all surprising to me that she's arguing against modern social attitudes tonight. after all, she has spent the last two years of her degree, living thousands and thousands of years in the past. After that, you'll hear Toby Young's views on the matter. Mr. Young is the founder of the Free Speech Union and an associate editor of The Spectator. In 2020, amidst the pandemic, Mr. Young was outraged when PayPal shut down his Free Speech Union accounts as a result of him retweeting misinformation about the COVID infection rates. Let's just hope for all of our sakes that he's learnt his lesson and has managed to find reliable sources for tonight. Fine. Next, you're here from Tommy Wen, a committee member from Teddy Hall. It's really great to see Tommy here in the flesh and actually quite a new experience, given that he was nowhere to be seen when we were all working on the term car during the fact. Finally, you'll hear from Constantine Kisen, a satirist, podcaster, author and political commentator. Mr. Kaysen made headlines in 2018 when he refused to sign a university behavioral agreement form, prohibiting jokes about sensitive social issues. He's a perfect fit for the Oxford Union, as he is no stranger to debating controversial topics and asking the biggest questions of our time. For example, only a couple of weeks ago, he sparked a furious debate on Twitter when he made the unbelievable claim that Marmite was the work of the devil. Mr. President, these are your guests, and they are most welcome. So, freedom of speech. You can't understand. You can't open social media these days without someone banging on about these three words. It seems to somehow be one of the most divisive phrases in modern culture, despite it leading to the hugely important ideas of free expression and free thought. This very society was founded upon the principles of upholding freedom of speech for both students and staff under religious censorship from the university. It may be surprising to some of you that even though I find myself on this side of the aisle, I believe freedom of speech is fundamental to the functioning of a society and the basis for cultural progression. However, the issue we find with freedom of speech these days is the majority of people do not seem to understand the simple fact that freedom of speech does not imply freedom from consequence. Here's how I see it. Anybody here is well within their rights to stand up and shout abuse a bouncer in a queue. However, that does not mean that you should later expect to be allowed into the club. Kanye West was well within his rights to make anti-Semitic comments on Twitter. As for Adidas, when they abandoned him and took away a huge chunk of his earnings. In the case of social media, everybody here is well within their rights to tweet exactly what they think on every single social issue out there. However, a future employer is also well within their rights to judge you for it and act accordingly. It's a good system. and one that I would argue is responsible for much of the progression of social attitudes we've seen. You say your thoughts on something? If it makes reasonable sense and the majority of society agrees, it becomes accepted. If not, it gets rejected. This is the process through which attitudes and cultures change. The issue I'm sure the opposition will have tonight, however, is with a part of this process that involves rejecting thoughts, a process of rejecting thoughts that simply don't go along with the woke left snowflake radical agenda, which leads me on to my next point. How radical really are the views associated with the word woke? A poll from UGov in mid-20201 did some research into what views people most commonly associate with the word woke. Topping the list of evil, radical, woke sins were the support of Black Lives Matter, equality for LGBT plus, and the removal of statues of slave traders. I don't know about you guys, but to me, these don't sound diabolical or evil in any way. What about this has or can go too far? People using their democratic right to protest police brutality, believing that people should be able to freely express themselves and be who they want to be, removing statues, which put some of the most evil, people in history quite literally up on a pedestal, I'd hope the majority of you would agree that these views are not extreme or dangerous. If this is what people associate with so-called woke culture, then to me, the definition of the word woke has not changed one bit. It still upholds the values of being aware of what's going on in the world and supporting racial and social justice. The real truth of the matter is that this word has been appropriated from its original foundation in the civil rights movement through right-wing bigoted rhetoric into a buzzword that can be deployed in 10-second TikToks to radicalize young people into supporting outdated, illogical and harmful social attitudes. We need to reset and reclaim this word for what it actually means, not the political tool that the right wing has turned it into. With that, I'll conclude. Both the very definition of woke culture given by the dictionary and the common attitude among the public state that this phenomena is not what the Daily Mail wants you to believe. It still very much stands for believing in equality, freedom and acceptance. Without these values, we are nothing. Therefore, I urge you all to vote down this motion tonight and walk out the no door. Thank you. You know,
