 Thank you and thank you to all the people that have spoken before me. Given it at the end of the night, I must say that, you know, I'm glad there's still somebody here at the end of the night, so it's already better than most of my dates. That wasn't meant to be a joke. It's appropriate that I've been asked to oppose the idea that woke has gone too far, because Pearce Morgan branded me the wokeest man in Britain, to which I said, please, peers, don't assume my gender. Is that's right, you can be woke and funny. You can care about social justice, but also be self-deprecating. But of course, the term woke is a largely nonsense, redundant term, that was invented by people who have always had a problem with social justice. They spent, you know, the 15 years of people overwhelmed, wanting or having a Labour government desperately trying to oppose all those sorts of social progresses that were introduced and decade went by as they couldn't find a word for it and eventually they got woke so now they used that to use all sorts of ideas to deride ideas that are aggressive and have been for a long time you know we used to listen to people on that side of the debate you would have this sort of fear that there is some cultural revolution happening that transgender people are trying to change the very fabric of society, that were being overtaken by a woke mob, they say. Transgender activists, transgender warlords, they'd have you believe if you were to read the Daily Telegraph comment section. No offence to those of you that write for the Daily Telegraph comment section. They're trying to overthrow society as we know it. It is, of course, ridiculous. You know, one of those people asking for when they talk about them going too far, which is at the heart of this debate, well, they're asking for things like access to life-saving healthcare or to use the name they've said they want to be referred to or the pronouns. Now, I don't really think that's woke. My grandmother, who's certainly not woke, she's 90. She'd just call that being polite. But people on that side, they seem to think it's going too far and they obsess over it at the expense of a lot of real issues that people have. They're painted as people who are prime examples of asking for too much. But you know what? these people have always been claiming to have too much. Much like the arguments made against interracial marriage at one point, against same-sex marriage, against equal pay or legal rights for women, when those arguments were made, as Yasmin referenced earlier, they were always derided, usually by a majority, as demanding too much and going too far. I mean, just 15, 10, 15 years ago, same-sex marriage wasn't supported by most people, that was seen as going too far, and yet now, the vast majority of people in this country have no issue with it, consider it to be a right. It's because things change, not that they go too far, but these are the things that the proposition believes. So if we were to believe that woke culture, and by the way, I think the term, as we've kind of all agreed, woke culture is a bit of an absurd as a term, has gone too far, then we must think somehow that we've reached a pinnacle of liberation already and now it's just getting much too wild. Earlier this year, and this really surprised me, I spoke to some of the people that marched in the first Pride March in this country, which was 50 years ago on the start of July. Now, they faced the sorts of verbal and physical aggression that you can imagine. They were called names like puffs and shirtlifters, but also they were called things like yuppies or social justice warriors. Basically, they were called woke at a time when they were just asking for the idea of homosexuality to be decriminalized in this country. Now, attitudes of the vast majority of Britons have changed since that time. But what surprised me was that when I spoke to those activists, those gay and lesbian people as they were at the time, one of the interesting things was that a lot of the other gay people they spoke to when they tried to develop a movement, the original modern gay rights movement in this country, was that a lot of those gay people, when it was illegal and they couldn't tell their families or the workplaces, not the most basic rights, they said to them, and this was those words, that they thought it was going too far, that if only they shut up, if only they don't make a fuss, then they can carry on going to a gay bar in Earl's court, but they shouldn't go too far and have this protest or develop a movement. And those were gay people because they thought in silence they had some rights. So there's always been this idea that it's too far, that now I suspect probably not a person in this room thinks that being gay should be a criminal act in this country. Of course, almost nobody would think that today. Now, I later spoke actually for the same story to every living UK Prime Minister. Well, every Prime Minister at the time, I lose track of how many we've had since July. It was six there. And do you know what they said? Almost without exception, Theresa May most notably, someone who'd oppose gay rights but would later be a big supporter of him. and trans rights for that matter. They said they regretted the arguments they'd made, that they admired those activists who were called things equivalent to woke at the time. And they said, as John Major said in the piece he wrote for me, that he wished he'd gone further, not that they'd gone too far. And if you were to accept what the proposition is saying, then you have to accept somehow that the shifting stands have stopped, and now we're too far. Well, history tells a very different lesson to that. Now, the proposition makes an argument also that we live in some kind of cancel culture. Now, this is absurd hyperbole, frankly. You know, if I hear one more time that J.K. Rowling has been cancelled. A woman who sold more books this year than she has for 10 years, who's a dollar billionaire, and can tweet anything and make the front page of certain newspapers. I mean, if that's cancel culture, then I only hope to achieve the heights of cancel culture. Now, they claim that it's overtaken British society and that people become victim to this, but I don't accept that. Because what it really is, is a necessary realignment of who has power, or more accurately, who has a voice in our society. It's not cancel culture that people on my side of the debate champion. It's accountability culture. Now, they're not simply my words, though they're good words, they're right. But they're the words of Graham Norton, who said it at a discussion a couple of weeks ago with Times Radio. He said simply, he didn't really express an opinion, but he said that when it comes to the trans debate and J.K. Rowling, trans people should be asked. Well, what happened? The furious, sensitive right-wingers, the anti-wote lobbyists, they mercilessly attacked him, and they got him so abused that he felt he had to delete his Twitter profile. They played the victim, not this side of the argument. You know, the anti-woke brigade were furious. But you know what? You get people that would say, you know, J.K. Rowling has been cancelled just because she doesn't satisfy the arguments of the transgender lobby and that's the reason the West is coming down. Sorry, that sounds a lot like what Constantine said, but actually that was Vladimir Putin who made that argument. So at least you have strong supporters on the side of your argument. people that made basically exactly the point that you did tonight. I know I would never want to be on the side of Vladimir Putin in a debate. I think it's certainly this character of what's happened with J.K. Brown. So the Fruitweek Union is currently represented someone called Ginny and Phillips. And she lost her job at Hartford College. She was an adult, young fiction writer. She was fired after a revolt by other staff at Parker Commons when she tweeted, hashtag, I stand with J.K. Rowanman. It's not JK Rowan's the people who express any support from you don't have her power and her money. She had actually retrained as a heavy good driver. And the week after she lost their job at Parker Collins, her husband died of cancer. Are you saying that's what you mean by holding people to account? Well, there's clearly there's a tragedy in that person's experience. I'm afraid that, you know, on other points you made in your speech earlier, where you talked about conservatives fearing and losing their job, well, if they happen to be people that have racist or bigoted views, then I'm afraid that's not the same as people who don't have those views, because we're better than that as a society. Now, many people would say that they make the argument somehow that it's out of touch with the working class to have views like mine. Well, I think that's patronising to many working class people. Because the truth is that their argument is not about free speech or cancelling. Really, this question is an argument about power and who has the right to claim it. These are the things that... Oh, hang on. There you go. In the words of Justin Welby, oh God. They seem unbothered by punching down. Racist jokes, homophobic jibes, the very idea of transphobia or Islamophobia. They think that supporting those things, caring about those problems, makes you a snowflake. It's a term they often use. Yeah, they're incandescent when people punch up, when people from minority groups that have been denied a voice throughout history attempt to reclaim that voice and have some of the power that people straight white men, cisgendered men have, they're incandescent when they try and claim that power back. So to accept the premise of the motion that woke culture has gone too far is to determine that the clock of progress should stop ticking. I think that would be ridiculous. Maybe it should tick off Toby Young, but I don't think that's no problem. And so there is no finish line to the pursuit of progress. to refuse the idea, hang on, to get stuck in the quicksand of the fear that this progress can go too far is ridiculous. It won't mean anything, it means the embracing of minorities and the changing power dynamics. That may scare some people, but if you look at the lesson of history, like the activists who stood up for gay rights in 1962 or 72, They were told they'd gone too far, but the arc of history says that it's not that we've gone too far, it's just that we have so, so far to go. And that's why I think you should reject this motion. Thank you.
