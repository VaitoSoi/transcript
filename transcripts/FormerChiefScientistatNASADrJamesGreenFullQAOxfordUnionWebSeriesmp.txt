 Good evening. I'm Molly Mantle, your president, and I'm delighted to be hosting Dr. Jim Green this evening. Dr. Jim Green was a NASA chief scientist through several of the agency's most significant missions. He oversaw the New Horizons flyby of Pluto, the dispatch of Messenger for Mercury, and Curiosity's successful landing on Mars. He's also advised the media on space, including in the 25th. 15 film The Motion. Jim, welcome. Molly, thanks so very much. It's really a great pleasure to be here. And, you know, I have many decades now working in NASA, and I realize when I step back and see what's happened over the last 40 years, there's been some astounding discoveries since I graduated from the University of Iowa. In fact, I really wish that I was just graduated. now because this next era of space discovery is going to be unbelievable. So let me mention a couple things that's happened over these last 40 years. For instance, I'm a heliophysicist by trade, specializing in magnetospheric physics, which means I never met a magnetic field I didn't like. So I've studied the sun and studied the solar interaction with the Earth, Aurora in particular, and aurora on other planets and how the sun and the sun's activity really bade the solar system and the effects that it has on our planets. And in these last 40 years, we've recognized we have not observed the tough sun that has happened in the past. The sun can produce enormous coronal mass ejections that we now, as we look at it, predict could wreak havoc with our power, grids and our technologies that we use today. So this is now giving us new awareness. Extreme space weather. Wow, what a topic. We also have completed the initial survey of our solar system from Mercury all the way out to Pluto. We know now that instead of what I was taught, that there are two basic areas of the solar system. There's the terrestrial planets and then those outer big gas giants, we now know there are three regions. And beyond the gas giants is a new region that is we call the Kuiper Belt, for which Pluto is a member, an icy world that's unbelievable from its shape and what it does and glaciers that move and it has its own atmosphere. And yet it is even smaller than our own moon. And we believe there are tens of thousands of hyper-belt objects beyond Pluto. So that initial survey has really opened our eyes as to seeing what terrestrial planets and how they change over time. We realize what's happened on Venus can happen on Earth. What's happening on Mars can happen on Earth. And these things are a really important to study. We also realize, and this is just in the last 20 or 25 years, that the Earth is in in a really bad orbit. It's not in a good orbit. And the reason why is we have a lot of leftover asteroids that we call near-earth objects that are flung out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter and move inward. And when they're inward, they can cross our orbit and impact our earth. And of course, cause mass extinctions. Sixty-five million years ago, the extinction of the dinosaurs was done by just a six-kilometer object. We now know there's about 60,000 objects across our orbit or our near-Earth asteroids that could come close to the Earth and impact it that we need to monitor over time. It's a revelation in our ability as a species on this planet to survive well into the future. And those are just some of the, a few of the things in our solar system. But of course, when I was at the University of Iowa, and I got an undergraduate degree in astronomy, we did not realize at that time, even have a hope of seeing planets around another star. And yet now we've cracked the ability to do that. We have found thousands, and we've done statistical analysis that indicates there are more planets in our Milky Way than there are star. And this has really created quite the revolution in our ability to begin the process in earnest of looking for life beyond Earth. Well, Molly, those are just a few of the topics that I have been a privilege to be involved in, done research in all those areas. And as I said, I wish I was just getting my PhD because I know exactly what I would do for the next 40 years. Well, that's quite a list for us to go into. I'm looking forward to it. And members do remember to leave questions in the chat below. When you got your PhD from Iowa, did you expect that you'd be working in NASA? Was that your intention when you began? Well, when I was at Iowa, James Van Allen was there. And indeed, he brought a significant part of the space program with him. when I started, they were on their 54th instrument. They were building instruments all over the place. And in fact, they built a couple satellites completely. And I got involved in building and participating in one called Hawkeye. Okay, just like our football team is the Hawkeyes. We had a spacecraft called Hawkeye. It was one of my favorite spacecraft. You put your arms around it. Okay, well, we launched it and we tracked it, we analyzed the data, and so I had a wonderful opportunity to talk about it at conferences all over the place. And so when I got my PhD, I actually had five job offers at a time when it was really difficult to even get one. And I chose indeed to go to NASA. And while you were working in the magnetospheric physics branch at NASA, you developed a space physics analysis network to improve access to data. When did you realize that access to data was a problem? Well, at Marshall Space Flight Center, they were building a group. They were bringing scientists together. We were beginning to plan experiments that we would do on the shuttle. The shuttle was being constructed. Marshall had a major part of that whole shuttle program. And so I was really lucky to be involved in that. So the data that we were involved in on several satellites, such as the Dynamics Explorer, we only had a cadre of a few scientists, and our co-investigators were spread all over the United States. And so given the opportunity, I started to connect them electronically. And we began to build this computer network. It was an unbelievable that by the end of 1980, we were doing email, file transfers, remote logons, sharing files, looking at looking at images that were coming from various analysis software. And I just had the opportunity to work with NASA and connect the rest of the centers, many of the other universities. In 1985, I had the opportunity to connect to the European Space Agency, where we did a number of joint projects together. And in 1987, we connected to the Japanese Space Agency. And then in 92, we were in Moscow. And so the network from a space agency perspective, you know, exploded. And of course, what happened to that is publicly the same thing was happening then in the 90s with the explosion of the Internet for the general public. It was just naturally the next step for which NASA and many of the space agencies really contributed. a lot of that early knowledge of how this worked. I wonder if you could speak a little to the benefits of international collaboration when it's come to your field of work. I think often people might be afraid of sharing data with other countries. Well, NASA has already picked a philosophy for which we want our data to be open and available as fast as we possibly can. Early on, it was very difficult to do that because as we were developing instruments, the instrument would give us a readout, but then that wouldn't come as a geophysical unit. It didn't give us a density or temperature or velocity. We had to calibrate it. And so it took us a while to really catch on that we needed to do a lot of that while we were developing the instruments such that when we flew, we could rapidly put the data into geophysical units and then make it available. We've been doing that for a long, long time now. And we like our space partners to do the same. In fact, in our international agreements, there's a lot of talk about data exchange and being able to get access free and open. And we've developed a variety of processes to do that, where we put a lot of online data systems that not only scientists can get to, but also the general public. So that's really gone very well. And you then became director of planetary science division at NASA a little later, and you oversaw several missions, the New Horizons probe to Pluto, the messenger probe to Mercury, the dawn probe to Vesta. Do you have a favorite probe? Well, I was head of planetary science for 12 years, where the average head of planetary science up until then, was like two and a half or three years. It's a very difficult job. I was tremendously blessed with a spectacular group of people all the way in NASA headquarters, but out in the centers. And we worked extremely well as a team, making mission after mission happened, doing absolutely unbelievable things. And of course, I really enjoy talking about the science that came out of our missions. So I would go to a lot of places, give public talks. And invariably, a young child would come up and ask the question, what is my favorite planet? And I would give them this answer. And so this is the answer to my favorite mission. And that is, I love all my children equally. Now, there's a reason for that. And that is, as we decide on a mission and put it together, it's very unique. A spacecraft that we sent to Mercury look completely different than the spacecraft we sent to Pluto. And so that means there's a lot of creativity that goes into developing the systems and the instruments that make the right measurements and then answering the science questions. And those science questions can be very different. And so enjoying every mission that we did because of the new objectives that they were completing. And it was just a joy. So I really have to tell you, I don't have a favorite. Perhaps we can go through some of the more famous missions one by one. But do you feel that the probes achieved what you intended them to? Yes. And every one of them to the, to the, mission have exceeded my expectations. And that's the way it should be. We actually decide on the science that we want to do that's well grounded in all the other observations that lead up to that next question we want to answer. We develop those missions. We put them together and then we go do that. But what we find in answering that one question, in fact, we may not have had the question right, but we always uncover new things that we had no clue about that we then need to investigate. And sometimes that mission can do it. Sometimes we say, well, we're going to have to build another mission. But that's the way it goes. That's how we build knowledge is one mission at a time. And what were the most surprising results you've got? Oh, you can just name an environment. You know, we are orbiting the moon with the lunar reconnaissance orbiter. And starting in 2009, we had a series of missions that went to the moon. Well, you'd think we knew everything about the moon, imaginable, for instance. But we were shocked to find out that we were clueless about what was happening in the polar caps of the moon. We now know there's an enormous amount of what we call volatiles. Now, that means gases that here on Earth go through phases, you know, like a vapor, a solid liquid. So that's water. It can also be ammonia, it can be carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide. These gases are trapped in these permanently shadowed regions on the moon. Now, on the South Pole and the North Pole, this is where impacts have occurred and the sun can't get into these craters, can't get into these holes. That means this material accumulates over billions of years and is a tremendous resource for us. We believe there's hundreds of millions of tons of water laying in these permanently shadowed regions. And that's why NASA has a human exploration program going to the moon itself. But I can go on to just about any of any other objects. And what would it mean for us if we did find that water on the moon? Ah, well, water is a resource of extreme importance because we can drink it. You know, water is water. H2O is water, whether it's on Earth or on the moon, okay? And in addition to that, we can tear it apart. We can have oxygen that we breathe. We can have oxygen and hydrogen that we could use for rocket fuel. So, So these volatiles are incredibly versatile, and we don't have to bring them because they're a resource that we can use. And you are speaking to us today, we initially contacted you to speak to us in our Mars debate. And although you can't travel, you very kindly came to speak to us anyway. In the beginning of your introduction, you spoke about life beyond Earth. I wonder if you could talk to us about what that would mean for where we are in getting to that discovery. Well, this is what I think is probably one of the most important driving questions that humans have. Are we alone? And of course, we're looking quite carefully in the solar system. Now, today we know at Mars, for instance, that there's no life on the surface. But it doesn't mean that life wasn't there in the past. And in fact, if we just look at Venus, Venus today, day is a planet about the size of the Earth. It's closer to the sun, therefore, it receives more sunlight, and it's gone through a major change in its climate. And we now have done the modeling to go back in time to realize Venus was a blue planet when Earth was a blue planet three and a half or four billion years ago. Mars was a blue planet when Earth was a blue planet. And so these three planets could have harbored life. In other words, Earth, 3.8 billion years ago when life started here, those were pretty much the conditions on Venus and Mars. And so our search for life, particularly in the solar system, is not just what we call extant life, current life today, but indeed past life. That's very important because as these planets evolved, the life goes with them. And as the climate change occurs on both Mars and Venus, they're no longer blue planets, the potential life that was there would have died. Is that our fate? Should we be considering what we need to do next? How do we use that knowledge? That's what really makes humans unique. We are the first species that have the ability to explore our solar system, both robotically, but also by and with humans. We're also the first species on this planet that plan ahead. I mean, we had architects that built structures. structures, cathedrals that they never saw completed. We plan for our future. And using the knowledge that we see in our solar system, we can look and see how can humans survive for long periods of time. I mean, I think biologically, the average species on Earth lasts maybe 10 or so millions of years. Is it possible for humans to last hundreds of millions of years? We We ask those questions. And the reason why we want to know the answer to those questions is we're also the first species on this planet that knows we can become extinct. And that knowledge is a driver for us. It enables us to think about how we can change our future in a way that allow us to survive, not only on this planet, but have the opportunity to move, live in with. work on other planetary bodies. And some people may worry that when governments fund space missions and other scientific projects along those lines, that it might be more of a vanity project than anything that could be actually useful to us on Earth. What would you say to that? Well, every mission I've ever seen at NASA and I've been involved in quite a few, I would never call them a vanity project because there are really solid reasons why we do these things. And as we do them, we learn an enormous amount. We build materials that are in hazardous areas. Those materials create spinoffs here on Earth, everything from the health things that we do on Space Station, monitoring our health, looking for what happens in space. Giving an example alone on Space Station, when Scott Kelly came back after being in space for about a year, his immune system was compromised. All right? Instead of a 40-year-old or so, his immune system was like he was 70 years old. And we don't know how that happened. And then what happened is body repaired it. And we don't know how that happened. And so he now, after a couple months, is back to a normal immune capability. Think about the research now that we've connected with NIH to continue that. If we can crack that, here's just one of the benefits. Between 17 to 20 percent of the elderly die of pneumonia because of a compromised immune system because we don't know how the body can repair the immune system. But by doing this fundamental research, it's a game changer. And that's because we have the ability to make these comparisons and then go do them. That's just the start of a huge number of things that we do that have major benefits here on Earth. And we've seen huge technological advances in our daily lives over the last few decades. We're talking earlier about GPS. I wonder if you could talk about NASA's role in developing those systems. Well, GPS was actually implemented by another agency, but the fundamental physics in some of the early demonstrations of how one would use signals from spacecraft to determine your location on Earth was actually pioneered by NASA. Now, in addition to that, I'm sure we all have cell phones of some sort. The cameras on our cell phones is a real miracle, and they're only getting better. But that whole process started because NASA needed the ability to miniaturize its imagers and take higher and higher resolution images that allow us then to interpret that data. So everything from the technologies we use routinely in geolocating, you know, farmers use that to farm their land with perfect rows, maximizing their crop production. you know, the weather predictions. You know, NASA builds spacecraft for NOAA and turns them over to NOAA that then does the global weather. With ISA also doing the same thing with many of its spacecraft, many of the agencies are doing that. You don't realize what it was like, you know, prior to the space age when you didn't really have a good idea as to how the weather was changing, how extreme the weather could be. and the fact that you needed to move out of the way of huge storms that could develop so easily. We now have that ability, and that ability is because we are in space. In your role as Director of the Planetary Science Division, you were also a spokesperson for NASA. What do you feel the most important factors in effective scientific communication to the general public? Well, we must be honest about what we find. We must be used the highest level of integrity. I find that NASA scientists do that. As chief scientist, one of the roles was to ensure that NASA integrity is maintained throughout the agencies. But the key to that is to try to communicate as often as, as we can. I have seen an explosion of social media activity for which we need to be part of that. We need to continue to tell the public what they're getting from the space program. And that includes in America in particular that fund us. We are an agency under the executive branch funded completely by the public in the United States, which we are grateful, grateful for, and we want to return that value. I want them to see the value they get for their money. And do you feel that social media will help scientific communication, or do you feel that it will spread more misinformation? Well, social media does have the opportunity to do both. NASA's involved in social media because indeed it can spread the right message. I think just because there are other things going on is not going to deter NASA from getting involved and having that information to the public who needs it and wants it and we want to provide it. Do you believe that the general public trust scientists less than they did 20 years ago? Oh, that's a good question. I have no real insight in that. However, I will say I think the general public now is far more sensitive about scientific discoveries, who's making those scientific discoveries, what those claims are, and how they affect their life. I think we also, as scientists, haven't necessarily done a great job in talking about how difficult sometimes science is. We have a certain process that we use. We don't talk about the process of science. We talk about the end result, but that end result is never precise. There are always variations. There's always changes. There's always perhaps caveats. It's very difficult to then explain those. So that becomes very esoteric sometimes. But we have to keep trying. We have have to be able to say, here's what we know now. It may change based on these things, but we know we need more data. And then we will tell you what we find out in the light of this new data. And you've had many roles in your career as a scientist. Is there any that you look back at with particular fondness? Oh, yeah. I have been in just about every position. you know, you can imagine from involved in instruments to analyzing data to calibrating instruments to. I was even involved in human exploration program. While I was at Marshall Space Flight Center, Marshall Space Flight Center invented the process of creating a very large tank of water that then they would submerge space experiments in and then take astronauts in space suits and engineers also in. spacesuits, put weights on them, and then dump them in the water, make them neutrally buoyant, and practice their extra vehicular activities, or what we call EVAs. So I got involved in that. I ended up being a safety diver in the neutral buoyancy tank. I made about 150 dives. I really got involved in what the humans were doing. We were repairing Hubble telescope, and we were practicing it in a tank of water. We were repairing the solar max. maximum mission, a huge telescope, you know, with backpacks on to go hunt down the spacecraft and bring it over to the shuttle bay. We were building parts of the space station. I mean, some of the things that we did in the tank was just absolutely spectacular. We practice it such that we then figure out what to avoid in terms of problems, how to fix them on Earth before you launch in space. And then we had developed a process for which then the astronauts could get out in space and do the work as efficiently and effectively as possible. And it's worked out tremendously well. So I have enjoyed an enormous number of things in my career. And speaking of the humans, do you think that we will be able to go into space anytime soon? Yes. In fact, you may be referring to perhaps the general. public, you know, and indeed, I think that's very possible. And it just comes from the explosion of activities that's going on in the commercial sector. You know, NASA in 2005 or so started funding a lot of the commercial sector organizations, including SpaceX, Blue Origin, others, to be able to develop a capability that NASA could just turn over. like rockets going to low Earth orbit, for instance, supplying material to space station, bringing astronauts back and forth. And we're seeing that. Now, what the commercial groups have done is they've started that process of launching, you know, the general public, you know, citizen astronauts that are going into space, right? You know, SpaceX has launched a number of astronauts that have gone around the world several times, in an orbit that's like 90 minutes, you can go around the entire world. This brings up new concepts of travel. The ability in the future for which humans may be launched in space, go halfway around the world, and land in about 45 or 50 minutes. Okay, that might be the new way we travel around the world and do it fast. That's an exciting new era that we have ahead of us. And we've spoken a bit about climate change and there's also obviously other effects which we see with humans beginning space exploration like space rubble. Do you think that we'll reach a point where space exploration just becomes too destructive? I don't, although there are some things that we need to do better. We launch a lot of spacecraft in low Earth orbit. And indeed, it's gotten crowded. I mean, we've launched probably 9,000 or so spacecraft since the beginning of the space program. And in the matter of the next 10 years or less, we're going to launch 40,000. All right. So it's going to get, if you think it's crowded now, it's going to only get worse. Now, out of that, there's only about a couple thousand spacecraft that are currently up and operational performing their jobs. I mean, these things wear out. your car wears out, your dishwasher wears out. Well, spacecraft wear out too. There's only so much we can do. So we now are moving into an era where we need to be, each of the space agencies need to be mindful that they, through an end of mission plan, dispose of their spacecraft, have enough resources to move it out of the way or deorbit it or bring it back, clearing the way for other missions to end up in those orbits. That's being discussed intently, internationally, and I think it's in everyone's best interest that we work together and cooperate in that manner. And then, of course, there are some new ideas about going up and removing that debris by hunting down spacecraft that are derelict, connecting to them, grappling them in some method or way, and then deorbiting them. So many of these ideas, I think, will see come to fruition over the next several years. And with that, that enables us to all use and have the benefits of space missions for their countries and for the livelihood of their people. And that's for the benefit of mankind. And the general public's perception of space is often shaped by. media, like film and TV. In 2015, you were instrumental in NASA's involvement in the production of the film The Martian. Can you tell us about that experience? Yeah, I was really privileged to be involved in that. Ridley Scott had called NASA headquarters and said, I want to talk to somebody that knows something about Mars. And so they turned to me. And after spending about an hour on the phone with Ridley and his team, I realized immediately he was trying to develop a film that is as realistic look and feel about Mars as possible. And he sent me the script. I hadn't read the book The Martian by Andy Weir, but that weekend, I read the script and the book, you know, took a, you know, just did nothing but read. And on Monday went back in the NASA headquarters and they said, well, Jim, what do you think? I said, we need to help Ridley anyway. We can. to provide him the information he needs because this is really a great, hard science fiction film, which means it builds on a lot of scientific fact, not completely, but a lot of scientific fact that is important to tell the public and to show what it would be like. And so they said, great, you're the lead. And so I had then took on the job of interfacing with NASA, bringing people together, connecting with Ridley. They would send me a set of questions every week. I'd be answering some and farming out others. And then it was, you know, and then finally, after four or so months of doing that, then everything stopped. And off they go to make the film. And then the next thing I knew I got invited to go see some of the early. versions of it where some of the CGI and some of the things hadn't been completed. And then I got to go to the Toronto Film Festival where it was shown for the first time. And I met more of the cast. I met Matt Damon there and some of the others who I hadn't met before. And it just was a blast. It was quite rewarding because the film is quite realistic in terms of its look and feel. We worked really hard to be able to provide Ridley and his team with what he needed to make that happen. And coming more recently, there was an article in the New York Times in January mentioning the cold scale, which you developed as a methodological approach to looking for life. Could you explain to those viewers who maybe aren't familiar how the cold scale works and why it's important? Yeah. So I proposed to the scientific community that we needed to do. do a better job of communicating our results on the search for life. And to do that, I created a sample scale on the confidence of life detection. So NASA loves acronym, and I love NASA. So cold stands for confidence of life detection. And that scale is from one to seven. If you're on the cold scale of you have found it, all right. But if you find a biosignature that may be generated abiotically, you really start out at a level we call cold one. Now, that's important to communicate because that means you have to build up on each and every one of these observations. So let me give you an example. Let's say an astronomer observes a planet. And that planet, it is about the size of the earth. Okay, so that's a good start. It's at a location where it's at the edge of the habitable zone. That means the area where it gets enough light like Earth does that could harbor life. And then the discovery is they find oxygen in the atmosphere. What happens next is talking to the public about it in the same way I described it kind of means, it could mean that oh well there must be some sort of life on the surface like plants breathing in CO2 generating the oxygen so maybe this is a habitable world and the problem is we have that planet we know what that planet is that planet is Venus it's right at the edge of the habitable zone it's about the size of the earth and it is oxygen in its upper atmosphere and I can guarantee you because the surface is hot enough to melt that there's no plant life or no life on the surface of Venus. Okay? So that that extrapolation is too great. So that observation would be a cold level one. So let's not get excited yet. We need to do a lot more research before we can say that planet's got life. And that's what we need to relay to the public. And during your time at NASA in your early years, you want two important awards, the Arthur S. Fleming Award for Outstanding Individuals Individuals Individuals Individuals Individuals Individuals Data Management. What was that like for you? Well, the Arthur C. Fleming Award was quite a, well, everything was been quite a surprise for me. I was being recognized for developing NASA's first foray into the internet, providing a huge access to scientists not only in this country, but in some of the other space agencies. And that was just a wonderful honor. And then international recognition, like the Katani Prize for all the data, open data, you know, that's a natural consequence of a network, the ability to then put data that we have locked on magnetic tapes into systems. that then are connected to networks that allow people to get access to it. And so it just sort of built on each other. And so I've been really blessed by the recognition I've gotten in all those areas and others. Well, I'm keen to make sure that we leave time for audience questions. Do leave your questions in the Q&A function, the Zoom chat below. We'll start with a question from Peter T says NASA announced yesterday that the Internet National Space Station will be decommissioned in 2030. What do you see as future for genuine international cooperation to create a new space station? Or do you see individual countries or private individuals such as Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos creating their own private ones? Yeah, the answer to that question, I think, is yes. So those are indeed the possibilities. You know, Space Station has been in space for 20 years. Your audience that are 20-year-old or younger, they have lived their whole life with somebody orbiting overhead, living and working in the beautiful space station that's being built. And of course, as we talked about earlier, things that we build and put into space don't always last forever. They wear out. And that includes the space station, too. We're happy to say that we're able to continue repairs, continue working, continue to develop, and working hard to then allow the space station to last for another eight years. But it also, I think, raises a flag of urgency. Let's continue on doing fabulous science, but doing the top science that requires us to be in space, looking at microgravity. the effects on the body, looking at how we develop materials, how we do a whole variety of research in a plant life, growing plants in space, and, you know, the ability to grow them vertically, you know, like we have to in space versus flat on the ground that we do here on Earth. New ideas and new techniques. We're learning those things in space that we then apply here on Earth. So focusing our effort to do the top things is very important. But what's the next step? Our space station is important. Should industry get involved? Do companies want to go and develop things in space that they can use for new markets? I know the ability to develop skin mats are really good in orbit that then can be used for burn victims. There's so many things, like there's so many medical applications that I think many commercial groups would like to connect with others and be able to connect with other nations that perceive that the next big step would be to build a similar system or better systems in different ways and then do that research in low Earth orbit in space. So I think, well, once again, you know, I don't have my crystal ball here to tell you how that will evolve. But there's so many players now involved that I think it'll be a really exciting time to see what happens. Do you worry that political divisions will prevent scientists from working together internationally? Well, what I've seen since I was a scientist at the University of Iowa, even in the 70s and then as a NASA scientist in the 80s, scientists from different countries with major. political differences, worked together just fine. In 1988, I went to Moscow in the former Soviet Union and was involved in two conferences back-to-back. I was there two whole weeks. And it was a wonderful exchange with our Russian colleagues and others in many of those European countries that came to those conferences. So international collaboration has really been an important hallmark. In fact, you know, what we're doing on Space Station, where there are many people from different countries, different cultures, living and working together, and they do so well that to me, you know, the International Space Station should get a Nobel Peace Prize for the It is the neutral ground where we can come together, work in the common cause of improving and helping humanity, no matter what country you're from. And they do that and do that really well. And Ruth asks, what role do you see NASA playing in mitigating climate change or finding solutions in this area? I think what a lot of people don't realize is how we got to the point of understanding, climate change. It really comes from NASA. We started with our NASA scientists looking at Venus in the 70s and into the 80s. How come Venus is so hot? And we uncovered that through running in supercomputers are huge models that the climate is in a runaway greenhouse driven by huge amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere. Those same climate scientists took their codes and brought them to Earth and then begin to do global circulation models. But once they got it right and once they got the physics in, then they could see how the climate, how the weather is, changing in the weather, climate is the overall average of long-term weather activity and how those changes occur. We then have the opportunity to run the models forward, to be able in a supercomputer to add additional CO2 and see what happens. And now we recognize and had stated clearly even in the in the 90s that as CO2 increases, the planet will get warmer. And then what are the effects of warming? Well, the polar caps will melt. That water dumps fresh water into the ocean. That changes the currents. That changes so many aspects of our daily weather that in the long run, climate change is occurring. Well, as a planetary scientist, I realize that the climate has done nothing but change over the last four and a half billion years. And so it's not the fact that climate is changing, more so than the rate of change, more so than the fact that the normal change in the climate is being superseded by a faster rate of change. And that is due to the biology that's on this planet that then is affecting our climate. So NASA had already been part of this, and we're going well into the future. So the huge number of observations of the Earth that are being made for scientific research in the United States is done by NASA. We have 23 or 24 missions up and running right now that measure all kinds of things from sea surface height to wind velocities, to looking at the intensity of hurricanes, looking at phytoplankton in the ocean, determining, you know, what the basic food source is for life in the ocean. So there's so many aspects of global observations that we make that's been tremendously productive. And we're going to continue to do that and continue to run our supercomputers and our models as things change so that we can predict the future to the best of our ability. And we have two anonymous questions about sort of privatization of space exploration. and the space race, do you think that we need a new space race to make significant technological progress and do you support increased privatization of the space industry? So if I look back in my history, indeed, it's clear that we had a space race in the 60s with the former Soviet Union. And then with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, the question comes up is, well, do we need space? Well, by that time, it became so obvious that our ability in space is helping humans survive, the ability to look down and look at a country's diseased and healthy crops, understand what's being grown and determined if you're going to, at the end of the season, export or import. space provides so many opportunities to do that, that NASA was here to stay. We didn't go through a period of being dismantled. And so I think the concept that we need a space race isn't viable. If there is one that happens in the future, okay. I would prefer we don't do that. I'd prefer that we move more into the area of working cooperatively together. And I think Space Station forms that model of where we come together and work together. By learning to live and work together, we then understand different points of view and we become tolerant of other cultures and religions. And that's critical for us as humans to be able to do that. And there's no reason why we can't. Now, relative to the commercial environment, this to me is, once again, a really important step. NASA helped start that in the early 2000s. We're seeing some of the benefits of that. NASA has turned over a lot of the launch capability to those commercial entities to get supplies and astronauts up to space station. But also, it enables us then to turn our attention elsewhere to then move out from low earth orbit, learn to live and work on a planetary surface by starting to do that at the moon and then go on to Mars. So we have just a tremendously important future. And the commercial entities then can recognize all the great stuff that's happening in orbit and leverage that as they need to. And I think we mentioned one particular aspect of actually moving from one on the globe to another in such an easy way by going into orbit and coming down somewhere else. So I think these are all possible things in the future, and I'm delighted with how the commercial sector is evolving. And Annie asked what types of scientists are most in demand by NASA at the moment? Oh, wow, that's a great question. And I would say all types. I mean, you know, we like everything from chemistry. to biologists. And I'm not just practical chemists, pharmaceuticals. When we go to the moon, we can't take a drugstore with us or Mars even. What are the things, what are the basic things that we need for life to survive under various conditions, under harsh conditions, and then be able to develop the infrastructure necessary to do that? Every pound we take into space, we can't throw away. It's not like we're going to go to the moon and there'll be a big crater and that'll be our dump yard. That's not going to happen. We have to learn to use material over and over again. The concept of sustainability is central to exploring space. Well, guess what? It's essential that we start doing more of that here on Earth. All right, we have limited resources. We want to preserve those. And there's a number of ways that will learn from a lot of our space activities how to be able to do that here on Earth. And reducing waste, I think, is one of those things that will also come about from the natural ability for us to move into the future in this manner. And B asks whether you think that the general public's interest in government space projects, in America has waned or increased since the moon landings? I think in the United States in particular, I can comment on. I think it's as strong as ever. I see through our social media, I see based on our press conferences, you know, when we landed curiosity on the surface of Mars, one of the things that I wanted to do is head of planetary, was to take the general public with us. You know, you're going to be in the control room. You're going to be seeing what we see. And if that thing crashes, everyone will know it exactly when we know it. Okay. But it didn't. It landed beautifully. And, you know, and the same thing with Percy. You know, perseverance now is also on the service of our. Same thing with our helicopter. We're flying a helicopter on another planet. How cool is that? So I think the more the public realizes what we do, the more excited they can become, it's very inspirational, but it's also very practical. And we as at NASA have to have to be able to take the time to explain not only what we're doing and share that excitement, but talk about the practical aspects of it too. So I think the general public in the United States is still highly favorable for NASA to keep moving on. Keep doing what we're doing. And Oscar asks, what are the largest space science challenges for? the next century? I think we're going to be able to answer, are we alone? And I think we're not very far away from finding that answer. I hope to be alive when we do that. And I think we're making exciting discoveries in that area. I also think as we move to that next big step of having humans go to the moon, that we'll see some tremendous advancements in development of habitats, our ability to live and work on a lunar surface, the resources that we will find there. What's laying on the surface of the moon are impacts from asteroids, from a lot of these near-Earth objects that hit the moon that I talked about earlier. In fact, for every crater on the moon, there's been 20 that have hit the Earth. The earth has gobbled them up and destroyed the features of craters because of our biosphere. But on the moon, that material is laying on the surface. And some of it are platinum group metals and many other resources. So I think there's huge advances in off-planet manufacturing and development that is just around the corner. So after, in fact, this year we're going to launch our first space launch system designed to go around the moon and come back uncrewed. And then we'll learn from that. And then within another year or two, we'll launch the second Artemis mission that will be crude going around the moon and back. And then the third mission, the third Artemis mission will land astronauts on the south pole of the moon. And indeed, we want the first woman on the moon to be the next one that steps off the Artemis Three lander. So we've got some tremendously exciting times ahead of us, just in the matter of in the next several years. Well, we have time for one final question, which is the question we ask all of our speakers. If you could have our audience today, take one thing away to think about for this week. What would that be? Wow. Well, there's so many things. I hope they get an appreciation for the enormous new knowledge we've obtained by moving into space. As I talked earlier when we opened up about understanding how severe solar storms can be, understanding the problem with near-Earth objects and what we need to do to defend this planet, understanding that we're really teasing apart all the physical. that it takes to understand how our climate changes and the evolution of this planet and be able to compare that with what's happened on other planets. So all those things are new just in the last couple decades, and that knowledge is being increased at an enormous rate. So I hope they will take on the challenge of staying in tune with what's happening in space, not only at the UK Space Agency, the European Space Agency, NASA, the Japanese Space Agency, all the new space agencies that are making fabulous discoveries, and come with us on this journey to explore our solar system, our planet, and the universe. Well, Jim, thank you so much. It's been a pleasure to hear from you, and we hope that we can host you in person when the COVID restrictions ease. Thank you all for joining us. Thank you so very much. I would be delighted to stop by. Thank you and have a good evening.
