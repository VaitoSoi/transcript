 Mr. President, Oxford Union guests, thank you for inviting me to do what I've been doing for the U.S. military and for my country for 21 and a half years, just in a different form now. In a way, this is actually much easier than I thought it was going to be. My colleagues helped me make the case for why the American Dream is not a nightmare. We had an over-the-top attack that all the ills of the world are on U.S. shoulders didn't really make that much sense. Sir, I want to thank you for the passion you showed, and frankly, I hope I'm not mis-step, mischaracterizing this, but the love of country as imperfect as it is, I sensed that. So I want to thank you for that. I also want to thank you because you share a lot of the same sentiments. Country is not perfect, but this is a viable dream for the vast majority, of Americans. My case is going to be simply that you have not met the threshold anywhere near it. The terms that have been used in this case are very stark. There is no ambiguity. Sir, you said that there is no such thing as an American dream. It never existed. How do we have a dream turning into a nightmare? It doesn't make sense. A nightmare evolves out of something that didn't exist. It's a troubling notion to me. I think you're right in assessing that we have many shortfalls and we have not arrived at our more perfect union. But there is a dream, and I'll tell you about that dream because I've lived that dream. My family experienced that dream when we came to the United States. For me, it's quite personal. My family emigrated to the United States in 1979. We fled as refugees, where pollution, from the Soviet Union. My father at the age of 47 uprooted his family. We had just lost my mother to cancer. One of the reasons he wanted to come to the United States is because the medical technology was much better that it was in the Soviet Union. There was the prospect of saving her. I wasn't able to leave in time. But he also sensed something deeper that his children were not going to have the same opportunities he did. We were a Jewish family and there was deep rampant anti-semitism, and although he managed to penetrate some of that, he knew that that wasn't going to be the same case for us. And he also was dissatisfied, to say the least, with the Soviet Union, this socialist dream, the promise of communism, evolving into communism, that could never materialize, because in certain ways it's against human nature, or at least we haven't evolved to that point. Maybe at some point in the future, you know, when capitalism in this imagined world has proven faulty, and we moved to some sort of other means, then we could discuss this, but it's all kind of conceptual ivory palace discussions because there's nothing like this. So I think to me, this is a very, very simple proposition. This is the proposition of thousands, millions, billions of people aspiring to have what we have in the United States. Come to the United States, those that are fortunate, either born there or come to the United States, try to build their American dream. They come with the aspiration that I think our founding fathers had when they came to the United States to realize something that may not exist yet but has every prospect of materializing in a country like the United States. there are a few places like it. I've served in combat. I've served in the Russian Federation under the watchful eyes of the security services there. I've worked diligently to try to keep my country safe and frankly out of war with the Russian Federation, something that I foresaw happening a long, long time ago. And we have it probably better than any other place, just about any other place in the world. Are we? perfect, no. You could call us a nightmare, maybe justifiably, during the Civil War, where we still had slavery and the country was being torn apart with half the country fighting for liberty or the aspiration of liberty for all. Maybe that wasn't the initial mindset, but that's where we ended up. You could say that the American dream was a nightmare in the 1930s when we were isolationist, when we failed to end up. We failed to end up. We were the war on the side of our allies and fight fascism, defend, liberate people that were, my parts of my ancestors that didn't survive the Holocaust. Maybe that was when we were a nightmare. Maybe it was the civil war. We were a nightmare because we had violence in the streets as people struggled for freedom and there was a violent suppression of that population. Maybe that's when we were a nightmare. Maybe we were a nightmare when in an existential threat, crisis against communism, we fought with every tool at our disposal to ensure that the population, that the American population and that Western civilization would not be subsumed, would not be defeated by a malignant, barbarous, anti-human values regime in the form of this Soviet Union. Maybe that's when we were a nightmare. I'm having a hard time kind of understanding this whole proposition. Are we talking about the U.S. in the past when we fell short, as we're a developing enterprise? Is it a proposition about where we fell short historically as we made progress, trying to be more inclusive, aspiring to be that more perfect union with our setbacks? Sometimes two steps forward, two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it's two steps back. I think most of the people in this room would agree that under the Trump administration, we had some significant setbacks. I'd say this past, yeah, I could speak about that one in detail, all right? This may be, I think this is actually, frankly, maybe a little bit more nerve-wracking than testifying in front of Congress. But in fact, we are imperfect, but we've always, the arc of history has bent towards justice. I believe that. I see it happening. The fact is that we are continuing to move forward. I think the elections we had on Tuesday are somewhat indicative of that. There was a broad rejection of extremism. Did it sweep across the entire country? No, but we held the line for democracy. And I think that's the fact that there's a recognition that democracy was in peril. People shook off their apathy, their complacency, and showed up to defend democracy, to defend our hopes for for a more perfect union. So this proposition of the American dream becoming a nightmare, maybe you're right. Maybe it was something closer to a nightmare in the past. But as we see this country certainly over the course of my lifetime, over the course of the last generation or two, this is a country that's become more inclusive, that's expanded rights, whether that's for the principle, the simple, principle of two people that love each other, regardless who they might be, are allowed to marry. That's a right that wasn't enjoyed in the past. This is the trajectory of our country. We're moving in that direction. Yes, there's rampant, the inequality is deeply troubling. And it probably counts for a lot of the issues that we're seeing within U.S. society. I think that there are efforts underway to try to address those issues. It's probably going to to be a challenge as it has been at every one of those points I mentioned in the past. Whether it's the Civil War expanding rights, whether it's the right for women to vote, whether it's coming in to defend the world against fascism and that's... Table that one until... There'll be a minute for a Q&A. I think I'm going to run out of material here shortly. So I think at one point you might be able to say that. Although again, maybe there wasn't a dream. and if there wasn't a dream, there can't be a nightmare. I think simply put, it's not as bad as our colleague said. It never will be. You can't hang everything that all the ills of this world on the U.S. shoulders. Just because we happen to be the biggest country, the most innovative country, the biggest country is in terms of economics, the most innovative country and frankly a country that's there, when things need to happen, the U.S. shows up. Ask the Ukrainians who are on freedom's frontier right now that are defending the world. Who showed up to support Ukraine? Yes, it's been the European Union NATO, but it's been the U.S. and the lead. Whether it's budgetary support, whether it's the resources that Ukraine needs to hold back this newest fascist regime that's... Stand by. the newest regime, this newest fascist regime that looks to turn upside down the liberal order that's allowed the democratic world to prosper, and set the conditions for a much, much more challenging 21st century, not just for the U.S., for the United Kingdom, the European Union, and democracies at large. Let's think about that counterfactual. If the U.S. didn't show up, if the U.S. had maybe a second Trump admit, What would that look like? We could have ended up in a world where NATO was fractured, where the U.S. didn't show up for Ukraine, and Russia would have conquered Ukraine. What would that mean? That would mean an emboldened Iran. That would mean an emboldened China, potentially looking, eyeing Taiwan. And it's only because the U.S. was there taking a leadership role attempting to advance our common values, certainly the common values of the people in this room, but I think it's broader than that. I think it's the common values of humanity, imperfectly as it might be. If the U.S. wasn't there, what kind of world would that be? I could tell you what kind of world would be. That would be a world. That would be a nightmare world. That would be a world with the rules of the jungle, with a strong prey on the weak. that would be a world without rules. So I think we clearly understand that this proposition on the face of it just simply doesn't make sense. The U.S. has played too critical a role, and we do not want to live in a world where their American dream becomes a nightmare. Thank you.
