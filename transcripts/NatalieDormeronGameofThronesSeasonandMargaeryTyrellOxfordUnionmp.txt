 So let's move on to Game of Thrones. Tiny show, tiny show. No one watched it. I'm sure you're bored to death of talking about it. But had you read the Song of Ice and Fire book series before you auditioned for the role as Marjorie? No, I hasn't. And I, you know, I came in in the second season. So the phenomenon was nowhere near a phenomenon when I came on board that show. it was the next sort of like two, three years that it became what it became. And I don't think any of us really knew what it was until right in the zeitgeist of when we were in it. And then it was, you know, perfect for me because I left before the very end. Don't worry, we have questions on that coming. So I escaped that. I really, I really, I won the lottery. on that show. I got in, did five years work, left. And I chose not to read the books because I realized that Dan and David were going to go in a different direction. And there wasn't... Taking myself a heart here. I don't have to defend them anymore. They don't pay me anymore. And, you know, Marjorie wasn't a major character in the books. She wasn't fleshed out. George hadn't fleshed her out. I mean, that's literally what they said to me when they gave me the role. They were like, we don't know what to do with her. So you look like you have some ideas. So I was like, not really, but I'll do what you tell me to do. So, sorry, what was the question? Had you read the books before? I hadn't read the books. No. And I'm normally quite, and as you've just worked out from Anne Berlin or something, or, you know, I will do my due diligence and my research if I think it's appropriate. Sometimes it's an advantage not to, especially if it's a beloved, you know, especially if it's beloved text in another form. Have you since read the books? No. Well, they won't be finished rather than being finished badly. Well, I was going to say, is George finished them? I don't think George has finished them. So you didn't feel any additional pressure like you did with historical characters to fulfill a character that people have read the books and life? not because not out of lack of respect for the book acolytes, not out of a lack of respect, purely because I felt at that time it wouldn't help me do my job better. In fact, if anything, I thought it might undermine my process. So that's why I took that decision. Did you like the Marjorie that you ended up creating with Dan and do? Yeah, I mean, I felt like, I felt like, I felt, at the time, I felt like Marjorie was being willfully misunderstood and misinterpreted. But maybe that's just because I was so close to the characterization that, you know, of course I loved her. It's a very interesting one. We'll wait until that's open to the floor, I think, before I start making assumptions about what you all think. I think this question was asked at Charles last term. Who was the best to work with on the Saturday of Game of Thrones? Who was your favourite person to be in a scene with, or the person you looked at and thought, I wish Marjorie had a scene with them? Oh, well, I love Rory. I loved The Hound. And if I bumped into him at the airport, I was very happy. So I wish I could have had a scene with him. And then other than that, the most fun. I mean, I loved working with Jonathan as the Sparrow. I learned a lot because that's a man who has so many awards in so many different mediums that what he doesn't know isn't worth learning. He did a seminal Hamlet when he was younger. He's an incredible stage actor, and he's just done it. He's lived it, breathed it. Dame Diana is, you know, rig is rig, you know, so you're honored to be on screen with her. It was such an eclectic mix. The joy of the job was that you never quite knew who you were going to be opposite next season. You know, that was the joy of the job. And so it changed. It changed a year one year, you know. As well as people that you looked at and thought, I want to act alongside them, were there roles that you looked at and thought, oh God, I wish I was Dineris or I wish I was Cersi? No, I never. Yeah, Lena, yeah, no. No, because like I said to you, I had the best of both worlds. I could, if my role in Game of Thrones had been bigger, I would never have been able to go and do the younger games or you have to dedicate so much of your time to those more prevalent roles. So I had this beautiful, like, you know, I had this beautiful experience for three, four years where I was one on one of the most successful shows in television, but I also had six months of the year after go and pursue other jobs, be it stage or, you know, smaller projects. So I was literally grateful that the equation was so wonderful for me. Did that mean that after the years you spent on Game of Thrones it was difficult to move on? What do you mean? Was it sad when you realised that Marjor was dying? I was champing at a bit to get out, to be honest with you. Yeah, no. Please kill me off. Well, you know, I've said this in other interviews before. I'd asked Dan and David to do a stage play the year before, George Bernard Shaw, and it had overlapped with Game of Thrones shooting by like two, three days. And so because of the mechanics, as you rightly said, of that machine, the mechanics of that machine, the number of actors involved, the number of locations, I mean, there's just no way they're going to try and work out an actor's schedule for that show. So the answer was, no, you can't. And I was really quite upset. at the time and they phoned me and they said don't worry Nat we don't normally tell people this but you'll be free next year and I was like oh okay but it means I had the advantage over a lot of my colleagues that I sort of could start planning did you see colleagues sat in like a first reading of an episode and that would be when they realised that their character died or no because there would be a table read but that didn't always happen and not everyone could be there and invariably people would die later in later episodes in the show and people are reading that quietly in their bedroom so we didn't really see that is it a strange atmosphere to have so many people you work with for like Dame Dan for across several series and then suddenly you don't work with them anymore was that just part and parcel of the job of being an actor that you have kind of parcel of part and part and parcel, and it makes us sound a bit unfeeling or mercenary, but that's the job. It's the Trubodore lifestyle. It's the circus family. You go somewhere, you bond, you have an incredible time, there's ups, there's downs. It's a chapter in your life and you go on, you know, and that's whether it's, you know, an independent film, a TV show or stage. So, no. It's always sad, but you spend your life saying hello and goodbye to people, so I suppose you learn to get good at it. Or, you know, or you find the love of your life on a job. Obviously, Kit and Rose ended up together after Game of Thrones. David and I met each other on stage doing Venus and Fur, and now have a daughter and her life together. so you don't say goodbye to everyone. Do you have a favourite memory from Game of Thrones? Favorite memory? Sorry, it's a tough question. I mean, the purple wedding was, you know, we were all together as a cast for like four or five days in Croatia. It was like a big frat sorority union party. because so many of the scenes in GAT are two people talking or three people talking but normally just two people in a room and so on and so forth those unlikely couplings that the show was so very good at so for us all to be shooting a big party scene and to be you know there was like 10 or 12 lead characters all there we all had a fun week now I gather from your previous comments that you have seen the seasons after Marjorie's death And I'm not responsible for them. And don't worry about being polite. Charles Dance certainly wasn't. Oh, what did Charles say? You can watch it on our YouTube channel. Nice plug. But no, it was not polite. What did you think of season eight? Is it where you thought they were going? Do you think it's where they thought they were going? Huge disclaimers here. Okay. I think this is the perfect example of people... If the... If the IP does not... Sorry, you're not Oxford. I don't have to explain what IP is. If the intellectual... property is already there from start to finish, like we were talking about Lord of the Rings upstairs, then an awful lot of work has been done by Tolkien or Hemingway or Jane Austen or so many man-hours has been done in creating the structure of that story. And if it's a novel, it's been through its editors and its publishers, it's been refined and refined and refined and refined and you know or various versions of that the story has been stress tested if that story a three-act story from start to finish has already existed and is given an adaptation when you are watching shows and it's normally shows because a film script will be commissioned obviously having been fully written 100 pages, 110 pages, as a standard, 90 to 110 pages, depending. You know, you've got your three-act structure, start to finish, this is the film. They commissioned TV shows without always knowing what the ending is. You may have noticed. Sometimes they know what the first two seasons are, and sometimes they know what the first five seasons are. But I think, you know, what an audience doesn't always. understand is the number of cooks in the kitchen of the studio and what the writers are up at and the showrunners are up against. There are many, many layers of opinion. And not least actors, contracts, they want to get out of contracts. They've been doing this job for eight, nine years. They want to go and do something else. There's so many layers to the industry that the audience don't care. Of course you don't care about. And you shouldn't care about because you're just watching your story that you want to watch for escapism and to take you away. But there's elements of the business that get in the way, literally, you know, the price tag on people's contracts. And at the other end is, you know, those stories that have already been written by greats, there are a reason why those stories are great. And they've been fully thought out and fully rounded. David and Dan did not have that. I am defending them. Maybe it's just... Well, who has a better story than Brown the Broken? Maybe, maybe it's just maybe I don't, I empathize. I was disappointed. I was. But I also fully appreciate what they must have been up against. And I think it would have almost been an impossible job for everyone, for the majority of people to be satisfied. Because it was so beloved to that show and people bonded with their characters that they adored the most so intensely, which is when we're doing our job well. And it's what storytelling should be. It should be cathartic. It should transform, you know, your life momentarily and take you away. People are so emotionally invested in all that plethora. of characterisation, how were you ever, ever going to satisfy everyone? Or most people. I don't. It's really tough. Was that really dissatisfying answer? It dissatisfying answer. You can argue with me about it later. Has it changed your, has it sort of slightly stained your experience of the show in your knowing that all the characters you interacted with, you now know what the ending is? No. Stained. No. No, no, no, no, no. Because I was in there, I was in it, breathing it, doing what was right in that moment for my character at that moment. And like I said, the actor's job as a character, as to be, when playing a character and actually in your career should be to be in the moment. So when I was in the moment, I was having a, having a ball. And then I, you know, and then after that, I'm not the actor anymore. I join your ranks and I become the audience member and I'm detached from that. I don't equate those two emotions, they're separate identities.
