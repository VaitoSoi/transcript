 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm an economist, but I'm not a two-handed economist. I'm my one-handed economists, and I strongly believe that Western lenders are responsible for the plight of developing countries today. And I'm going to try and convince you why. The developing country world is in the midst of a debt crisis, the like of which has not been seen since the 1980s. Today, around 60% of the world's poorest countries are in the midst of a debt crisis or in high risk of it. 30 years ago, when we had the last high debt crisis, developing economies owed most of the foreign debt to governments, nearly all of whom were members of the Paris Club, which is an informal group of official creditors whose role is to find sustainable solutions through the debt challenges of developing countries. Not so today. At the end of 2020, low- and middle-income countries owed five times, five times as much of commercial lenders as the debt to bilateral official creditors. This year of the nearly $53 billion that low-income countries need to make in debt service payments on the public and publicly guaranteed debt, just five billion will be going to Paris Club creditors. The rest mostly to commercial creditors. Much of the debt of developing countries today involves variable rates, meaning they could write almost as suddenly as credit card debt. What should we care about the deaths of developing country governments? Well, sovereign debt defaults have huge catastrophic social economic costs. Some research shows that affected countries fell behind by a curative 8% of GDP as compared to a situation, but there was no debt default. Head-con poverty rates increased by 70%, a staggering 70%, one year after the default, compared to a no-default scenario, and there were declines in infant mortality and life-eaturned. expenditure as well. This implies that debt defaults reverse years of progress, years and decades of progress in economic social indicators and push the already poor citizens of low-income countries into further despair. Let us take a couple of examples of developing countries. You heard a lot examples today from the opposition. So let's have a few examples from the proposition. Think about Chad. Chad is a low-income country in Franco-Fone Africa. Chad is a per capita income income $700, $700, and a poverty rate of around 48%. Around 50% of Chad's external debt is owed to Western private lenders, a staggering 1318 million US dollars. Who does Chad owe its debt to? Western oil companies. These companies operate in Chad for their profits, which are then transferred to the country's origin, be the US, be the UK, or other Western countries. very little is left over who are citizens of Chad. Take another country in Africa, now in Anglophone Africa, South Sudan. South Sudan is one of the poorest and cost-effective countries and one of the most vulnerable to climate disaster risk. A per capita income $486 and a poverty rate of 82%. That's 4 out of 5 citizens in South Sudan live in poverty. Around a quarter of South Sudan is still debt is owed to Western lenders. For a country as poor South Sudan, and a significant part of the population facing large-scale food in security at the moment because of the European crisis, it can hardly make its payments to Western lenders for his debt. Who are responsible to the plight of this and other developing countries? Ladies and gentlemen, I propose the root cause of the plight are the greedy practices of Western lenders. Well, China's often blamed, and we heard a lot of China, actually, from the opposition for blamed by Western media and governments for the debt problems or developing countries, African governments owe three times, three times more debt to Western banks, asset managers, and all traders, and none of them are of Chinese origin. Private creditors lend to the poorest country in the world at often high interest rates and show little compassion in holding the governments of living countries into account to make sure their loans are repaid. This is inspired to the widespread distress that we've seen in the COVID-19 pandemic aftermath and the soaring food and energy prices in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. Many of these debts private lenders are under jurisdiction of the UK with over 90% of sub-Saharan African government bonds owed under English law. You may ask how Western lenders directly responsible would apply to developing countries, we've heard about cause and effect today, when the debt problems can be attributed to other causes as well. Take another example of a country in southern Africa was a week. In 2016, the discovery of previously undisclosed, deaths, cruelly halted Mozambique's development trajectory. Mozambique was at that time with the world's 10 fastest growing economies for two decades. It was a darling of donors and a destination for a 10 to 15 percent of total foreign deteriorated investment inflows into sub-south Africa. It all came to a halt for the revelation of several state bank hidden loans guaranteed without parliamentary approval. The loans were to build shipyards, developed tuna fishing, police the coast, and the financing came from three major banks, 12 which are Western banks, Western lenders. Some 1.3 billion the loans were undisclosed until the international media reported on them in 2018. The hidden loans crisis plunged Mozambique into a protracted economic downturn. With economic growth halving from 7.7% in 2016 to 3.3% in 2016 to 2019. Foreign direct investment dried up as international investors lost confidence. As the hidden libraries came to light, Mozambique's external debt and publicly-garded debt increased for 61% GDP in 2016 to 104% in 2018. What happened? You know the story. The test surveys from Mozambique was simply too high to carry, and Mozambique defaulted on its loans in 2016. The Mozambican example shows clearly how Western lenders can take advantage of low-income companies, weak institutions, which was true. In Mozambique, had weak institutions. And in and collusion with the corrupt elite push a country into precarious economic situation which has not been able to recover as yet. As Western Central Banks tightened monetary policy, interest rates have risen by average Fiat and 5.7 percentage. For low-income countries, interestingly, the U.S., interest rate increases around 2.2% percent of points as of now. Many of the developing countries which are providing data on average interest rate, data on average interest rates, what we see is a huge increase in this investment that has happened in the last year or so. Ukraine, for example, has seen its cost of its new borrowing rights from 10% to 46% since the start of 2022. On average, around 18% of public revenue of low-income countries is going to pay interest payments for external debt, and most of them, of course, are to invest in lenders. Why does it matter? A $1 increase in interest payments, to Western lenders in plus a $1.00 decrease in crucial social expenditures in developing countries that they have to make. But there's critical, sorry, go on. Yes, please. Go ahead. The future cases that you mentioned, Cambodia and India, all of them also related from a huge number of quadru. So I think if we bought up with all the investment on the loan. Did you notice I did not mention the World Bank here at all? So that's important to keep in mind. I do differentiate the World Bank and the IMF from private heritage. there's a difference there. So thank you for that point, and I'm glad you read the book. So if you think about the situation now, imagine a low-income country, what do they need to do? Fund health, fund education, for social protection, what's happening? What they're really doing now is they're using the hardened taxes they collect from their own citizens to pay off Western lenders. That's what's happening right now. It's true to say that you're seeing a growing realization among Western governments, China and multilateral institutions to do something tangible to lessen the dead burden of developing countries. And I would certainly say that the bank and the IMF are also part of the discussion. For example, official bilateral creditors reschedule USD 13 billion in principal repayments, giving breathing space low-income countries between May 2020 and December 2021. That was a very important step. Yet only one private lender agreed to take part in this initiative. Yes, only one private lender. And we have to understand that today we don't have the Bob Geldof's and the bonus to speak on behalf of the European countries as they did 30, 40 years back. And we need to understand that Western lenders, back-packed-grading agencies, are using fear-mongering tactics to stop their countries pay off the interest payments. And therefore, I would like to argue that it is time that we hold the Western lenders we don't let them off the hook. And we need to make a start in this chamber to vote for the motion that Western lenders are responsible to the plight of developing countries. Thank you.
