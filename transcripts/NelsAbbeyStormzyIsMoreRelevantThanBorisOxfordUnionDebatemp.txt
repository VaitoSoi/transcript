 I'd like to look to Nels Abbe to close the case for the proposition tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you to Jasmine, Mr. Montgomery. dear gentleman over here and to the opposition for such a very, very really lively and amazing debate so far this evening. I'm going to start off by doing something I think might be somewhat unusual in the history of the Oxford Union. And before I do it, I'm going to apologise to the President and to Nile. For I'm going to start off this evening by reaffirming one of the most vicious of Nigerian stereotypes, which the three of the share our heritage in Nigeria, I can start off by bribing everybody. And I'm going to do it in the most classic way. If you're a business student, you might want to pay significant attention to this because you're going to learn a lot about how the business world really works. In this brown envelope, ladies and gentlemen, is a bribe that's going to go around to all of you this evening. So the sweet content of this brown envelope, I hope, carries the motion for us. So are we ready for this? I'm just going to take one of the bribes each to greet. you'll think, let me just pass it around and can you pass this round over here and just pass it around to everybody through the room so everybody could take a quick look through. Don't hog it. Share the salt. Right. Ladies and gentlemen, it will get to you eventually as often, as the seeds of corruption often in due and as they often have within British history. What you're looking at, ladies and gentlemen in front of you are two stills. from Stormsie's video from a video by Stormsy called Blinded by Your Grace which was a Christian song, a really touching one. But the thing that really spoke to me about those two images in front of you and it will be shared with the people at home too was that that really spoke to much more than just a music video or anything else. It spoke to our future. In the pictures you're seeing in front of you are our tomorrow. you're seeing young working class people huddled together in common purpose in love signalling to some degree in prayer it's something in terms of working class people is an image of working class people that you often don't really see reflected in media or reflecting anywhere else it shows them all their creed all their colours and everything else all stood together and surrounding Stormsy and at one of the pictures they're bowing their heads together. There's something... I'll be nice. If you really think working-class people surrounding Stormzy really defines the religious, then what do you think about the red wall, the same working-class people who are working for the Tory party for the same seat which was Johnson is presenting today? It's a very good point. The gentleman makes a very good point. The gentleman made his question is about the working class, the red wall, which is a predominantly Labour voting block within the north of England, I believe in North England, that switched from voting for the Labour Party to voting for the Conservative Party in 2019 election, and they did so principally for one reason, which was for Brexit. They were voting because they wanted to get Brexit done, and Boris Johnson gave them a simple pitch, which was, it's fair. The vote was made, it's fair, off they go. The Labour Party fumbled the bag on that one a little bit. But back to the point about these two pictures I've handed around to you, this bride, I really and truly do believe that it says something fundamentally about the power and the prestige of Stormsy and his relevance within our society and how he's helping shake the society. And I think that's a very, very important thing, because if we're going to have a better and brighter future, it has to be united. It has to be one in which the United Kingdom is truly united. And that is something that I believe Stormsy is doing a better job at than Boris Johnson ever has. Stormsy is a general in the war against poverty in this society. Yes, he's rich, but he gives back to try and help people out. Boris Johnson is a field marshal in the culture wars that seeks to divide working people and build an electoral base for himself. I've gone a bit too deep pretty soon also. I'll live it things up a little bit or so. But the image I passed around, I really and truly do believe that that's it. That's what we will. all aspire to, and a sign of all of us working together, coming together, a truly united kingdom. And it's not a king or a queen that's brought us together in that way. It's certainly not a court jester like Boris Johnson. It's the rapper. And I think that necessitates that we go back a little bit in history to understand the role of the rapper and the origins of the rapper. I think the best point to start at is to start where it really starts. In the middle of the In the 1500s, Europeans came up with this very, very lucrative, lucrative idea, dare I say, and fundamentally absolutely brutal idea of kidnapping, transporting around the world like cargo, and enslaving Africans on an intergenerational basis. One generation, you have children, or you are forced to breed, children, they're enslaved and on and on it went for hundreds of years. These Africans were robbed of absolutely everything you could think of. Their names, their rights, their identities, their ability to consent to anything, any form of freedom or humanity they actually had were stripped of them. They were stripped down to very bare, raw animals, often told when to breed, forced to remain absolutely illiterate, forced to extract it for everything or so, unpaid wages for hundreds of years, unpaid compensation for the actual brutality that you faced for a hundred years. And when I say unpaid, I remain unpaid till this very day. In fact, they've not received as much as an apology. In this great race were the great European powers of the time. The Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, the Danes, the Dutch, and of course, that dear best friend of liberty and freedom, the British, who stepped inside to industrialize the process and made it bigger than anything's ever been. The process came to be known as the transatlantic slave trade. Africans were stolen from Africa, shipped to the Americas, and the profits were shipped back to Britain. And then they went back down to Africa again, and that's how it went, just literally a triumph. In the process of these Africans, the exploitation they actually faced, and when they were stripped down to their raw elements, the one thing that couldn't be taken, one of the few things that couldn't be taken from them was their essence, was their creativity, was their souls. And those souls, that essence, that creativity became the basis of practically every element of modern popular culture, modern pop musical culture, pop music, from country to R&B to blues, to rock and roll, to rap, to grime, to jongles, you name or so. it emerged from that group, predominantly of that group, of enslaved Africans. They've gone on to become some of the most influential people of our time. From a British perspective, Stormsy is the flag bearer of that African who was enslaved. Even though himself he came from a Ghanaian background, he's a flag bearer of that. He carries the weight of that, and he carries it in such a unique way. So from a historical perspective, just looking at things from pure, raw history. When you look at Stormsy, you're looking at a man who's carrying the legacy of the enslaved African, of the colonized African, of the debased and devalued African who lost absolutely everything. And the voices that came out of it, the ingenuity, the talent, the creativity or so he carries that responsibility like he knows what he's doing. And the money he makes out of it, he gives back. I am in no mood to say anything that's going to tarnish our Prime Minister's amazingly polishing, shining, reputation. I'm not in any mood to do so whatsoever. But I just want to make one final few. I've got a lot more to say, but I want to make one thing clear. From the trade I just spoke of, the blood, the sweat and the tears of the African became the power, the privilege, and the profit of the European. Till this very day, if you are a descendant of the enslaved, you are more likely to end up in prison and in the penthouse. And if you're a descendant of the enslaver, you're much more likely to end up in the opposite, in the penthouse and the prison. I cannot believe 10 minutes has gone by, I've landed by first real point yet, so we're going to be here for a bit of time. We spoke of power this. thing. And I think we've really, really touched on power. We've spoken relevance, I beg a pardon. But I think the real key thing when we're defining relevance in this debate here is, as the gentleman pointed out, it's much more about power. And I think the crux of this debate is a debate about hard power versus soft power. The power of the state versus the power of the artist. And the power of the state, practically, the state has a monopoly on violence. the state has created necessity for itself on a perpetual basis. The state is inherently necessary in our current society. We cannot live. We've been convinced we cannot live without the states. You're going to bring that a lot more. That we can't live without a state. However, the artist, we all know that we can potentially live without them. So to get to the top of where, say, a stormsy is, as an artist, is absolutely essential because it's a degree of power within him, a soft power within him, that he conveys out to the entire world. It's that soft power, again, if you go back to the Africans, the early Africans, well, not the early Africans, but the Africans who are enslaved, is that soft power that help them win their freedom, that help them to survive, thrive, and become, and get to where they are at this very day. But if we bore down to a soft power versus the hard power element of it, the soft power, the hard power does everything everybody says, it sets into it, well, it outsources interest rates to the Bank of England, It determines military strategy, it detates the curriculum in education, it does everything, it controls the country. But the soft power defines the time. If I was to ask everybody in this room who was prime minister, who was king or queen during the era of Shakespeare, most people wouldn't know, even though it's a very bright room. I know you know, I knew there's going to be one smart ass who would know. But if I was to ask who was the actual prime minister in the age of Dickens or Orwell, or even in the age of Mark Morrison, who wrote the single greatest song in British history, Return of the Mac, most people probably would know it, with the exception of the latter, who is John Major, I believe, wasn't I, am I correct there, yes? But I think the key thing that we're seeing over here, essentially, and it's a really, really important room. A really, really important thing, in 200 years from now, there will be a room, this very room, I suspect, will be full of young people once again. and they could have the exact same debate. Who did more for Britain? Stormsey or Boris Johnson? Most of them probably will not be able to mention who Boris Johnson is. Storms he will not only be relevant. He will be shaping that British future that we all aspire to tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, I have run out of time, but I've not run out of waffle. Boris Johnson, I just want to say, in terms of being a role model on to say, society. Stormsy is not just a role model in society. He's a role model onto Boris Johnson. He's everything Boris Johnson really wishes he was. He's attractive. He is rich. He's successful. He is globally respected and admired around the world. He's a man of words. And at the fundamentals of what Boris Johnson really wishes he was is. that he's an entertainer. Even though Boris Johnson is an entertainer, but it's an inadvertent one. And I think that's the key thing here. When it boils down to it, in the argument of soft power versus hard power, in the argument of Boris versus Stormsie the Great, it's merely an argument. It boils down to this fundamental thing, which is this is an argument of who shapes the time, which is, of course, to a certain degree, Boris, but you don't ever forget. Boris makes you think, Stormsy makes you feel. And the key thing that we all know is that you never, ever forget how a person made you feel. And on that note, ladies and gentlemen, and with that bribe you've all received, and I hope you've digested very, very well, I commend this argument to the House, and I can plead that you actually vote in our favour. Thank you very much. I'm
