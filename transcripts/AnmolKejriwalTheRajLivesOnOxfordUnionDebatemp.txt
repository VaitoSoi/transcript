 The motion before the House tonight is that this House believes the Rage lives on. To open the case for the proposition, it gives me great pleasure to invite to this stage, Press and Sponsorship Officer, History and Policy Students from Wadham College, I'm no creature you are. Good evening and welcome to this historic debate that commemorated 75 years of independence. I would like to thank the President for giving me the opportunity to rest the House today. This is a motion that is extremely close to my heart and extremely nuanced, as most historical topics are. for it leads us to question what ifs and wonder about alternate realities. However, today, I'm not here to paint an alternate picture or to assess the results of the Rajan India. I stand here far from the capacity of esteemed academics, or someone I've experienced as a formidable guest today. Instead, I address this house as someone who grew up against a backdrop of a deeply polarized Indian political landscape, as someone who grew up treating Arundati Roy, someone who is still navigating her way to the tapest. of Eastern and Western ideals and mindsets that are delicately strong together to create what I view as India. Before I put forth my constructs, I consider it my prerogative to spend a little time talking about what the Raj means to me. Growing up the word Raj was nothing more to me than the protagonist in every cheesy Bollywood drumcom. However, once I started going to school, the Raq signified to me this 200-year-old period where in my ancestors were stripped of their dignity, my country was plundered and looted. But that's all it was, the past. However, recently, I've come to realize that the Raj is so much more. The Raj is reflected in the consciousness that constantly gnaws at me, having dark skin coming from a country that places so much importance on Eurocentric ideals and beauty, in the constant reminder of my distinct accent. In the widely censored newsre, reports in Kashmir and the terror in the streets of Uttar Pradesh. After the revolt of 1857, the perpetrators of the Raj adopted a two-fold strategy that I'm sure most of us here are aware of, divide and rule. While the tangible rules formally ended in 1947, according to my history textbooks at least, I can safely say that a divide continues to exist, exacerbates rather, making the Raj then a living dynamic organism that continues to nibble away at my country. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the crux of my argument today. Before I proceed, it falls upon me to introduce the opposition this evening. Opening for the opposition, we have AYushi, a postgraduate and a fellow committee member. Ayushi goes to Bennett's right, for now at least. The second speaker today is Sami. First of all, I'd like to congratulate you on getting the speech in one go. Hopefully today, you're a little more convincing to the members of the House than you were to your voters last Hillary. Next we have Mr. Achilles Pila Mare, a renowned journalist who writes for newspapers such as a diplomat. So I tried to look for content to roast you on, but I couldn't really find anything, which I think is a roast in itself. But it's quite generic in this house, but you're also a generic journalist. Last, we have Mr. Tiag Rajan, the finance minister of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. So I wanted to roast you, but I'm a history and politics student hoping for a political internship this summer. These are your speakers this evening, Mr. President, and they're all incredibly welcome. Now, I'd like to structure my debate into three subpoints, the religious and social polarization in India, the cultural disparities, and the Western hegemony on the narrative today. Originally, I wanted to speak about religion and politics as two separate points, but as I sat down to write my speech, I realized, just how closely entwined the two are today, and how it is virtually impossible to speak of one without talking about the other. The roots of these can easily be found in colonial India. In 1857, after India first rose up in revolt against the British rule, the administration started a systemic campaign to prevent the unity of the two majority groups in India, the Hindus and the Muslims. The British, having suspected the Muslims of being propagated of this mutiny, started a campaign to alienate the community. However, this was reversed a few decades later with the advent of the International Congress, the foremost political party in India. Over the years, the British continue to play with Hindu and Muslim religious sentiments, which eventually culminated mass communal riots and the creation of Pakistan in 1947. However, this also led to the creation of a bleeding scar, Kashmir. I'm trying to keep my discussion of Kashmir to a minimum, as I believe it's not my place today to talk about Kashmir, for I believe that I can't do justice to the kind of life people leave there in an eight-minute speech in this chamber. Therefore, I try not to simplify Kashmir and touch on it just to pepper my arguments with inclusivity. The religiously charged political landscape that has resulted in the present Hindutva government right now is also a result of the remnants of the Raj. For the Raj saw the growth of various political parties that were communally, fueled. But what this has also led to is this tradition of violence, division and this idea of being othered by a majority community, and which has now become a legitimate form of democracy in India. While my problems with the current government run deep, and I could spend hours talking about it, due to a positive time, I have to move on. The aforementioned instances, however, underscore the religious and social tension within and across the border in India, and very much prove that the divide created by the divide created by the fact that the divide created by by the Raj still continues to exist and thrive. As cliche as it sounds, one of the most insidious challenges to colonialism is the extent to which our minds are colonized. Sir Thomas Macaulay wrote in one of its infamous, infamous in my country at least, in one of its infamous reports, the need to create a class of Indian people who were Indian in appearance, but English in all the other ways that mattered, which meant morals and ideals. Almost 200 years later, I can safely say, this class still continues to exist, and this has thus created this divide between the masses in the elite in India. While I can see that culture does not have to mean the same to everyone and that identity is extremely personal, I refer here to the weighing sense of inferiority that all of us feel at being dark-skinned or not being able to speak the world's language properly in a society that places English ideals on the pedestal, and idolizes Eurocentric ideals. very much still feeding into McColle's ideas. There is a sense of imperial nostalgia that still seems to lurk among the Indian elites, especially in the face of this autocratic government right now. Within these circles, one can often hear the whisper of how the India was better off under the British or the dynastic government straight after. This then creates an unbridgeable gap, not only between those who have accesses to power and resources, and those who don't, but also within the very idea of being Indian itself, within which there is a profound dichotomy of being an Indian of belonging to a nation, but at the same time, constantly striving to imitate the West. This brings me to my last construct for tonight. The Raj boasts of having brought political unity, railways, modern ideas, modern industries to India, new education systems to India. But I ask today, at what cost? From the perspective of the colonize, I can safely say that my ancestors were stripped of their dignity, that the path to these modernizations was ridden with violence, mass torture, murder, dehumanization. In the face of all these atrocities, the celebration of democracy and modernization seems a little redundant to me. The fact that there are still debates on reparations, repatriation, on the significance of the Commonwealth, in this very chamber as well, proves to me that the colonial mindset, that the mindset of the Raj still exists and that people are still grappling with ideas of the Raj, and trying to alter it to fit the current systems of thought. Terms such as the Global South and the Commonwealth, to my mind, are a testament, a kind of acknowledgement that the Raj in many ways and forms continues to exist and will learn specifically in terms of the division that it creates within colonial states in its acceptance. This brings me to the end of my debate tonight. Before I leave, I'd like to remind you that as you walk through the doors tonight, you're not voting on the lives of armchair elites like us, but you're voting for the lives of those who've lost love once to war, for the mother who lost his son to communal violence, for the 17 million lives displaced during partition, and for the love, loss and grief that the common individual in the subcontinent is still come into terms with. After 75 years, that is. And thus, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote in favour of the motion tonight. The Raj very much still lives on. Thank you. Thank you.
