 I now look to Joshua Platt, guest liaison officer, to open the case for the opposition. It's to go boldly, Chris, don't split your infinitives. You'll have to forgive me, ladies and gentlemen, and I've been slightly shaken by that past speech. Being from Jersey, as I am, I'm shocked to learn that the Maldives could be disappearing in whatever time scale that is, as that is mostly where my neighbours tend to holiday. Madam President, I thank you very much indeed for allowing me the privilege of opening the case for the opposition, whose case I so wholeheartedly agree with and support this evening. Arguing the opposition's case tonight, fellow members, you will hear from three esteemed guest speakers, all with incredible credentials and qualifications within the scientific realm, a rarity in a chamber so often filled with P.P.E.ists, lawyers, and history students. It is therefore a great relief to me that I will be addressing you first, so that we can get all of the bog standard economics,y, politicsy bits out of the way and get on to the good stuff. In my arguments tonight, I will be outlining the three most likely scenarios, in my opinion, the pursuit of the population of Mars will manifest themselves, and I will be making the point that geopolitically, Mars population is not only a bad idea, but a potentially destabilizing one, both short term and in the long term, to the political position here on Earth. But first, as per tradition, I shall now introduce to you the honourable members of the proposition bench. So eloquently opening the case from the proposition tonight, you've just heard from Chris Collins. Is that a Mars bar in your pocket, Chris? Or are you just pleased to see me? Chris, a good friend of mine and deputy returning officer, studies classics. So I was surprised to hear that Chris would be speaking on issues of modern technology, space travel, and computational astrophysics, as these things only very rarely crop up in essays regarding Greek theatre. I did think to myself that perhaps like Icarus, Chris might be flying a little too close to the sun, or in this case, Mars, but I'm so happy to have been proven wrong in the last 10 minutes. Having said that, standing up here addressing you as a law student, I'm acutely aware that those in glass houses should not throw stones. Next, you will hear from Dr. Greg Autry, who has held a number of distinguished positions, including at NASA, as a consultant to this great university and at his own tech startup. However, most recently and somewhat excitingly, Dr. Autry has taken up a position as a professor at the Thunderbird School. So I very much look forward to hearing his insights on 1960s British children television very soon. Take up third position. We are honored to be joined by Alfredo Menev, an award-winning architect who was designed a number of Martian city complexes, including the incredible, I don't know if you've seen it, self-sustaining newer Cliff City. Having lived in five continents somewhat nomadically, it is a pleasure to me that Mr. Minoth has finally designed somewhere in a habitat that will tolerate him for a considerable period of time, if he can get there. And rounding off the case for the opposition, you will hear from Oxford's very own student of Christchurch. I have very little to say. we've only just met. You're absolutely lovely. I don't know what to. But what I will say is that you've rather drawn the shorts draw because opposite you tonight, you're being matched by a brilliant summary speaker who benefits from a distinguished career in science journalism and a PhD in space physics. But you do go to Christchurch. So, dear members, to illustrate my first point, concerning, or my only point, really, concerning the geopolitical issues with the population of Mars, I shall present to you now the three, in my opinion, most likely predictions of how the Mars habitation project could manifest itself in the future. Scenario one. Western governments pioneer this project, the population of Mars. We begin to populate Mars with colonies dominated by Western culture, Western custom, Western law and Western rule. All the while, the lower-income nations, as they always have done, play catch-up to us. The population of Mars becomes an additional project of the wealthiest countries, performed at the expense of lower income exploited nations who lose out on potential aid as a result of the magnificent cost of the habitation of Mars and a stripped of their natural resources to an even greater extent than they already are to supply this expensive Western folly in which they will have no stake. Whilst admittedly, never in relation to space travel, we see this economic cycle of exploitation repeated time and time again. Europe expands its trade empire at the expense of Indochina. More recently, the West experiences its technological revolution, reaping raw materials from Africa and South America, leaving their economies stunted, their people trapped in primary and secondary employment sectors, and their livelihoods more vulnerable than ever, to global demand and supply-side shops. What we ought to be focusing on instead, before so ambitiously looking to the next big project for the countries which already have enough to go around, is to pay our Jews to the nations that don't have enough, in part, in fact mostly in part, as a result of our immoral and often violent ambitiousness in the past. Scenario number two. State actors realize that they cannot afford such endeavours and that, owing to the political short-termism fostered by Western democratic models currently, it would not be within their interests to pursue a Mars population project, and thus the groundwork is left to private companies, such as those owned by ultra-high net worth individuals, Musk and Bezos, and whoever may come after them in the future. The downsides of this scenario are inherently obvious. I won't go into them in great detail. The divide between the haves and the have-nots back on our inadequate little planet Earth increase, and the new civilizations built on Mars, our new home, are subject to either direct rule by or the soft power influence of over-mighty, unelected individuals and private corporations. I feel I don't need to expand upon these harms any further. My point is made. A point which, by the way, rests on the underlying assumption, in fact the entire debate rests on this assumption, that we can populate Mars, that we have the funds to populate Mars, that we have the expertise to populate Mars. I'm not going to offend any of my fellow speakers by saying that we don't, we do. I've just had dinner with them and I can assure you that we absolutely have an excess of expertise to populate Mars, but I shall give you an example of a lack of economic resources in scenario two. Mars 1, a leading company in the field of Mars population research, went under before any concrete plans could materialize, and the drive and wealth of individuals such as Musk and Bezos will only last so long. Now on to scenario number three. The population of Mars becomes the next goalposts both the West and their enemies, or in the future, if you're looking more long-term, I know it's not this house will populate Mars now. There is always a particular geopolitical sphere that dominates. Whichever sphere that is, we'll call it the West now, and their enemies engage in another space race. They compete against each other to colonise this new planet. And whilst competition in most markets ought to be encouraged, history has proven that this model does not translate to sovereign states. With the population of Mars as an end goal, from a realist perspective, a new space race will only heighten political tensions here on Earth, which is currently, arguably, experiencing a shift back to geopolitical bipolar, as it usually does. No, thank you. See me at the end. We'll get a little get-together or something. So, we end up with a situation where multiple powerful geopolitical actors are attempting to gain control of a limited amount of land without the protection, I might add, of such integral, earthly doctrines of state sovereignty or a well-established body of international law, although it is there. The dangers of this new field of conflict were evidenced just a few months ago when a Russian missile test caused the crew of the ISS to begin evacuation procedures. We've witnessed man's potential inhumanity to man here on Earth for thousands of years, usually for the purposes of territorial gain in the large scale. Imagine, if you will, the risks when there is an entirely new world to dominate. I'll now sum up. Elon Musk said of the pursuit of multi-planetary habitation, it's about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. But I don't see a better future on the proposition side. I see a future of inequality, conflict and hardship where the unsolved challenges present on Earth are projected onto our new home, all in the pursuit of the habitation of a planet ill-equipped for the human race. If you want the future to be better than the past, support the opposition bench and work towards our world, our world, the Earth, free of the problems that ravage our civilization currently, embrace the challenges that we have created for ourselves on earth and tackle them head on, instead of running possibly light years away from them. Thank you very much. I'm proud to oppose.
