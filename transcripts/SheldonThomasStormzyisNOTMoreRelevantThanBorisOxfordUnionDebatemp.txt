 Speech, force upon me to invite Sharon Thomas to close the case for the opposition. I'm slightly different to everyone else, I'm going to come from a black perspective. Because sometimes the word influence gets overstated, especially when white people get involved. And for us, the kind of argument between who's relevant and who isn't, to me, is a bypass. Because the most important thing here is influence. It's as simple as that, influence. I was a member of a gang before Montgomery was born. He talks about Mike's Field. I talked before Mike Field was even existed. See, I talked from a perspective of when Brixton was one, he's talking from a perspective when Brixton is divided. Gangs are all over the face fighting each other. We didn't have that. What was the influence that's made us become gang members? See, this is a thing. What was the influence? Discrimination, social inequality, unemployment. The biggest influence was we were not like because we were black. that's a fact we were not like because we were black 15 skinheads beat my brother up to a pole broke his nose his jawbone his ribs while five police officers stood and watched and laughed that influenced me to start a gang to protect myself from racist police officers we was the first gang to go to Helton and fight skinners We were the first gang to go to Woolwich and fire a fire bomb inside the headquarters of the National Front. We was the first gang to go down to Trafalgar Square and try to kick off the door at the South African embassy. We were influenced to start a gang by the very country. Why do I need that? Because the mic is right behind you. Just don't know if we can hear you. I'm from the world, man. this is that. So, when we started a gang, we were influenced by this society. See, they all sit down and ask about why gangs started, but they don't realize that actually the gangs were started because of the government of this country. Who was the government at that time? A young woman by the name of Maggie Fatcher. She came into power with our own agenda. and her agenda did not include black people. We talk about Stormzy and we talk about the relevance of Boris Johnson. I watched Jay-Z and Beyonce go up on stage and say they're going to back Hillary Clinton. She lost. The influence of rappers is not what you think it is. See, white people can talk about influence because they want to feel good. See, black people are on the receiving end of influence. So when we have people like Jay-Z and Beyonce trying to get out there to get more black people to vote, it didn't work. And the problem here in Britain, can Storm Z get black people to vote? Hell no. Do you know why? Because we're divided. See, the problem is, is that everyone thinks, black people are all united. Say it? Point of order or point of reference or so. I just want to point out that actually, Stormy did help persuade black people to vote in 2017, actually got one of the biggest turnouts of BME and young voters. I'm going to help you with that. This is the problem. We tend to vote for a party that does nothing for us, which is Labour. And the problem with the Labour Party is that our older parents voted for them because that's what they did. So the problem in our community is that we've got rappers who really don't know the political scene because we're voting for people that don't actually help us. The Labour Party in the Conservative are both just the same to black people because for us, vote is what matters. And what matters is whether Stormsy can influence five people or 1,000 or 10,000 is neither air nor there. Because the point is this, When Labour comes in, what do they do for us? Even if Stormsy did influence people, what do they do for us? Nothing. So the question isn't whether Stormsies influence anyone to vote, because we can argue that all day. I would say this, as a black man who's grown up long before some of these guys, who's been on the road and seen death, none of my friends are shot dead. I got shot at and the bullets just missed my face. Let me tell you what influence is. The first person I ran to when I was shot at was Bernie Grant. He didn't have social media. He didn't have all of this stuff. But he was the biggest influence in our community. And guess what? He was from Arrogate and he came to Brixton. Influence isn't just about somebody who sells 10 million copies of a record. Influence is about how do you shape the very black community you're trying to aspire to change their thinking about their voting power. See, our voting power means nothing because we get nothing in return. Jeremy Corbyn, they were singing, I was listening to them singing that song and I knew they weren't going to win anything. Because singing, Kumbaya, doesn't change nothing. And that's the problem with us. We actually believe rappers and singers and footballers are influences. Yes, they have got big followers, but apart from the fact that they do some good here and they do good, how are they going to get you to vote and is that vote going to mean something to you? Because I can assure you from a black perspective, Labor means nothing. To some black people, they do. Because they're thinking one day. See, I view Boris and the president, the present Labor MP, or the present neighbour person in charge, I've classed them as the same. One tells lies and one doesn't know what to say. That's what I look at. But you see, the argument I'm presenting here is from a black perspective. See, I hear white people all the time always looking for, oh yeah, this black artist sounds good. See, they're talking from a different perspective. Our lies are different to yours. Our lies are going to be always different to you. yours. See, I don't listen to white people too much because I know they've been saying the same thing over. Every single decade we have a different black artist come through and they always try to big them up. Oh, look at this guy and look at this guy. But for the black person, for us, for us, that's a problem. Why? The people who own the record labels are white. The people who tell these rappers to talk about shooting each other are white. These The rappers who make these records are black, who are making records, who are actually going on record telling them about killing other people. Now, somebody in here said, oh, but that's a story. Let me tell you about what's a story. There's a difference between a story and glamorization. And what interscope and aftermath and all these record label do isn't a story is glamourization. Now, let me tell you what I know about glamourization. I got signed to the first major record in London company in this country, long before Stormy was even born. In 1985, I was signed to Ireland Records. And person standing next to me was a guy called Bono. Now, up until that point, I didn't know who Bonner was, because I thought I was more influential than Bonner. So he was standing next to me, and on my right-hand side was Misha Paris. And again, I thought Misha Paris was a nobody. So I took a picture with Bonner from you two and a picture of Misha Paris. And then one day, the Island Record boss invited me down to watch a TV program about something called some big thing that was going on Wembley to do with Ethiopia. And guess who was on the stage? A man called U2, or Bono from U2. And it made me realize my influence was in my own brain. Because that's what happens with rappers. That's what happened with footballers. They actually think they're more important than what they really are. Because the fact of the matter is, in the black community, half of the black community don't even know his stormy is. He's not even of our generation. He's of another different generation. And if you wish to speak to them about him and play his record, they'd be like, turned off. Why? Because of the language he speaks. Am I saying that he shouldn't say that? No, I'm saying that within the black community, it isn't as straightforward as people think it is. Africans don't get on with Caribbean. Caribbean don't get on with this one. we are fragmented. So when you speak about what's the influence, we need to be very careful because when it comes to influence and when it comes to vote, the black people have been taking for a ride every time. By the Labour and by the Conservative. One lies and one doesn't know what they're doing. And what we are involved in here is a big debate over who's influence, and I can assure you of this. There are no rappers, no sports guy, any more influential than anyone else. Why? Because until the day comes, when somebody a rapper can go on TV, and I'm going to use this example, Bono went up into UN about seven years ago to make a speech about climate and about starvation. Who listened to him? No one. Not one policy, not one thing happened when he had that debate, when he went up on the UN to make that speech. And this is Bono who have millions of people following him. Do not get me wrong. Am I saying Stormsies is not relevant? No, what I am saying is inferential power is not all that when it comes to dealing with politics. Vote. Because let me tell you something. We've got black people who are voting for Labour. When you ask them why they're voting for Labour, they don't know why. And the reason why they don't know why, because people like Stormzy and other rappers have never broken down why we shouldn't vote for Labour. And what we need to understand is I'm not belitting Stormsie. He's done some fantastic work. There's no point clicking me, you know. I'm from the road. There's nothing wrong with what Storms he's done. He's done some fantastic work. I will admit that. He's done brilliant stuff. But if we're going to stand there and talk about inferential power, let me just tell you now, in the black community, he will not make a single ounce of difference. Why? Because the old school young black men and black women just go and vote Labour and they don't know why they're voting Labour. And until that changes, don't get me wrong. Storms is relevant in the sense of yes, for your generation, he's relevant. But when you speak to black people, that's a divided rule right there. And I'm going to draw my line what Montgomery said about 410. I know that gang. Six, seven. I know them. Yes, they are influential in the sense of, but they're quite negative. They are quite negative. I spoke to all of them. Before three of them had to jail, I spoke to them. And influence is about changing the mindset of people and not only changing the mindset, but changing the political atmosphere of this country for the black people. And right now, if I'm to be honest with you, No one is helping the black people in that way. We're still voting labour. We still get nothing from them. We vote conservative. We get nothing from them. Our school system are still failing up to this day. And yes, it's great that is getting young people into university. Fantastic work. But it's not enough. Why? We don't have enough rappers, grime artists, trap and drill, doing the same thing that Stormsie is doing. We don't have enough. Rahim Sterling, Rashford, it's not enough. Yes, they are inferential, but not for the political landscape. We have got a long way to go. So when white people are want to talk and oh their big meeting about who is inferential, who ain't inferential, I am saying this. Is inferential to a degree? But to get black people to change their vote, no. It won't happen. because we're too fragmented. We've got different views. We don't all agree. And I'm going to end on this because I know my girl's banging. In 1981, before a lot of you was born, even your lecturers before your world was born, I burnt Brixton down. My gang was a member of a gang called Smallax, and we burnt Brickston down. Lord Scarman came to see us at a youth centre, are called shepherds. Yet that man, I was 16 when he came to see us. There's about 200 of us in the all. And he came in to ask me, what can we do to support black people in this country? He went back with recommendations. If Lord Scarman can't influence anyone to change, how on earth can stormy influence anyone? We had the Matt Ferson report that came out some years afterwards in 1993, telling, making recommendations, yet there was no influence whatsoever and nothing's changed. From a black perspective, nothing has changed for us. I came in today and I see all these white faces. I'm like, what the hell is this? White faces, as if we're in the last two centuries, back. We're in 2020 and yet there's no black faces on your walls. That's a disgrace. One. Black. Black. See, that's the problem. We're getting caught up. Yes, she's Asian. I'm saying black. Where are the black faces? And that's what I'm saying. If last year when my man got his head he got killed by that police officer. If that could not influence all the universities to look at themselves, to change the structure of themselves, you tell me what can. That should have been enough for you to change some of these pictures and put some black scholars up. But it wasn't enough. It wasn't enough. And that's why I look at this as a fad. because all white people want to do is discuss these things but no real change no real change ever comes to black people ever and I've been here living in this country longer than some of you've been alive and yet we're still here talking about influence Stormsie has influence but he cannot make black people change their vote Thank you.
