 The motion before the house this evening is this house welcomes the new era of porn. I now look to Liberty Osborne, a guest liaison officer, to open the case for the proposition. about a company called Mind Geek. Mind Geek was a group of guys that decided they wanted to control the way the world watched porn. And so, as more and more online porn sites merged, Mind Geek bought them up. U-Porn, Gay Tube, Red Tube, Pornhub, I'm sure many of you are intimately familiar with all of those sites, and all of them are owned by Mind Geek. And then they decided, they wanted to control not just how the world watched porn, but how the world made porn. And the same thing happened to porn production companies. They bought them out or forced them to fold due to constant piracy. They created an industry where no one could challenge them, where there was constant copyright violations, abuse on sets they owned as porn performers to survive had to adhere to their good books, where no one could have a look in. The porn you watched and how you watched it was controlled by one company. Forget about big farmer, big tech. It's big porn you lot should all be worried about. But then OnlyFans came along and the new era began. What is the new era of porn? It was the move from porn being produced on set with directors, editors and producers to be being created in porn performers and really anyone's bedrooms at home and uploaded by them. it was the move from big porn scenes on Porn Hub, freely viewed by anyone, to people subscribing to individuals' contents on sites such as OnlyFans or Fansley. This debate is not whether or not porn is a good or bad thing, or whether or not Only Fans is perfect. This debate is about a world in which porn does exist, and therefore the question is, in what form should that porn exist, and should we welcome the new era? I think that we should wholeheartedly welcome porn that empowers porn stars and makes better, more authentic porn that is actually like sex. Op need to defend a realistic alternative in this debate, because hey guys, people have sex. People like to watch other people having sex. And we think that the new era of porn is the best way for that to happen. But before I go any further, it falls on me to welcome the speakers for opposition. in today's debate. First of all, we have Matthew Dick, a first-year history student from Wardland. Now, you know, many of you might have been expecting for me to make some poor comment about Matthew's surname, but I'm not going to go blow the bow. I think it's interesting, though, to look at the programme and see that Matthew is studying history. So I have full faith that he took a question. a solely academic approach to researching the prime resources for this debate. Second, we have Louise Perry, a freelance journalist and a campaigner against sexual violence. Now, when looking up the material about Louise Perry to know what to say now, we found out that she often writes for the gripping and constantly exciting magazine of the new statesman. So I can only imagine that she wrote a book on porn in order to spice up her life. And then finally, we have Sharon Chow, a second-year Peepee. from UNIV, aka the best college. Now, I would worry Sharon at this point, but I can't quite see her over the dispatch box, so there's not much to work with. Madam President, Madam President, these are your guests, and they are most welcome. Now, moving on to this debate, I'm going to tell you two things. Firstly, that I think the new era of porn has empowered porn performers. It has helped them in the industry to be more protected and to earn more of the profits they deserve. And secondly, that you get better porn in the new era. Porn that is like sex and the porn is that is actively beneficial to teaching people what sex is like. Firstly, why do we think that the new era of porn has led to a better industry for porn actors? What happened before Only Fans, before Fansley? Porn performers were predominantly paid on the basis of scenes. They would go in for the day, they would act out a scene, and then they would go home. They would be paid for their day's work. The company, and usually by companies that mainly were owned by Mind Geek. They were paid for a day and sent away. Then OnlyFans and Fansly merged, which meant that porn actors could actually own the porn they produced, performer, profiteer, all became one. We think that this change has been revolutionary and extremely beneficial for the people most important in this debate. Why? Firstly, I think it has made the process of making porn physically safer for performers. Because of the location. If you're making porn in your bedroom during lockdown, we think it is much less likely that you're going to be coerced into doing things or abused than if you're making it in a set. and also because of the power dynamics shift. Quite rightly, the people making the porn and now the people actually in control of uploading it, actually in control of selling it, rather than it being a few rich guys at one or two companies. Look, it's certainly not perfect, and we need to be constantly aware of issues surrounding abuse in all industries. But we think changes in the porn industry that have made the porn performer, producer and profiteer increasingly won are changes that this chamber should welcome tonight. Because it is far easier to block a harassing subscriber on only fans when you have millions of others and when it's your content than to challenge the one producer on the set who is paying you everything and owns what you produce. Secondly, I think porn performers have gained more control and agency over the porn that they make. Why? Once again, it's in your bedroom. There's no one screaming at you as to what to do. No one telling you that your career is going to fail or you're going to get fired right to your face there. Compared to on the set, when you don't want to piss off the massive companies, when you don't want to ruin your relationship with a big name director and studio, and there's immediate pressure right there in your face. But it's not just more control about what you do in porn, but it's more control over the porn once you've made it. It doesn't get shipped off and edited a million times to look like something that's completely unrealistic, and you had no control over the final product. but it's your account, you're posting it, you have the agency. Yes, there are still managers, there are still trends, there are still advisors, but it is much, much better, and we should welcome that. Finally, porn performers earn far more money on Only fans than when they're working for big companies. Why? Because there's fewer middlemen taking a cut. You're not just getting paid for the day, you're able to earn money directly to yourself. And you're not just being paid for a scene, you own it. But also because copyright and piracy are rampant on sites like Pornhub. Why? Because the incentives of Mindgeek are to get traffic and ad revenue, to take your video, post it all over all of their sites because they don't care about piracy and they just want people watching it. Whereas the incentives are only fans are to keep people paying for exclusive content and thus to keep that content as exclusive as possible. shown in the fact that they offer a free copyright lawyer service for users. Look, once again, it's not perfect, but we think in this culture, porn performers are earning far, far more money than they ever did before. And why should you care? Because it's a market of not constant copyright, but constant creation. Why should you care about that? Because we think it is much better for money to be in the pockets of the people who are making the porn and actually performing in it than the pockets of the fat cats at Porn Hub. And I think that this house should welcome that. Next, why do I think that you get much better porn on Onlyfans? And I don't just mean that porn that turns you on a little bit more, but more authentic, realistic porn that is actually more like sex. Porn is increasingly created in a casual environment under this new era. It's done from people's bedrooms during lockdown, not literal fake sit and sets created for people to perform the scene in, but in people's rooms at home. There is far less of a process of scripting and editing, because it's not to make one big video that's going to be posted on their 30 different sites therein, but to make constant smaller content that is more intimate, more personal, less scripted, less edited, less overproduced. You get porn that is far more like people's actual experiences of sex. And we also think far more people are able, to make porn because rather than just a few big studios dominating all owned by the same company, anyone can post something on only fans. And this means celebrities in other areas, but also just any couple. So people see more real, more people they interact with on a daily basis, posting real sexual content online rather than people they just see as porn performers and nothing else. And we think it's unfortunate that people look at porn performers in that way, but we'd much rather a world in which you get more and more appreciation of actual people producing porn. So I welcome this porn so heartily because it's more like actual sex. And that massively impacts how people view sex. Because sex education sucks in most countries. And so for most people, porn is what they think sex is like. So if you get more realistic porn, then we think you're being able to have more realistic expectations, not just of yourself in sex, but also of others. And we think it is actively good for people to see this content on Onlyfans. Rather than just the big myth, the taboo, what's sex like? It's actively good for people to see real content that actually reflects what sex is like. Porn exists on both sides of this house. But the world of Onlyfans is much better than world run by Mindgeek. It actively empowers porn stars, and it actively empowers people. who watch porn. I urge you to walk through the idol tonight.
