 Afterwards, I now look to Tamby Kanchanadim, Director of Press, St. Peter's College, to close the case for the proposition. Before I begin, I wanted to take a moment to respond to a point, the right and honorable Lord Marlin about setting aside the evils of colonialism and empire, to which I would say for many of us that is simply not possible. Thank you, Madam President. It is an honor to be speaking in this August chamber here tonight, and it is especially an honor to be speaking at your inaugural debate of what is no doubt going to be a fantastic term. Before we begin to consider what the future of the Commonwealth might look like, I think it is worth considering what the status quo is, the status quo is of that institution. And members, it is true that the status quo of the Commonwealth, as it stands, is fundamentally remiss. As it stands, the institution is more often than not ineffective in its pursuit of democracy and human rights, and it disproportionately benefits British financial interests. These are not lofty or grand claims. These are simply facts. As much as the Commonwealth claims philanthropic kindness, and for all the aid promised to its constituent countries, Africa alone loses 30 billion pounds more than its total aids, loan, and remittances promised in at least part due to the low corporate tax rates and tax havens conveniently located in Commonwealth countries. Britain refuses to acknowledge claims made towards reparations in previous colonies, in part due to jurisdiction issues arising from the Commonwealth. And its privileges in the Commonwealth allow unprecedented access to resources in each of its constituent countries. You don't have to be attempting. And members, I would like to emphasize I am attempting an economics degree, but you don't need to be getting an economics degree to understand that this is a raw deal for the countries of the Commonwealth. And the countries that do disproportionately benefit from the Commonwealth, like Australia and Canada and New Zealand, who hold immense governing power in the institution and generally benefit from trade with long-standing ties with England, all have one particular thing in common. No, thank you. The Commonwealth might be a family of nations, but it is a deeply divided, rigid, and hierarchical family nonetheless. That said, as a proposition, it falls upon me to demonstrate that the Commonwealth, regardless of how it might conceivably evolve or grow from the current status quo, simply can not be allowed to have a future. And so, even if it is the case that the Commonwealth is capable of evolving into a beautiful, multilateral, inclusive utopia, the question remains whether this cooperation should exist within the framework of a British institution. And this institution is undoubtedly British. The opposition would have you believe that the Commonwealth can exist as some kind of post-colonial institution where every country has an entirely equal say. And to be clear, I am not against the concept of international cooperation. And I believe that every country in the Commonwealth, no matter how big or how small, deserves the power and ability on the global stage to advocate for their own financial betterment and to defend democracy and human rights and the values they believe in. But the thing about historical context, however, is that it can never truly be scrubbed away. As Australian writer Richard Flanagan said, what supposedly bound the Commonwealth together was a mysterious shared identity called Britishness. As long as this international cooperation occurs in a Commonwealth that is fundamentally tied to the British monarchy and leadership, the question remains whether a country currently in the sunset of its power in the free world deserves to helm this organization. It used to be that the sun never set in the British Empire, but members, I assure you, I have traveled all the way from America to Oxford, and there is no sun in sight, only grace guys. But the foundation of shared Britishness is important, as it raises the point of whether or not the Commonwealth can ever escape the colonial power dynamics of less than a generation ago. The Commonwealth has had over 70 years to evolve, and at some point, at some point, we have to ask ourselves why. Why is it fundamentally incapable of potency and fulfilling its mission? By virtue of the organization, having evolved from the structure of colonialism, it seems unable to overcome that insurmountable fact. For example, India, who by population makes up more than half the Commonwealth on its own and occupies a powerful position in our modern global economy has had spotty attendance at best at the Commonwealth head of government meetings. They took over six decades to take up the role of the Secretary General and have barely been involved in any of what the Commonwealth proclaims as its foremost achievements, like the creation of the Secretariat or the Singapore Declaration of 1971. Yes, every country chooses to enter the Commonwealth. But how can you expect them to put in the money, the time, and the resources to benefit an institution that is an unwelcome reminder of the evils that remain in living memory? In my family alone, we speak in hush tones of when my great grandfather went into hiding to avoid the brutal British persecution during the struggle for independence. And I assure you, nearly every single family with roots in a former British colony has nearly identical stories to share. Even if its member countries were to abandon the memory of colonial brutality, as long as the Commonwealth continues to exist, Britain can hide behind the supposed placid benevolence of its role in the Commonwealth. Even as its own policies and its own actions disadvantaged those same set of constituent countries elsewhere. When England denies entry and wrongfully deports Commonwealth citizens of the Windrush generation, it hides behind its role in the Commonwealth. When England abides by human rights atrocities globally and abandons its grand ambitions for global democracy, it hides behind its role in the Commonwealth. As long as the Commonwealth exists, it will continue to be an alibi for British actions on the global stage, even as the institution of the Commonwealth itself does so little to right these wrongs. Ladies and gentlemen, as you walk through those doors and you consider your vote on this debate, consider this. This debate is not necessarily about the efficacy of one single institution. It is, however, about the importance that we place on acknowledging the impact of our shared history. A shared history that holds renewed meaning as we strive to acknowledge and learn from those of diverse backgrounds and experiences both inside and. outside this chamber. Implying that the Commonwealth is a faultless institution that inspires only goodwill and benevolent action around the world is nothing short of a pipe dream and a blatant falsehood. And declaring that the Commonwealth can move on from its eerie past and current tribulations undermines the lasting dynamics and resentments that permeate our modern institutions. A vote for the proposition, however, acknowledges the fundamental power of our shared history. Members, I hope that you will join me in voting for their proposition. Thank you.
