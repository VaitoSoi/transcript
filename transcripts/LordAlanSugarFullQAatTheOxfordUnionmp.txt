 Thank you so much for time. It is. It is. It is. It's like you can't get enough of us. We're very very very very about that but it is the fifth time. So before coming in earlier on, we had a little chat and I asked a couple years ago, I applied for Young Apprentice, why didn't I get picked? I looked at your CV and you was just not good enough. No, I don't know what happened. Why didn't you get picked? I'm not sure. I mean, so many people applied for it. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people applied for it. I don't know. It didn't call you for any of the auditions. I got to the third run, the one before the final one. Oh really? Oh, really? Well, you could try again maybe as a junior. You still look quite young. True. Talking about The Apprentice, we're just highlighted how lots of people apply for it. Why do you think so many people are driving on to want to show in the business acumen, why does TV show so popular from your perspective? Well, the thing is, first of all, there's a, I think a lot of people ignore the fact that the original format was that they would get a job working for me as a six-figure sum. That frankly never worked out too well. Because if you can imagine that the who deservedly won had to come and work in one of my companies where people were earning far less than that so you can imagine they weren't very welcome when they turned up and so I changed the format to the winner's going to end up in a business with me a 50-50 business right and they get and I inject 250,000 pounds from day one and they get on running the business and I help and mentor them along on my team helps and mentors them along also so they've been it's been very successful since we started that I think that that started from around about series seven and we're now on series 17 or 18 I can't remember minus the junior apprentice that you didn't get in I don't want to rub it in, but the ones that you never got into. That's okay. I hope I get over it. We've got over it, right? So obviously you've partnered up with a lot of business people through the show. It might be difficult to choose your favourite one, but which journey with a businessman that has come out the apprentice, do you find the most inspiring or do you remember the most fondly? Sorry, I'm not understanding the question. So from the show there's been many businessmen and women who have partnered with you and we're wondering what story or which business you'd like remember the most iconically or one of which you feel like the journey was quite inspiring to you. Well I think when I changed the format from a job to a business partnership, the first winner of a business partnership was Tom Pellero who's kind of like, I suppose the only way you can describe him is a bit of a nutty. professor really and watching him actually become a businessman has been a tremendous journey because he's really a kind of an inventor so to speak and some of his inventions weren't that good I got to tell you but the he he's now turned into a businessman he understands profits and loss and things like that so he's kind of like I suppose the transition of 50-50 partnership, he was the baby of that invention, if you like. So he can't, he's done very well. It's done very, very well. Wow, that's amazing. And the audience there are probably some people who have aspirations to go into business and are thinking of what qualities make a good business partner. And obviously for different partners, different ingredients make them work together. If you were to match together the hypothetical traits of the best business partner, what would you not feel? Well, you know, that is a question which has been asked of me 20,000 times. And I can tell you one thing, you cannot go into boots and buy a bottle of entrepreneur juice. Right. Neither can you go into W.H. Smith and buy a book that tells you how I'm going to be an entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is inbuilt in their DNA, if you like. Now, the next analogy I will give you is if you locked me in a room for two years with a piano teacher, I guess after a couple of years I might be able to render a version of roll out the barrel. Would I ever be a concert pianist never in a million years? and it goes the same for certain people. There are people in this audience today that are going to be doctors, scientists, accountants and lawyers, God forbid. And they just don't have the acumen for business. So you have to have it, and it has to be in you, and you can bring it out of people. That's amazing. One last question connected to The Apprentice. When you started the show, you had a vision in mind of where you wanted it to go. What future do you think there is for the apprentices and I do you think you're meeting the vision you set out in the beginning? Well, I had no vision for it. I mean, the original apprentice was formed in America where Donald Trump was the equivalent of what I do, I was the equivalent of what he did. He was useless, to be honest with you. Completely useless. And BBC bought the format, and they wanted to find a businessman to replicate what occurred in America. And they came along and asked me, and I thought it was rather exciting. And I took it on in 2003 or 2004. I can't remember exactly when it was. exactly when it was with no vision that it would go on for 18 years but it has just gone on on on on you know and I'll carry on doing it you know until you know I feel that I've had enough that's amazing and in terms of you as a profile you're someone who as you highlighted has gone involving many things from running your own company to work in and and in and in in media and also being a member of the heart of lords you're worth over a billion pounds at this present time that's arguable yeah at this present time it's kind of obvious that you probably don't need to work for money what motivates you to have the energy to get involved in all the things that you well who told you it's not the motivation to work for money because that is it you know that is it is always making a profit is is built in me yeah and that will never go away a deal I'm always I'm a deal maker you know we're going to open it up to the floor yet absolutely I'm not going to hog all the questions you say we spoke about this before you said 15 minutes of Q&A then go into the questions before I open up to the floor you just want to remind the audience members that law sugar would like you to get straight to the point make your questions as brief as possible and yeah I'd like to look to the floor for the first speaker superb I recognize maybe you're closer the person with the pink shirt Thank you, Lord Siger, for coming to the Union for the fifth time. My question generally deals with the inequality between the society we live in. Over the COVID year, you saw that the wealthy people accumulated massive amount of wealth with a lot of power in there. Do you think what responsibility do billionaires like you have to the society you live, you live in in terms of contributing bank. I'm not following you a question. Who amassed a lot of wealth? Sorry. This is a general question about the obligation. What's it got to do with COVID? Sorry, are you suggesting that when COVID came, some people capitalized on it in favor of ordinary people? Or what? No, I'm not suggesting that they capitalized on it. Clarify your question. So the question in their regard is basically that in COVID-19, a lot of big corporations because as a result of COVID-19 did make a lot of money. Data suggests that in the last 24 months alone of COVID-19 some billion years made more money that they would not have made in 23 years alone in the period. Well I don't know where you get your statistics from. I'm sorry because I didn't make any more money during COVID-19 I can assure you. I mean maybe some drug companies or someone like that made some extra money but I don't know I can't imagine who else I mean most of the high street was shut down businesses were shut down you know and it's had a terrible effect on business in general so I'm not quite sure where you're getting your information from but those anyway how about someone else now thank you very much I look for another speaker I can have audience member with a black shirt down there It's there. Could you get up? Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Alan, as well. It's been very good, so I hope this question is clear. So I just want to ask, now I just want to ask a question about entrepreneurship. So there's quite a few, I would say, obstacles to becoming an entrepreneur in Britain today. There's quite a lot of regulation. There's quite high corporate taxes. So, Alan, if you were to look at search. to look at certain regulatory or tax impediments to become a businessman or a businesswoman, which ones would you think about removing? How do you think we should make it easier for people to become entrepreneurs? Can I just answer that simply? Yeah, go on. If you're a businessman, don't worry about tax. Start worrying about making some money, first of all, right? And then that's a, you know, a high-class problem paying your tax afterwards, yeah? Yeah. Is there anything else? No, not really. I mean, yeah. Fair answer, fair answer. Okay, yeah. Thank you. I look for another member for a question. Gentleman over there has been very patient with his hand up. Thank you and thank you for coming. I have two questions, both very short. Firstly, who's your favourite dragon on dragons den? Dan. And I think you've been on Dragon's Den so the answer can be you. I've never been on Dragons Den, no. No? God, I'm a fool. The second question. I like Peter Jones, really. He's kind of stuck it out, hasn't he, from the very beginning? And then there's been quite a few people that have changed. He's quite a shrewd guy and I've got a lot of respect for him. Yeah. Thank you. Second question, reiterating the sentiment of Isra, the first speaker. I think it's fair to say that we're currently going through financially turbulent times, regardless of COVID or anything else, cost of living crisis, rise of inflation. Do you think there should be a greater financial burden taken by businesses, by people who are wealthy, to perhaps alleviate the pretty bad times that a lot of... people in this country going through. Well, you can't put it down to individuals. I think when you say people that are wealthy, no, I mean corporations like, for example, British petroleum at the moment, for some reason rather start the price of petrol up to some astronomical level and are rolling in loads and loads of profits and all that. There the government should step in and say, you know, this is kind of like restrictive practices, if you like. There's no reason for you to whack the price up as it is and the government needs to come in and to control people exploiting things, right? But you can't hold back businesses and entrepreneurs. You can't hold them back because they are the backbone of the economy of this country. They are the people that pay their taxes and support the National Health Service, the schools and indeed maybe this university, I don't know. So do you think then in specific circumstances like a windfall tax on profits from oil and gas, you would be in favour of that? I think specific industries, for example, should be audited by the government and one of them should be British Petroleum and Shell and people like that, where the government can have mandatory audit as to them exploiting things. it's no good sticking up the duty on petrol because all that does is punish you. It doesn't punish them. And even if you do increase the duty on petrol, the likes of you are not going to see the benefit of it because it will get eaten up, paying off debt somewhere else that the government has incurred. So you need to nip it in the bud at the companies that are taking disadvantage of us at the moment yeah thank you thank you another question I recognize the member at the press bench right here hi Lachia thank you so much as we mentioned earlier there was the junior apprentice for a few seasons and there's been a lot of age range between the apprentice candidates and but most of the winners have been you know slightly older although you yourself started your business quite young and I was just wondering how you thought that young people could be taken more seriously in their entrepreneurial ventures and what it would take for one of them to win. We've had young people in the starting the starting line of the apprentice. There's no kind of age restriction, if you like. And to be perfectly frank with you, I can't recall the youngest one that has won. They were both 18 or 19. Two seasons ago they were 18 or 19 when they start? No, I'm talking about the winners, you're talking about. Oh, okay. I can't recall, but we did have some 18-year-olds, yeah. There's no holding them back, really. I was 17 and 16, I think 16 or 17 when I started my business. If the apprentice was around then, I would have won it. There's no question of it. What mistakes do you think they made that you didn't? I don't think they've made any mistakes. They're young people and, you know, I can't tell you specifically and I can't remember exactly the individuals, but it wasn't to do with their age. It was to do with their lack of business acumen or, dare I say, common sense. Thank you. I recognize the speaker just with a card up there. Give me a yellow card. Thanks a lot for coming and thanks for answering the questions so eloquently. What, if anything, makes you laugh? Well, that clearly did. Some of my apprentices, actually. Boris Johnson is one, yeah. He's an unintentional clown, but he makes me laugh. No, I don't know what makes me laugh. Ask my wife, I should tell you. We watch a lot of garbage television occasionally, So it's just to relax. That's the way I relax watching junk TV. And that can make you laugh a bit. I've been watching recently the court case of Johnny Depp and his wife. That's hysterical really. We saw, I mean, that is entertainment. I mean, and we saw yesterday a psychiatrist who was very funny on there. I mean, it was a nutter, a complete nutter. If anybody needed a sidecrashes, it's him. Yeah. So that's kind of stuff that makes me laugh, I suppose. Thank you. This young lady here has been patient. She wants to ask a question. I just wanted to get everyone down and then get here, because, well, yeah, we can go for her, definitely. We're going to have people sprint up and down. Definitely, go for it. Less fun question, I'm afraid. But with so much experience, What do you think businesses could do to reduce gender inequality in business, whether that's like pay or promotion? We don't have gender, I've never had gender inequality in any of my businesses, really. I agree with you, if that's what you're alluding to, that male, female, or whatever they want to call themselves, are entitled to be paid the same amount of money as everyone else. I mean it's been old-fashioned that the women would take a back seat and shouldn't be paid as much as males. But those times have gone now. They really have gone. Again, it is industry-specific, for example. I mean, in my day in Amstrad, it was very rare for us to have a female hardware engineer. I don't know why, but it just was not thought of. that you'd be a hardware engineer, you know. But of course nowadays we have more female software code writers than the mouse, or about an equal balance really. And they get paid, thanks to people like Google, they get paid for an absolute bloody fortune, for lounging around on beanbags and all that stuff. So, yeah, I'm with you on that. And as you can see, the line of you. you can say the last winners of the apprentice of all been women women women thank you the speaker here hello Lord Sugar after the first few questions I'm kind of scared to ask a question now I was just wondering what your opinions were in general like hustle culture or at least like really extreme hustle culture so like in like YouTube and stuff if you search anything about like entrepreneurship you'll hear things like oh you need to have like an 20-hour work day or like a 19-hour hour work day like kind of what are your thoughts of these like extreme like hustle culture gurus you know what culture hustle culture what is that yeah so it's kind of it's kind of like the idea that like in order to succeed you need to work like 19 hours you have to like cut out your friends and like your family and like you have to work purely on like you know you have to think about success you've got to work hard right nothing comes about working hard and so I I'm I'm switched on 24-7, right, all the time. And that's because maybe I'm a bit unique. I know that my two sons are basically the same. And, you know, some of my grandkids are exactly the same. It's a culture, right? But I'm glad you asked that question, because I tell you what is annoying me tremendously now, getting back to our friend there with his COVID thing, the people that have benefited most in COVID have become a bunch of lazy, layabouts, right, the ones that want to come and ask for a job in one of my companies and the first question they ask is can I work from home and that sickenes me quite frankly and I would like to say to you as a young audience here thinking about coming out you can sit down now if you want to thinking thinking of coming out of university into a job you may have some of your mates that are telling you it's quite good I work for so and so, so, so. Actually, I lay in bed with my Apple thing and that's how I get paid. It's sickening and I've got to tell you, you will learn nothing. You will learn nothing working that way. And I say to those people, what did your mum and dad do? Did they work from home? No. The biggest problem I have is with the government itself, the civil servants who have exploited what has been brought about by COVID of this kind of working from home which was necessary in the very early days, no question of it, that was absolutely necessary to isolate and keep away from each other, but we're well past that now. But yet they're still working from home because they've got used to it. So you can't get a passport now, not unless you're prepared to wait for, God knows how long. You can't get a new driving licence because you can't, whatever. The only thing that makes me laugh, and that gentleman asks me what makes you laugh, is that HMRC, the people that collect your taxes, even they are slow, which is not too bad. But it's sickening. I can't stand this worker from home culture. And I was told the other day, you know, grow up, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're living in the old days, you know, you know, you're out of touch. I'm not out of touch, believe me. To answer your question, if you, wherever you're going to go to work, if you think you're qualified when you leave here, I'm sorry to say you are not. You're qualified maybe academically with the subject that you have learned, but as far as the world is concerned, as far as business is concerned, and I'm not saying in a decade and nasty way, you know nothing, I'm telling you, right? You do, know nothing, right? Until you get in that workplace and then you're bouncing off of each other, you're bouncing off of people who are older than you, and you're asking questions and that banter that goes on in offices and workplaces is where you learn. And it doesn't matter what, you know, what walk and life you're in. Thank you. Should we get someone from down there, a person on the blue top? Just right here on the second row. Hi Lord Sugar, nice to meet you. To my understanding, you achieved success through Amstrad and setting personal computers and then you decided to diversify into other electronics such as games consoles and creating skyboxes and then you decided to leave the industry altogether. all together. My question is do you regret diversifying and focusing on real estate? No, it's a good question. Basically, I love electronics and I've been in the electronics business since I was 18 years old from when I first started and we've seen that I mean look at this what I've seen in my lifetime and you might not you might find it difficult to understand. We've seen some something called mobile phones, for example, which for you is like, well, what's the big deal? But it was a big deal to actually have a phone that works in the street. We've seen something called the internet. We've seen the speed of the internet now, how we can shove things through so quickly with video and all that stuff. The actual lifetime that I've lived through electronics, I don't know whether we're ever going to, whether we can ever experience again that rapid increase in technology. And I hope that the health industry or medical industry, and I'm not familiar with that too much, but I hope they can progress in the same way as the electronics industry as progress, because it's fascinating, it's been fascinating. Why did I let go of the computer company? Well, it let go of me, to be honest with you. I made a fatal error when was on the way up. We made a bad batch of stuff, a new design, a new range of computers that didn't work too well, and consequently we lost the market. It's as simple as that. And it just goes to show you that investment in engineers and in some cleverer people and not being so focused on the bottom line profit all the time and just invest more in staff and people and technologists that maybe could have avoided that. And I look back in hindsight, you know, I kicked myself from that. Skyboxes, well that's another story. him. Murdoch, when he phoned me up one day and said to me, I'm going to send a satellite up. Can you make these boxes? I said, yes, we'll have a go. Didn't have a clue what we were doing. Honestly, I swear to you, we didn't have a clue how to make a skybox in those days. But I just said yes. and he said, well, if you make the boxes, I'll put the satellite up, and that's what happened. And two days ago, I set the task in St Paul's Cathedral for the apprentice, and on the inside, there was a memorial, allegedly, it's where Christopher Wren is buried. And I remember saying to Karen, Christopher Wren will be remembered for this building. Alan Sugar will be remembered for their ugly dishes on all the houses because they are just millions of them out there now. Thank you. I recognise the speaker at the far end, the lady. Hi, Ed. I was wondering, what's the best piece of feedback that you've ever. Hi, I was wondering, what's the best piece of feedback that you've ever received? In what respect, sorry? Maybe in terms of personal development or business, something that you thought that's good advice and I'll remember this. Hmm. Yeah, it's a good question. I don't know is the answer. I don't have an answer for you on that one at the moment. Well, get another question, but I'll be thinking about it because it's a very good question actually. The best bit of feedback, best bit of advice you were saying, yeah. Yeah, so let me think about it. I'll make something up as we go along. Looking for someone on this side, probably the guy with the blue and then we go to you. Could you leave your hand up so the light blue? Hello, a slightly related point. I was wondering who you'd consider to be your mentors and how they've kind of helped you over the course of your career. Well, I didn't have many mentors. There was I came from, I was born in Hackney in London and brought up in council flats. My father was a tailor that worked in a factory. And I guess that one looked up to, I guess, the businessman in the family, which at the time was my uncle that had a shop in Victoria. So I looked at him. And as time went by, there was, as I went into business on my own, you would look at other people and you would admire what they've done and achieved. And step by step, I kind of overtook them, if you understand what I mean. So there's been lots of different ones along the way. I could throw some names at you, you wouldn't know who they are. You know, there were people that were in the electronics business that you thought, oh, they are the, they're the bees' knees, you know. I wish I was like him. And then three, four years later, he was wishing he was like me, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Yes, the member of the edge of this third role right here, just at the edge on the side, sorry. Across your career in business, do you have any regrets and are there any moments when you wish you'd have played your hand differently or done something a bit differently? Yeah, I think I alluded to just now the disaster of what we call the 2000 series computers. And, you know, it's all great in hindsight, really. I know exactly the mistake that I made and it was lack of investment in. in engineers and costs and infrastructure. So there's lots of mistakes, but you know what? I've made loads of, and of course I've made loads of mistakes. Everybody makes mistakes in business. In the real estate market, we've made mistakes. In The Apprentice, for example, there's been a couple of candidates that won that didn't last very long. So there's a mistake in choosing the wrong person. Yeah, you make mistakes, but you just hope to make more correct moves than wrong ones, you know? And I guess that's what I've done. I made a few more correct moves than wrong ones. Thank you. Right, I recognize the speaker just on the second row here with the blue and black top. Good evening, Lord Sugar. Thanks for coming. My question is more of a fun question. I'd say, what was your most interesting or memorable product or business venture that you took part in? Or that you spearheaded. Yeah. Well. And it could be the Pudsy as well. A big a pardon? Ams Bear. My apologies. Ams bear. That's my favourite anyway. Ams what? Ams bear. The Puddy spin off? It's all right. Don't worry about it. Anyway, yeah. What's been your favourite business? this venture? Well, Amstrad obviously, but I think what you're asking is what my pet product was that really made me take off and that was the audio units, you know, the high-fire stereo units. Now, you lot here wouldn't know what they were because you wouldn't go near one, you wouldn't touch one with a barge pole now because you've got your iPhones that you plug into something or other or whatever. But there was a time when people had amplifiers and tuners and cassette players and the big giant companies like Sony and Toshiba and Hitashi and all that used to make these very beautiful looking pieces of equipment in metal and aluminium and they would put them in a wooden rack with a record player on the top and they would sell for hundreds and hundreds of pounds and one day I decided what I'm going to do I realized that these these guys the consumers were buying a separate amplifier a separate tuner a separate cassette deck and putting them in a wooden rack each of them had a separate cable you plugged into the power you had to interconnect them all to make them work and it suddenly dawned upon me what a way the time these things sit in a rack why do you need three electric cables why do you need three power supplies why do you need intercontinental what you do is fake a front panel like that to make it look like you've got three separate units and stick the electronics behind with one cable and wire it all up internally so that i i reckon was one of my greatest ideas is to come up with this tower unit which and I'm trying to fill things in context for you now the the the pioneers and the the sonies and all that at that time to have a rack like that would have cost you six or seven hundred pounds I brought this thing out for 199 pounds with a record player on the top a glass door opening up it really look at what we used to call a Mug-Zifel and it took off like a rocket and actually gave me the biggest entry into the traditional retail markets into the retailers which were hard to get into. And that's where I really started to make big loads and loads of money with that tower unit. So that's, I would guess that would go down as one of my, and then of course you got the first computer that we made. What's my favourite? I don't know. People were telling me to make computers and I had a different approach to it. Being a consumer electronics man, we would build stuff and basically focus on what we call the bill of material right down to the resistors and the capacitors and all that stuff and we would negotiate very hard to get the bill of of material down so that we could sell the product rather cheaply. The computer industry was one which was kind of had this kind of fascination about it, where, oh, it's a computer and it must be expensive. But actually when you unscrewed the box and opened it up, inside was a printed circuit board with a load of resistors, capacitors and chips. And that was my view. Well, this don't look like a thousand quids worth of stuff. here this is more like 50 quids worth of stuff inside you if you understand what I mean so we brought out a word processor once for 399 pounds when the nearest word processor that was on the market was 2,000 pounds and i never forget the cues in tottenham court road outside dixon's and all that stuff to buy this thing they couldn't believe they couldn't believe it we sold millions of the bloody things yeah and yeah so that was it it's taken a different approach to it and it kind of turned the computer industry we were the largest computer supplier in europe we had 33% of the european market within two or three years so they yeah the the tower unit was the was the thing i I remember the most and followed on by a computer. I'm still thinking about your question, young lady up the back down. Thank you. Can we have the speaker just behind with the cream jumper? Hello, do you think you deserve your lordship? Yes. Why did you ask? I don't really know what you got it for, so... Right. Well, we'll sit down then. Next. Thanks. I reckon I had to speak just on that second row with the brown top. Is this spoken before? What drives you now, and how's it changed? Pardon? What drives you now? I just, I like to do a deal, you know, anything to do with a deal, closing the deal, keeping me occupied as far as that concern, a bit of aggravation, and doing a deal. That's what I am. Yeah, that's it. Thank you. The gentleman at the far edge of that seat. Good evening. Thank you for attending. I began my career as an apprentice engineer. What key lessons must engineers be to be successful entrepreneurs? Well, an engineer's mentality is different to a commercial person. As you know, they're very focused on their speciality. And I suppose that if you look at the likes of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, they were engineers initially of some kind and then recognize that there's money to be made here. Yeah? And I suppose it's that entrepreneurial spark again. It's suddenly something clicks that you've been sitting there, you've been told that this chip that Texas Instruments makes costs 500 pound and you know that all it is a little bit of plastic with a bit of silicon inside and that can't be right. So you might decide that you want to make one yourself or go off and start making chips yourself. It's and you'd be in a better position than anyone else to realise that because you can see that these expensive components that you may have been involved in really are not worth what we're paying for them. Yeah. Thank you. I recognize the speaker at the front press bench there with a blue top. Do you ever still go back to Hackney if you do like, does it feel like home? I beg a pardon? Do you ever go back to Hackney? No, I don't. To be honest with you, no. And it's a good question, I should do. I was dreaming the other day about Springfield Park, which is in Hackney, where I used to live, and play football and all that stuff. It's a good idea. I will do. I find the time to go and walk through those streets again, yeah. One thing I will tell you is that being on the apprentice, and this, you may recognize this phenomenon also. As a child, you might have seen the playground at school or the road that you lived in and you think, oh, it's very, very big, massive. And in the flats that I lived in, to us, the four-quartered, of the flats seemed massive to me. I went back there to do some filming in The Apprentice and of course it's so small. You don't realize how small it was, but in a young person's mind, it was larger. So, yeah, I will go back and have a look down there. I walk the streets there, see if I were... Yeah, Hackney Empire, of course, is the theatre that I rebuilt. which is now a buzzing area around that area. And in the real estate market, for example, there was streets in Hackney that 25 years ago, you could have bought a massive big Georgian house for a thousand pounds, two thousand pounds, they're now selling for a million pounds because it's become very fashionable. Thank you. Just the speaker with a black top right behind you there. Could you keep your hands up? No, no, just behind you on the third row. Going back to something you said earlier, do you think that a desire to work from home, like post-COVID, comes from laziness? Or do you think there's other concerns like childcare and the environmental impacts of commuting and being in an office? Okay, so let me qualify this, shall I? Let me qualify this. There's always been a good reason for people to work from home, childcare or people who are not very well disabled or whatever, and they work from home diligently, okay? COVID has brought about an environment where people were sent to work at home, quite rightly so at the time. The internet, as we talked about just now, has made it possible for them to do the work that they would normally do sitting at a desk and the penny finally dropped with them that I like this actually. Boris says get back to work. No, not really. I don't think so. I don't want to get back to work. I'm liking being at home here. And those are the ones that are annoying me, right? They really are annoying me. I'm not talking about those people that genuinely have to work from home and all that stuff. Obviously, that's been going on. for years, people that did work from home. I've had people work for me that had to work from home prior to COVID. There's no problem at all, as far as I'm concerned, because it was a genuine reason for them to work from home. But there's no genuine reason for most of the people now, other than complete laziness and complete exploitation of employees. And some of them are idiots. I mean, some of the giant city firms are encouraging it, you know. Who was it? PWC, I think the other day. I wrote an article for the Daily Mail that got a lot of response. And they said, oh, if you're good boys, you can all take Friday off now. I mean, where are they coming from, these guys? I don't get it. why? And I go back to your mum and dads, you know, go and go home and ask them whether they're bosses. You can work from home, no problem. How many days a week do you want to come into the office? One, two, up to you. You know, no, I don't like it. Call me old-fashioned. Call me behind the times. You can call me what you want. But I will never condone that unless it's for a genuine reason that you've outlined. Can I follow up? If you can genuinely do your job to the same quality Yeah, that is debatable, you see, because, you know, I... Who says it's the same quality? You, right? It's your employer that is the one that decides whether it's the same quality or not, no? You say it's the same quality, right? And that's the problem. The problem is, is that how many times when you worked in an office that this girl comes over to you and says, oh, by the way, where's the invoice for Fred? Oh, it's over there. Oh, and have you sent an email to John? Have you sent the order through to Bill? Have you done this? All of those casual conversations are what works all about, okay? And when you're sitting at home, that doesn't happen. So the invoice to John did. didn't go, the order to Fred didn't go, and the order to Bill didn't go. Yeah, they all fall on their flat in their face and it slows everything down because suddenly the invoice to John, someone said, I haven't had my invoice yet, and that's because oh, I forgot to do it, or I didn't do it, or this person didn't tell me to do it. I'm sick of it, to be quite frank, I'm sick of, I'm sick of, I'm sick of what's going on at the moment. And I just hope that you young people don't fall for it. But I've told you already, you won't learn anything in these jobs that you go to unless you get stuck in with the rest of your colleagues. Thank you. I look for another member, I recognize the member on the side of the house just with the glasses. Good evening. Good evening. Have you ever been screwed over in a business sense and did you manage to get any revenge? No. Screwed over, yes, all the time. I mean, of course you do. Yeah. I mean, you know, especially when you're younger, you get screwed over if you call it. And it's part of learning, you know. Can't get screwed over working from home, mind you. You know? But it's part of learning. It makes you tougher and understand, you know, if you get to you get taken for a ride by somebody and it won't happen the second time if you know what I mean all part of learning yeah that lady down the back there who gave me that question yes is that you yeah old question the the old question there's one next to her no no she she asked me a question about a serious bit of a serious bit of advice was given to me is that right where are you stand up I can't see yes Well, I'll tell you what it was. I'll tell you what it was now. I've had time to think about it. Going back when I was 11 or 12 or whatever, the primary school that I was at used to put on an end of term display of all the children's work, and the parents would come around, and they needed somebody to guide the parents round. So this is class four and this is class five and this is that and this is the work from so and so, blah blah, blah. And the headmaster of that school, Mr. Kirschel, I'll never forget, said, Sugar, you get out there and you're going to do this, right? And then they had the mayor of Hackney was standing around and the people, I could see these adults smiling, at me but there's a kind of smile of admiration I think it was now because I was talking my heart out about this thing right and then I finally went to the secondary school where I chose the science curriculum rather than economics and that my headmaster there Mr Harris said to me he used to see me walking down the corridors and he said, oh, sugar, your economics. He said, no, no, so I'm science and engineering. No, he said, no, no, no, no, no, no, your economics like that. And that's what, you know, I never forget that. He saw something in me, which he was quite right about. I was right also because most of my products were scientific anyway, but he saw the commercial side. So, yeah, it was Mr. Harris and Mr. Kershaw. to answer your question yeah thank you we've got chance for just a couple more questions i'll take one more from that side i see the member with the blue top with the hands raised up could you have your hand up so that the mic come to me hi um nice to meet you i'm myakin and you mentioned in the past that while your children were growing up you used to take the weekend off i was just wondering if now as the adults and you have grandchildren. Do you still have time that you've blocked out to just relax and have leisure? I've actually been a five day a week bloke, really, to be honest with you. Really intense work, Monday to Friday. And I've never really worked on the weekends. Unless, of course, it was something special like an exhibition or I was abroad doing something like that. But Monday to Friday was my work, you know, it's when I used to work hard, very hard. In fact, my wife reminds me that in the early days, I would leave home at six o'clock in the morning and get back at seven o'clock at night, by which time I hadn't seen the children at all because they hadn't woken up yet and they were in bed by the time I got back. Yeah, some people might say that was a blessing, but no. But, yeah, five days a week, and that's how it is. Still now, really. Do you see yourself slowing down from the five-day week or just... Sorry? Do you see yourself ever reducing the five-day week? No, not really. But, I mean, look, when I talk about, I mean, I'm going to be a little bit contradictory here now because I can do a lot of that work from home. But, or from wherever I am in the world. I've got, you know, I've got places in America and in Europe and I'm on the ball from there, working from there. But, no, it is kind of like a kind of a guilt, if you like, and you might not understand this, but five o'clock, if I go home early, I feel a bit guilty. that I shouldn't be home, I should be working. So I will go into my study and sit down and twiddle my thumbs until it is six o'clock and then think, oh okay, fair enough, it works over, yeah. Okay, thank you. Cool, a couple more questions. One from this side, I recognise the member with the spotty top there. Spotty top, the one's in the middle here. Thank you for coming today. On The Apprentice, you occasionally do tasks working with the art market. So I was wondering what you think the position of the art market is in the business world and do you have any advice for an artist trying to enter, make a business? Well, it's a very good question. In Mayfair, in Mayfair in London, what fascinates me, and we're in the real estate business, okay? Some of the art galleries there occupy premises which must cost them an absolute fortune, an absolute fortune. And I often wonder, I say to my wife sometimes, we walk past these places and you see three or four paintings then. How the bloody hell do they make any money? How do they pay their rent? rent and I'll tell you how it's because it's in the eye of the beholder someone slapped a bit of paint on a canvas somewhere and told a story about how this person was so inspirational it's wonderful you look at the picture and you can visualize you're there and by the way it's 700 grand but actually it actually cost seven pounds to produce so yes there's a market in art but I think what it needs to be associated with gaining a reputation for in other words a famous artist will will get we'll get the work you know if you understand what I mean and how do you become a famous artist I don't know banks is done well isn't they really yeah yeah but yes we did have some art things but and I remember going to a couple of these things and looking at some of this stuff and in fact we set a task once in right in the centre of Mayfair it was in Christie's the auction house and while I've ever muck while the camera crews and all those people were mustering around getting themselves ready I was having a little walk around and I saw a blank canvas on the wall white canvas just to blank white canvas on the wall, a chair, a small wooden chair, and a cello next to it. I thought, what's that doing there? And then there was a label up there. 750,000 pounds for these three pieces of tuit. Unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was saying. And then I said to the curator, whoever he was walking around, was telling me not to touch anything, God forbid. God forbid. And I said, what is this? What is this thing? I'm sorry, this is Fred Bloggs, whatever his name was. Oh, this is a famous artist. I see, it's a bloody chair. A bloody chair and a cello and a piece of white canvas. What's the big deal? Well, I'm wasted my time talking to you, so to speak. So that's it. That's what art's all about. Did you realize I went once to the Louvre in we went to Paris once to the Louvre and I was with some friends who believe they're very cultural and understand art and all that stuff. I just went there because it was raining outside and we saw some pictures of Monet okay and the way you view a Monet painting is the half close your eyes because it transpires that he was blind or he had cataracts and if you look at a lot of his paintings they're blurred and that's the way he saw things so perhaps close your eyes I don't know just one last quick-fire question who's got a quick-fire question okay the member right here with the yellow top for your time. My question concerns ESG. So, ESG, sort of corporate social responsibility. Do you believe that companies have a duty to make sure the supply chains are ethical or fight climate change? Or should the focus always be on? Sorry, sorry. Slow down the minute. You're like fast forward. Do you believe that companies should focus on making sure their supply chains are ethical and fighting climate change, so like the practical impacts? Or should business always really be about making profit and doing deals. There's a balance between being a tree hugger and making money, obviously. We have an environmental responsibility that we have to comply with, a green responsibility we have to comply with as far as packaging and all that stuff is concerned. And yes, it's important for climate change and all that stuff. There's no question of it. But some people take it a little bit too far, you know. And so you have to draw the line somewhere. But one of the companies that I own is a cosmetic company called Tropic Skin Care. And we pride ourselves with all of the materials that we produce are not organic, but they're natural. I produce from natural chemicals and things like that. And we're just about to bring out an organic range also. So I won't say I'm the driver behind that. That's my partner in the business is the one that's really into all this stuff. But it's important. It is important. Recycling and all that type of thing. Very, very important. Great. Thank you very much, Lord Sugar. It's been indeed a very mentalizing and insightful evening. Would you all join me as I thank, Lord Sugar, for visitors today. Thank you.
