 I now look to Matthew Dick to open the case for the opposition. Before I begin my argument tonight, I'd like to thank you, Madam President. Both for deciding to include this vital debate in your term card and for giving me the immense privilege. of speaking in it. The first question I'd like to ask tonight is what exactly are we debating? Largely, I agree with liberty. I've heard lots of people refer to this casually as the porn debate. But to be clear, this is not really a debate by porn. The proposition and the opposition are not disputing the relative merits or evils associated with the porn industry. Rather, it is not the burden of the opposition to defend mainstream porn The opposition believes that the new era of porn found on sites like ONiFans is still fundamentally exploitative, that it does not sufficiently progress the porn industry into a better future, and as such, cannot be welcomed. This is why the wording of the motion is crucial. We are opposing the new era of porn, as manifested in recent years, not a new era of porn, or whether pornography should evolve, as thus. we have no burden to defend mainstream pornography on sites like Mindgeek. So why do I think that the new era of porn is still fundamentally exploitative? There are three reasons in which the new age is fundamentally harmful. First, craters are less vulnerable to large monopolizing platforms. Second, this new age facilitates the grooming of children towards selling sexually explicit imagery. And third, because it creates relationships. between both the creator and the user that have the potential to be exploitative. To propose the motion tonight is not to challenge the flaws of mainstream pornography, but is rather to turn a blind eye to these harms. Before that, it is my juicy and indeed my honour to introduce the speakers of the proposition. Speaking first, you've just heard from Liberty Osborne, a first-year oriental studies student at university college, and would I consider to be a personal friend. I must confess that I was a little surprised when I found out that Liberty was speaking in this debate, given that I'm fairly confident that she set a union record in attempting to resign twice before her term even began. While I may have doubts about her commitment, I cannot felt her confidence. I think she should be commended for going a whole 10-minute speech without even thinking about handing her notice. Following Liberty, you'll hear from Cindy Gallup, the founder of Make Love Not a Minute speech. porn, a website she unveiled an incredibly widely watched TED Talk in 2009, which aims to tackle misconceptions about sex. In preparing for this debate, I watched an interview she did with style like you, during which she removed an item of clothing with every question. While the interview revolutionized my attitude to self-confidence and particular public speaking... I don't know that the house will remain fully attentive tonight, even if I choose to cleat my clothes on during my speech or at least attempt to. And finally, closing out the propositions case is Megan Barton Hanson, a former Love Island star and vice columnist, which she uses to promote positive sexual advice. Many of you may have been expecting me to make some cheap joke about Love Island. However, having considered it, exaggerating yourself on social media, pulling people for a chat to make alliances and pretending to be friends of people for personal gain as an elected member of the Union Committee I feel that I too fit into the bill. Madam President, these are your guests and they are most welcome. Now, I'm acutely aware that I'm in no place to stand at this dispatch botch and lecture you on the relationship between company and creator in the porn industry, especially in the company of so many who are far more knowledgeable than myself. However, as a thoroughly stereotypical teenager, I'm well versed in the golden age of YouTube FIFA 15 pack openings. So thought that I begin by explaining how platform sharing sites leave creators with minors with minimal job security. Much like YouTube in the early 2010s, OnlyFans has a virtual monopoly on this kind of content creation, so much so that it's not synonymous with the new age and indeed this motion. The 2017 YouTube adpocalypse, where many creators had their content demonetized, fundamentally restricted the ability of many YouTubers to use that platform for a full-tide job. When in 2021, OnlyFans had a saga about banning sexually illicit content, sorry, sexually explicit content, this fundamentally revealed the power that that site has to pull the rug out from under the feet of the creators. The simple fact is that OnlyFans, like other content-sharing platforms, will not hesitate to demonetize their creators should the internet landscape change to make that profitable. And this has cannot welcome a system, which provides craters this little protection. Even the large influences on only fans who often have other sources of income through social media or modelling were outraged by this, which they saw as a threat to their livelihoods. Imagine how much more destructive this power that only fans wields is over the smaller crasers for whom it's their single occupation. The proposition tonight's case rests on the claim that the experience of individual craters drastically improves under this new age. To support this conclusion, is to ignore the extreme vulnerability that the newer era of porn perpetuates, particularly amongst the smallest craters who need the most protection. Secondly, this house can never welcome the new era of porn because it doesn't provide sufficient mechanisms with which to regulate content on its platforms, particularly of those who are underage. The Hartfordshire Police reported a recent case of a 14-year-old girl who was selling sexually explicit content on OnlyFans by using her grandmother's child mother's passport and bank account details, which is just one of a number of cases that UK watchdogs and newspapers have uncovered. Sites like OnlyFans are fundamentally unable to regulate their users precisely because of the quality that proposition praises so much, how decentralized they are. The sites are too detached from the fate of their citizens. What has happened since all of these atrocities have been uncovered? Have any of these sites faced? lasting repercussions. No, OnlyFans is entirely unaccountable and merely shut down these accounts. More harmfully, the new age of pornography provides mechanisms which facilitate children being groomed and sexually exploited. I'll use an example of a 17-year-old girl who started selling photos of her feet on Snapchat, before being encouraged by users to sell far more sexually explicit content on OnlyFans. This brings me to the third strand of my analysis, how the new era of porn cultivates harmful parasocial relationships. That is relationships which are totally one-sided, where one individual cares about the other and the other doesn't even acknowledge their existence, which are very frequent between celebrities and their fans or YouTubers and their viewers. These relationships are the exclusive selling point of the new era of porn. It is important to ask ourselves, ourselves, why in an age where there is so much freely and widely available pornography, which is all free, do 50 million people subscribe for rates of about from $5 to $50 a month to only fans' accounts to access sexually explicit content? I believe it is because of these parasycial relationships, because users feel that they are special and that they have an internet relationship with a cracer, which fundamentally is an illusion. Now, this creates dangerous expectations on creators due to the immensely personal connection they have of each individual user in order to fulfill their role as this internet partner. Users can send direct messages to creators offering tips which provide a mechanism that encourages the performance of certain sexual acts. Indeed, the 17-year-old girl who referred to earlier reported that she was encouraged by many of her users in order to post more sexually explicit content because they said that they would subscribe if she did. How can we welcome this new era? Therefore, I think that if you like me and like the proposition must necessarily came, you think that there are calms caused by the way mainstream porn is produced, given that it is funded by men, directed by men, and targeted at men, which blur the boundaries of consent for actors with regards to certain sexual acts, and this content negatively impacts how viewers think about sex, then I'd encourage you to notice the similarities between this and the new era of porn, where predominantly female craters are encouraged to perform certain sexual acts by their predominantly male audience. Users see craters who they frequently represent, not as actors with, as Liberty describes, all the overproduction, the lighting, the scripts, the cameras, but as their partners, performing sexual acts for their, the user's pleasure. This blurring of the real and the fantasy makes the new era of porn as likely, if not more so, to influence users' own sexual relations in a way detrimental both to themselves and their partner as mainstream hardcore pornography. If the proposition calls this house to realise these harmful elements, then I call you not to ignore their persistence into the new era. I don't think that anyone in this chamber tonight doubts the flaws of mainstream pornography. I want to make clear that in no way in my speech am I defending that status quo. But I would, however, urge the members of this House to consider that the mere fact that mainstream pornography might be worse than the new era is not a sufficient reason to welcome this new age. It is true that mainstream porn actors have very little job security, often being flown into a new city, living in a house full of other actors and agents, driven to a number of shoots, and then find themselves unable to get any more work because they were no longer an amateur teen and not yet a milth. It is also true that mainstream pornography has the potential to exploit children as actors and fail to properly regulate itself. It is still true that mainstream pornography has the potential to infringe upon the consensual production of porn and promote dangerous narrative is about sex. The aim of my speech tonight has not been to deny these things, but by appealing to the continuity of these flaws into the new era, convince you to vote to oppose this motion. Thank you very much. The
