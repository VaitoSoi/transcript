 Zach, thank you so much for joining us here today. It's an absolute honour. I'll hand over to say a few words about yourself. honor. I'll hand over to you to say a few words about yourself. It's very cool to be here. Throw in a little Los Angeles lingo. And what a beautiful building. I met some great people earlier with some great questions. So looking forward to sharing stories about McLaren, about Formula One, whatever that is that you might want to chat about. Great. Thanks so much for being here again. And as a reminder to everyone, who's sitting here eagerly tonight, there will be a chance near the end to ask some questions, so you can get them already. So, Zach, let's start, I guess, talking a bit more about your career, which is what a lot of people are here to hear about. So you started as a motorsport driver, and could you tell us a bit more, I guess, what kind of got you into racing in the first place? Absolutely. So my family was not from a racing background, but I enjoyed cars, hot wheels. and racing my brother in big wheels around the block. And my father used to take us to races in Los Angeles, the Long Beach Grand Prix in 1981, which Williams won, was the first race I ever went to. And it just made a huge impression on me. We'd go to the drag races. We'd go to the sports car races, the IndyCar races. And then in high school, one of my best buddies, his family was into racing. We went back to the Long Beach Grand Prix. in 1987 and got the chance to meet Mario Andretti, one of my heroes. He'd won the race. And I asked him, how do you get started in racing? He said, carting. And there was an ad in the race program. I had been on Wheel of Fortune, teen week, and won a bunch of his and her watches, which I then went and sold at a pawn shop, bought my first goat cart, and that's how I got started in racing. Wow, that's an interesting story, definitely. It's definitely unique. Unique, yeah, definitely. I guess, obviously, you do a lot of management side right now. What kind of inspired that transition to go into management after? Not being fast enough in the race car. Because I'd much rather be in Lando or Daniels suit, but I won't fit in it anymore. So, you know, I've been around racing my entire life. I raced for 10 years. I lived here in the early 90s. in Sheffield and Wakefield, Sheffield being the land of Def Leppard. And I loved it. I've been coming to England and Europe ever since. And then when I hung up my helmet, so to speak, I then started a motorsports agency looking after the corporate side of the sport, built that up to be the largest motorsports agency, and then sold that to Chim Communications, which was a London PLC. it then got acquired by Providence Equity and did that for three, four years, which was across all sports. I didn't really enjoy that because I'm just a racing guy. And I got the opportunity to either go to Formula One or McLaren, and McLaren had always been my favorite racing team. I liked that I had the opportunity to maybe get it into other disciplines in addition to Formula One, which were now an IndyCar and Extreme E. and yeah, it was an awesome opportunity and been there since the end of 16 and absolutely love it. Great. Would you say that your journey as a driver and actually being in the sport has kind of giving you skills that have helped you along this management journey? Yeah, I think definitely. A lot of similarities. So when you're a driver, you're the quarterback, but you also need to be able to rely on your engineers and your team. You're only as good as the car that you have and the team that you have around you. Communication is critical. Taking risks, calculated risks. When can you hurt yourself? When might not you hurt yourself? You have to think very quick. So I think there's a lot of similarities between driving and management in that sense. Definitely. I know you mentioned teamwork and only being as quick as the car and the team around you. kind of found your sense of teamwork to be built by working in racing? I really enjoy being in a team atmosphere. That was one of the reasons why I wanted to go to a Formula One team, as opposed to maybe be purely on the kind of commercial management side. And it, you know, there's a lot of very smart people in Formula One teams and engineers and scientists. And I find it very fascinating. It's also well above my intelligence level often. So being able to kind of build a team, we're about 900 people, a best in class, and then try and put everyone together to be a world-class sports team. That's a big challenge and a lot of fun when you get it right. And when you don't get it right, you come back and it really motivate you. So I'm very much motivated by the fear of failure. So I kind of feel if we're not moving forward all the times, there is no neutral. You're either going front or back. And you've got to kind of learn from your mistakes and have a great team around you. I mean, speaking of world-class sports team, I think the McLaurin, you know, Formula One team is one that has been improving significantly year-on-year. So I just wanted to ask, what do you think you've kind of brought, like what changes have you made that have kind of pushed this development? fostering teamwork. It's, you know, it's all about people. I think any business, whether you're a racing team or a pharmaceutical company or whatever, it's all about the people. When I came in, I thought we lacked a lot of leadership. So it didn't change that many people, just changed what I thought were the right people. People want to be led. People want to have clarity. People want to know when they're doing a good job when they're not doing a good job. And, you know, in Formula One, it is truly a team effort. You know, it can be a driver that can crash, an engine that blows up, a wheelnut that doesn't go on. So everyone's job to perform at the highest level is critically important. And so we just set, you know, Formula One teams love data. So we got everyone in a position where they understood from a data standpoint, what do they need to do in their role and what a success look like. And it's a momentum business. And I think we turn the momentum around. We still have a long way to go. But we're in, I like the direction we're headed. Interesting. I know obviously management is a really big part of teamwork and building this team. How would you say your management style kind of differentiates from other bosses, you know, within the Formula One world? Well, it's definitely better. So I, you know, we're racing cars around Monte Carlo. So you've got to take it pretty seriously, but we are racing cars around Monte Carlo. So I like to have fun and have an environment. You know, I think when you look at Daniel and Lando, we have fun in the garage and don't mistake that for not being extremely serious and focused. But, you know, we're racing 23 times around the world. We're working 24-7 most of the time. And so if you're not a pleasant person to be around or having fun or looking after your teammates, then I don't think you get the most out of people. So that's something I enjoy. I'm a racer, which kind of the shop floor, if you'd like, I think likes someone that has an appreciation for racing. And then giving constant and quick feedback in a productive. manner, but not holding back from giving, you know, constructive criticism, but letting people know it's only because we're trying to improve. And I do that myself. I'll walk out of here tonight and there'll be something. I'll go, I wish I would have said that a little bit differently. So I'm constantly critiquing myself and that's what you need to do in a racing team because, you know, they talk about the perfect lap. There is no perfect lap. The minute you think there's a perfect lap, you've kind of kidding yourself and you're not trying to continuously improve. I mean, Zach, I know from talking to you that you absolutely love your job, you know, it's very enjoyable. But I guess what I want to ask is what are some of the challenges you face? Because I'm guessing it's not playing solely on every single day for you. Well, we've got unbelievable competition, right? So that's a tough place to get started. Then we're having to deal with COVID, like the rest of the world. And that's tough on business. That's tough on our people. That's tough on how we navigate and travel. So I think we're all in a new world of how we've had to adapt. I'm very proud of how McLaren and Formula One have addressed, tackled in COVID. It's not behind us, but I think we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Sponsorship, you know, we have two main forms of revenue. There's prize money that we get from Formula One with how we finish. And then we have to bring in corporate partners. that's not easy because there's a lot of great places for corporations to spend money. And then it's a very political, competitive sport. So you've got to be on your toes all the time. But I enjoy that part of the sport. Yeah. I mean, you mentioned the political side of things. Would you care to elaborate a bit more on some of the challenges you face within that realm? Yeah, I mean, the teams were trying to take each other's people. we're trying to take each other's sponsors. And then at times, actually often, you're trying to disrupt other teams. So you may, as an example, know some drivers are coming up and you're actually in a good place with your drivers, but you might play around a little bit just to destabilize what the competition is trying to do. So there's a lot of games that go on on the track and off the track. I think Netflix has done a great job of exposing what goes on, you know, before the race starts. Yeah. I mean, I think the Netflix documentary is something for everyone to watch if they haven't watched it yet already. But in terms of you and like your most memorable moments, obviously you've had like a long career in racing, what are some of the highlights for you and some of the moments that you really look back and, you know, smile upon? Well, definitely Monza this year. The one two was awesome, especially the way we, you know, we just went out and won it and we didn't inherit it. You know, the two title guys tangled up, but they were already behind us. So that was a very proud moment, winning LaMalle with my United AutoSports team. So you've got Formula One, bringing Fernando Alonzo to the Indy 500. in 2017, was awesome. Bringing Fernando to Indianapolis in 2019 sucked. But you've got to learn from those, and I think we leaned into that, understand what mistakes were made there. And then kind of my old racing, a couple victories that were super special. But I'd like to think the kind of best, are still ahead. Yeah. I think obviously we have these great moments, but how do yourself personally, but also like the team, how do you handle those less great days, so to say? You learn from what's gone wrong. One of the things, and I had this when I started in 17, we had a bad race car, we were nowhere, and there's only so much development you could do, and that was a difficult year because you knew at the first race we were going to have 20 more like this because it was so far off. And that was hard trying to keep everyone's morale up. You go indie car racing, which is a different type of formula where we're all using the same cars so you can have a good weekend and a bad weekend, two weekends apart. In a Formula One team, if you've built a bad race car, that's what you have for the year. So I found that to be frustrating showing up to a race weekend knowing it was going to be a bad race weekend. But that seems like a long time ago. And all you do is you get the right people that want to power through the problems and keep their head up. Yeah, I think that's definitely, you know, a great mentality to have in these situations. So in terms of McLaren and next season, are there, I guess, any aims you have that you're trying to fulfill any goals? Yeah, we always have goals, you know, our realistic goals to try and get closer to whoever the fastest team is. It's obviously historically been Mercedes and Red Bull here the last five, six years. So our goal is to get closer, have better pit stops. We were the best team in launches at the start, so we want to maintain that. Our pit stops were pretty poor a couple years ago. Now they're getting to be pretty good. So we have room to go there. Our reliability is good. We want to get into Q3, final qualifying as often as possible, and have more podiums. We brought in investment, and we still have some technical infrastructure, most notably a simulator and a wind tunnel that's still under construction. So until we get that, we do have a little bit of a hand tie behind our back. So I don't think we're going to be a championship contest. this year, I'd like to think we could be in a position to win a race or two. Interesting. In terms of like regulation change, are there anything you're trying to push for at the moment? Yeah, so the regulation change this year is the single largest change in Formula One's modern day history. I'd like to see the governance of the sport be less in the hands of the teams. We're all conflicted. So we, you know, if this was a, we go have these Formula One board meetings, a normal board, all the teams would have to accuse themselves because we're all conflicted on what we're voting on. And I think the teams have more control than we should, and that fosters itself in inconsistent regulations. And you've got to believe Formula One and the FIA have what's in the best interest of the sport. So I'd rather them make more of the decisions. The governance for the new contract is better than the old contract, but I still don't think it's gone far enough. Yeah, I mean, I guess that links to what you were saying before about it being political in a sense. And there's different levels of voting, depending on what the topic is and what time a year it is. So if we want to make a rule change for at 2023, we have one level of votes that need to go through, if it's before, I think it's May 1st, and another level, a higher threshold after May 1st. And that higher threshold is almost impossible to get something through because of the different inner team relationships. And that needs to be reduced. I think we should have a say, but I don't think we should have a vote. Interesting. Interesting. I mean, I know. most of us here will know you as the CEO of McLaren, but you're also the co-owner of United Autosports. So it would be great if you could tell us, I guess, a bit more about that team and what led you to be involved in it. Yeah, so I'm a racing junkie. So I want to be at a race as often as possible. Where that came about is my best mate, Richard Dean. When I moved here in the early 90s, he was racing in former 3,000. And I wanted to get back into racing in 2009, not professionally, but just to enjoy it. I had sold part of my company. And I wanted to kind of do it the Formula One way. So Richard and I started this team with really just the intention of me driving. And then it blossomed. I stopped driving. Now we've won LaMalle. We have about 60 employees. We're racing three different championships. We have a team in Australia with Michael Andretti and Walkinshaw in supercars. We've got a team in Extreme E with Michael Andretty. And I absolutely love it. And for me, it's a stress relief. You know, some people I like to golf as well, golf at the weekends or have a hobby. Mine is United Auto Sports, but it's definitely not a hobby team for Richard. He does it very professionally. But for me, it's an enjoyable weekend off. Great. I mean, with Formula One, you're obviously very involved in that. How would you kind of compare that to other racing events? What would you say about the differences between them? So I love all forms of motorsport, but Formula One is the pinnacle. They're the fastest cars, they're the greatest drivers. There's kind of more money on the line. And I don't necessarily mean that just financially, even though that is the case. The development, the size of the teams, the complete. complexity of the sport. But I very much love IndyCar racing in North America. It's some of the best racing. It's got the Indy 500. Lamont is an awesome event, which, you know, McLaren's the only team to have won the Triple Crown, Indy 500, Monte Carlo and Lamar. I'd love to see us go back to Lamar in the future. So they're all different disciplines, and there are different things I really enjoy about the different forms of racing. Great. I think with Formula One, obviously it's a great thing. People, you know, they get onto their TVs, they watch it, they get tickets, they go to, you know, the games and everything. But there's obviously been a lot of criticisms over the past few years. So I guess it would be great to get your perspective on some of these and what you think Formula One can do to be more inclusive and more welcoming to people. So in terms of, sorry, I think one of the critics that has been faced by Formula One is that it's not meritocratic enough. I don't know what you would say on that. So I think Liberty bought the sport at the end of 2016, and I think they've done a wonderful job. And I think the criticisms of Formula One being more inclusive, fan access, things of that nature, I think were very fair at the time. I think while we still have a long way to go, Liberty, and I think Netflix is a great example of that, they've really opened up the sport. And so now for the first time, it's all about the fans. That's how it should have been in the first place. Without fans, we don't have countries that want to hold races. Without fans, we don't have TV broadcasters. Without fans, we don't have sponsors. Without all of that, there is no Formula One. And I think now Liberty has kind of changed the mindset of the industry, and we're all about the fans. And I think the fans are responding to that. We weren't digitally savvy as a sport. I think now we are. Sustainability is a big issue around the world and something that we at McLaren are tackling as our Formula One. I think we have a long way to go. I think we're sustainability. It's kind of a journey where you never reach your final destination. gender equality is very important to us in the sport. That's one of the reasons why we entered extreme. You have a male and a female driver. And we race in five different places around the world that focuses on climate change that's been driven by sustainability. And under the sustainability umbrella, if you'd like, there's fiscal, there's climate. There's all sorts of challenges the world faces. And I think McLaren, we have four key pillars. It's we're all about our fans. We're all about our employees. We're all about our corporate partners in building their business. And then we're all about sustainability and how can we take our knowledge and know how and contribute. And I think a great example of that is the ventilator challenge that the UK government asked a handful of manufacturing and Formula One teams. And we produced 10 years of ventilators in about 10 weeks. And so that was using our people, our knowledge, our know-how to not only entertain the world, but actually try and make a difference. Definitely. And I think this example of the ventilators just shows how everyone can come together in moments of crisis and work to, you know, help better the community. But also on this topic of sustainability, would you say, because I know there are a lot of climate protesters who say that, you know, Formula One does not take climate emissions seriously enough. Do you think a lot has been done to make sure that we're moving to, you know, cleaner vehicles that are going to have less of an impact on our society in the world? Yeah, I think it's early days in our journey. I know we take it very seriously. I know Formula One takes it very seriously. We're looking at different fuels. We've got hybrid. The power units are the most thermal efficient engines in the world. I think without boring everyone with statistics because they're saying, you know, perception is reality. I think the perception is kind of Formula One of the good old days and you put a starter in the back and out comes smoke, you fire up an engine now. You don't even need earplugs. And the carbon footprint, if you'd like, of the actual race cars going around the racetrack is less than 1%. We're like any other global sport, which is flying around the world. So I think we can maybe look at logistically doing that in a more efficient manner. But it's a very serious topic that the entire sport is taking very seriously. But I think we have a long way to go. Okay. Do you think there's been a lot of improvements on, you know, stereotypes regarding Formula One and racing in general, just being for men and for guys? Do you think we've made progress as time has gone on? Or is it still a really big issue within the field? No, I think those that follow the sport, you know, the sports really evolved in that sense. I think if people, and it's probably no different than my perceptions of things if I'm not really knowledgeable on, I just kind of have a perception and therefore an opinion that isn't necessarily a fact-based opinion. So I think people that follow Formula One have seen the change. People that don't follow Formula One and maybe just think back to James Hunt's movie. I think that's what Formula One looks like today, and it's not. So I do think we need to do a better job of communicating to people. And I think, again, coming back to Netflix, it's taken so many people. First of all, it's driven a huge female fan base, which is awesome, a younger fan base. And I can't tell you how many people I've heard go, I've never watched Formula One, and now I won't miss Formula One. So I think what we need to do is we need to get Formula One more exposed. Yeah, I know we've mentioned this Netflix documentary a couple of times. So I guess I'd love to get your opinion on it. Do you think this media tension has been beneficial for the sport? Or I guess some people could say it's just kind of increasing tensions between some of the teams. What would you say has been like the overall impact of this documentary? I think it's been awesome for the sport. I think it's really shown people what happens in our great sport. I think it at times has created more tension with the teams, but I think that's a good thing. And, you know, if you look at Abu Dhabi at the end of the year, that fell a little bit victim to everyone wanting to be on TV. I think the race director couldn't fully focus because he had a couple team bosses coming into them. I think they wanted to be on TV a little bit too much. So I think we need to kind of course correct that. I think we're going to pull back from the communication. You know, you wouldn't be able to have a coach go run up to a ref on the field. And that we had a little bit of that going on. That being said, from a television standpoint, I think it's been fascinating. But I think overall Netflix has been wonderful for the sport. Great. I mean, speaking of media campaigns, I had a look through McLaren's YouTube channel. What do you think you guys have done to, I guess, connect with everyday fans and make it seem like they're all part of the team? say to say? Well, they are part of the team. And a lot of what we do is in response to what our fans want. You know, we were, I was, when I started, for those of you that have seen our building, it kind of looks like Star Wars. But we became Darth Vader, very dark, cold, not friendly. And I wanted us, and I had Mark Hamill in here at some time ago. I wanted us to become more Luke Skywalker. So still playing the Star Wars, but, you know, be on the good side. And so we changed the color of our car to papaya because that's what our fans wanted. That's our historical color. So a lot of what we do is driven by what do we think our fans want from us. And so this past year was the largest ever Formula One study done on favorite drivers, favorite teams. And we came out on top. It was the most popular team, most popular driver lineup, which was awesome. And I think that's the fans talking to us. And that's where digital is changed the landscape of the world, where, you know, 10, 20 years ago, we would talk to our fans, but we couldn't hear them. And now with digital, you get feedback very quickly. And fortunately, most of it's good, but when it's not, you learn from that as well. And you understand, you know, we've made mistakes. Or then when we did our Gulf merchandise drop, we didn't have enough merchandise. We didn't anticipate the demand. So we let some fans down that, you know, in Australia, we were sold out. So a lot of people in Australia woke up, just saw the announcement, wanted to order it, and was already sold out. And so, you know, we disappointed them. It was a good problem to have. So you get that feedback and then you respond accordingly. And then, of course, I think our drivers, Lando and Daniel, are definitely two of the fan favorites. What you see is what you get with them. that is who they are. And yeah, without fans, there is no McClare. Definitely. I know you mentioned two of the drivers. How do you think for the drivers it is? Because I actually watched a YouTube video with them in it. How do you think it is for them, I guess, being under the spotlight and being under scrutiny, so to say, from a lot of people worldwide? They enjoy it. I, you know, it can get a little frustrating at times because they can make an innocent, mistake, something that's maybe not totally politically correct today. You know, the world's gone to a place now where you have to be very careful with everything you say, you do, you joke about. And, you know, we're all human and we all have a sense of humor. So I think that can be a bit frustrating for them at times, where they're just kind of being themselves, maybe let their guard down. But overall, they enjoy it. You know, Lando's new to it. Daniel's a big character. love them. So, you know, I've never seen them not stop and sign an autograph or take a picture, talk to fans. But, but, you know, it's tough out there. I had once, we had some of the royalty come to the factory, and I didn't know, you're not supposed to put your hands in your pockets. I had a tie on. I thought I was quite fancy. And in comes Prince William, and I had my hands in You would have thought I shot the guy. People went nuts. And that was a good example of no one kind of, I didn't get the brief. But then when I met the Prince of Wales up at COP 26, my hand's going to go anywhere near my pockets. Wow, that's definitely interesting. I guess you must have had many other similar exciting moments during your time of CEO. Are there any others you'd like to share with us? Well, race results are always great. you meet fascinating people. So that's always very enjoyable. And then I think you've got to stay grounded that you get a lot of opportunity as the McLaren CEO. So enjoy it while you can because you won't always be the McLaren CEO. There will be another one that comes around, hopefully in a long time away in a galaxy far, far away. But yeah, I mean, you just, you get to see and meet unbelievable people, whether it's politicians or other sports people or CEOs, and I've always enjoyed learning from other people. So McClaren's a great brand to be associated with. Definitely. I mean, I know we're all hoping this time will come, like you said, a long, long time away, but do you have any other ambitions beyond Formula One that you're kind of interested in? No, it's just McLaren for me. Nice. Nice. We're loving the dedication, loving the dedication here. So, yeah, I mean, I guess within McLaren, is there any new ventures that we should keep an eye out for or anything upcoming? So Extremie, which is a second year in championship first for us with the first Formula One team to enter it. We have Emma Gilmore, our first female driver, which we're quite excited about. She's a champion from New Zealand, which is where Bruce McLaren, our founder, is from. So that's pretty cool. Our first race is in Saudi in a few weeks. That's something we're very excited about. And then this weekend, on Friday, I should say, we're launching all of our family of cars, our e-sports team, our IndyCar team, our extremity, and, of course, Formula One. So that's going to be an exciting moment. Great. Well, thanks so much, Zach, for answering these questions. I now want to turn to the audience. So, you know, if anyone has any questions, and just, you know, raise your hand up while we have a lot already. But yeah, do you want to ask your question? Yeah, Zach, thank you for a good talk today. My question is very simple. Who is the better golfer, you Orlando? That's easy. Me, but I've got about a 20-year head start on them. So you asked me that question in a year. Unfortunately, it's probably going to be a different answer. Great. Do you want to ask your question? Thank you very much for that talk. It was fantastic. I suppose I've got two questions really. First one, everybody really enjoyed the Max versus Hamilton battle this year, but you versus Ferrari was also one of the main highlights. Where do you see yourself against them this coming year? And also, can you give us a sneak peek of the 22 car? You know, there is no reason why Ferrari can't compete for the championship. this year. So it's really hard to know where anyone's going to be because we don't have any data from last year relevant to this year's car. We're just working on simulation, which we're very good at, but normally you have some data to pull over. Their driver lineup is extremely strong. Obviously, Carlos drove for us, so I'm not surprised he gave Charles a run for his money. So it's hard to know where we're going to be against them, but I also think they have a real chance to challenge Mercedes and Red Bulls. because they have all the resources and the technology infrastructure that they need. So they've been kind of in a slump, but I could see them catching up very, very quickly. And then I'm sorry, your second part of your question was, oh, the sneak peek. So I'd show it to you, it's on my phone, but I have my phone on me. What I can tell you is it's very, it's papaya and blue. We've changed the shade a little bit, and it's going to be very vibrant. and it's a pickup on this year's car, but definitely looks different and it has more sponsors on it, and I hope it's faster than last year. Great. Do you want to ask your question? Hi, thank you for being here. I originally was going to ask if we could see your Monsa tattoo, but you're wearing a suit, so I think we're not going to subject you to that. I don't recommend them. My question was about a little bit about McLaren's trajectory over the last three Cs, obviously there's been a massive improvement in how it's performed in the constructors championship. And I was wondering how much of that you'd attribute to the decision to bring in Andrea Seidel, what he's brought to the team and what makes him, I guess, a good team principle, you know, in your opinion. Thank you. Absolutely. So when we changed leadership in the Formula One team, I temporarily went on the pit wall. But I knew I needed to get off that before I got found out. And Andreas, I knew from Lamont, you know, he ran Porsche's team. And, you know, needed someone very technical that focuses purely on the performance of the Formula One team. My role is to look after the business and get the right people in place, get them the right resources, give them the right direction, manage the board and the shareholders, et cetera. So Andreas was who we wanted. He had been tied up at Porsche, it took a little bit to get to get the board. them out of there. Prior to that, I brought in James Key, who was our technical director. So it was about getting the right leadership in place. And it takes about six months to identify, about six months to hire, and then they're all under contract. So sometimes it takes six to 12 months to get them. So it can be a two-year journey from start to finish. Fortunately, now we have all the technical leadership that we want, and I've got all the business leadership that I want. I've about six people that report to me that make up the leadership team. And so it was about getting the right people in place, creating momentum, and then we brought in investment a little over a year ago to give us the financial resources we needed to get back to the front, to get a new wind tunnel, things of that nature. So we're on our way, but we still have a little bit ways to go. Great. Wow, a lot more questions now. But the member in the green jumper, would you guys ask your question? Hi, Zach. It's interesting to hear your views on the Formula X event as a new hope for climate change. Do you see it getting bigger than Formula E? or do you still see Formula One leading in terms of views and interest across the world? Where do you see Formula X in the future? Yeah, I think nothing will compete with Formula One. It's been around a long time. Its size, its scope is just, you know, it's the largest annual single sporting series. So I don't think anything knocks that off its mantle. I do think you've got a variety of sports that people love, right? I presume you like more than whatever your sport of choice may be. And I think motor racing is very much the same. If you like motor racing, you'll have a favorite, but you'll like other forms. And I think extreme, it's got short form content. So I think it's a great media play for today's day and age. And I think it has a great place in highlighting climate change. We go to five different territories where climate has impacted, whether it's in, Greenland or Saudi or Sardinia. And so I think it's going to have its role within motorsports, but it's not necessarily going to compete with Formula One. Great. I'll take one from the back now. I think you're wearing a blue puffer. My question is on the business side of things. As McLaren looks to expand to Formula E and you guys already in the indie sports series, How does it look like when you restructure, do you have to take people out from the Formula One team effort into the extreme effort? And is the budget cap coming in? Is that going to help at all with splitting up the teams and hopefully getting closer to the top teams in Formula One? Yep, absolutely. So when we enter a new form of motorsport, there's a few common criteria. We have to feel it fits our brand, you know, does it kind of make sense that McClan? in it. And I think in that sense, extremie was disruptive, because I don't think we don't have a history in off-road racing. Has to be commercially viable. Has to have a big fan following. And it has to be additive to our other racing activities and not distracting, whether that's operationally or or economically. So as I've looked to build out the McLaren portfolio of racing, you've got Formula 1, which is our center of gravity. You've got IndyCar to address a bigger North American marketplace. You have Extremie to help address sustainability and gender equality. And you've got esports as grassroots in the younger generation. So when you put those all together, we've got a broader commercial offering. So when our partners come in, they can kind of dial up and dial down whatever fits in accordance to what their goals are. The budget cap has allowed us to not have to make as many people redundant and be able to place them in some of the other racing activities. But we do try and separate them because what we don't ever want to do, because then you're compromising one series, is put a team member in a position where they have to decide, should I do Formula One or IndyCar? Because whatever the decision is, you're then compromising the other. So each team does have dedicated resources and shares on our technology and know-how when it makes sense. Great. I'll take the question here. Hello. My question's a bit cheeky because it's from my brother, and he can't be here today. He raced alongside you at Bayford Meadows in 20, and that did so much great work for improving accessibility and making Formula One visible. But I guess he wants to know what can be done to improve access into Formula One and motorsport because it's so heavily stereotyped as a sport that is inaffordable and inaccessible to people that don't have millions of pounds. Yeah, that's a good question. And I think the sport can do that a lot digitally. I mean, the reality is you have 300,000 people at Silverstone over the course. course of a weekend and getting 300,000 people through pit lane just physically not possible. We try and bring our drivers to the fans. They go visit grandstands. And I think digital is a great way to have people feel engaged. We have WebEx as a partner. So we do a lot of video calls, which gives people a real ability to interact with the drivers. And then coming back to Netflix, That's a way to show everybody what is going on behind the scenes because historically, it's been a very closed shop. So we have hundreds of millions of fans. I'd love to be able to put every single one through our garage. It's not possible, so we've got to figure out how can we bring our garage to our fans. And we have a product that's called Slipstream, which is effectively a pre- and post-game show that we do from our garage, that are part. partners use and our fans get access to through competitions where they can actually see what is going on in the garage. So I think we're getting there. I'd love to see the paddock open or more open at times, but it's a challenge when you have 300,000 great fans that would all get sprinting for your garage at the same time. Great. I'll take the question over there. Hi, Zach. Hi, Zach. Thank you so much for a talk today, even as a Mercedes fan. Two questions for you today. One, I wanted to ask you what your thoughts on about the A slash B team kind of dynamic in Formula One, you know, between Red Bull and Alforduri, to some degree between Mercedes and Williams. Do you think that's like the way to go forward in the sports, or do you think that's a detriment? And do you ever see McLaren taking on Beat Team? My second question is, what are your thoughts on your MCL 36 being leaked online yesterday via an advertisement to your new Lego set? So I'll answer the first one, second one first. That's not our car. So I saw some noise that our car had leaked, but that's actually, I think I'm right, Tim. Good. It's our older car and a new product that's coming out. So fortunately, knock on wood, it hasn't leaked. I think the A-B team scenario for Formula One is terrible. That's an area that we need to get rid of. Formula One has always been about being a constructor. And what ends up happening is the B teams get artificially competitive. because they haven't had to do all the same hard work that the other teams. And then the A teams benefit because they get information from the B team. Now, that's what happens technically. So I think that's not good for the sport. But even worse, politically, you'll see B teams voting against their best interest because it's in the best interest of the A team. And they won't get what they need from the A team if they don't vote for them. So that's another reason why I think the teams need to have less say from a governance standpoint because you have teams that you sit there that aren't anywhere near the budget cap, as an example, who will vote for raising the budget cap. And you just go, that just makes no sense whatsoever. So that's going to be something that we talk about often. We continue to push on because it's a new phenomenon. You didn't really have that many years ago. You did have the Benetton and Lijé in the 90s, and that got. banned, but there's too much insider trading, if you'd like, and that's not a very nice word, but it is what it is, that goes on between some and A and B teams, and I think we've got to stop that. Great. I'll take the question over here. So thank you again for the talk. A lot has been written about the new technical regulations that going to come in for next season. And fans certainly have high hopes that they're going to kind of make racing closer and give kind of closer racing. And I guess you have the same hopes as kind of a racer at heart. Now that you're so close to releasing the car and have been able to have some simulator runs, how close are we to kind of achieving those hopes and seeing some of that for next season? Ultimately, we don't know yet. Now in simulator, you're always looking for. for optimum performance out of the race car. So none of the simulation that we do is really geared around following other cars and passing. You'll identify some of that in the wind tunnel. I think when new rules come out, someone's gonna get it right, someone's gonna get it wrong, but over time, and I think added to it with the budget cap, because now you can't just keep spending money, I do think the racing will be closer, more competitive. It may take a year or two to see that come together, but I'd be surprised right now a driver can't get within about five seconds before they start feeling the turbulence. And I'd love to see us eventually not be dependent upon DRS, which is now a tool that we need because you can't get close enough to follow. You look at IndyCar racing, they have pushed a pass, so they do that through power as opposed to aerodynamics. So I do think it's going to be better. I'm very optimistic. This is going to be an exciting season because I think there will be some unknowns. I just don't know what those unknowns will be. Great. I think this might have to be our last question for this evening. But the member right at the back, wearing a mask. Hi, Zach. I'd be interested to know about the integration between the McLaren racing side, the Formula One and the others, and the McLaren roadcar side. On the engineering side, a lot of the innovations in Formula One can seem extremely technical, you know, the size of the rear wing. So how much of that percolates into road cars and sort of further down into road cars which ordinary users can buy, you know, your like a Renault or Ford car, for instance? Thank you. Yeah, it's a good question. It takes time to go from a Grand Prix car to a road car. We're building parts to last 200 miles. They're building parts to last 200,000. miles. There is a combination, you know, everyone thinks of Formula One in racing and pure performance, you know, speed, so brakes, power. A lot of safety is developed in roadcars. We were the first roadcar company to exclusively use carbon fiber tubs. We were the first Formula One team to develop carbon fiber tubs, which are now, of course, routine in all forms of major single-seater, motorsport and sports cars. The paddle shift, which is now and everybody's road car was developed in motor racing. Go way back, the seat belt and the rearview mirror were developed in Indianapolis Motor Speedway 100 plus years ago. So there's not as much as you would think that comes off of our race car this year that goes into our road car next year, but you also get a lot of material development, light weighting, crash structures, and then training of knowledge and know-how, of engineers, scientists on how to problem-solve and how to approach design. So it's less about take that suspension off the form of the one and put it on the road car. But the ideation, the development, the technology that goes into developing the suspension, you take that same knowledge and know-how, and sometimes those people, and they sit in your road car division and they take that same discipline and that's how we develop our road cars. Thank you. So that will have to be our last question for today, but just wanted to say a thank you to you all for coming to this event and I hope to see you all at our debate on Thursday. And a big thank you to Zach. My pleasure. I'm
