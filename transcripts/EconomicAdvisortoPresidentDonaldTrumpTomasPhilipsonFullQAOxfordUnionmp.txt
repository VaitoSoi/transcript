 Thank you so much Dr. Thank you so much Dr. Philipson for joining us today. Thanks for having me. Yeah, so I thought it would be good to start recent, because, you know, last couple of years have been massive in terms of everything going on, really. And you served as a president Trump's chief economist during the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. And in the early months of 2020, various figures in the Trump administration, including yourself, called the Dan epidemic under control and not a big threat. What decision-making process and data informs such a judgment? And in hindsight, do you think that judgment was correct? So it's like they say in economics, if you can invest after the fact, everyone would be a trillionaire because you can see what happened. And you just buy low and sell high. So at the time when those kind of, that was sort of the administration's view at the time I said it. So it wasn't something that I said, you know, contrary to anyone else in the administration. But that was actually HHS, which is the Department of Health and Human Services position. at that time. So we didn't know initially what would happen. No one knew. And that was essentially the White House took the lead, I think, from the HHS in terms of how we would predict what was going to happen. And I was just kind of reflecting that view. After the fact, obviously, it was the incorrect view. But like I said, if you know, you know what's certain what's going to happen, it's a lot easier than at the time you're saying it, put it that way. Yeah, absolutely. I imagine making judgments of any kind at the time must have been quite, quite difficult. And kind of since the pandemic, I guess many developed countries have faced new challenges of lots of kinds, including the highest inflation rate in decades and unprecedented supply chain problems. In your judgment, as an economist, are the casual variable, what do you think are the casual variables of these economic phenomena, and what kind of policy responses do you think you would prescribe to, these problems. Yes, so what happened with the pandemic obviously it's a one in a hundred year event so people are not routinely sort of dealing with these things and what happened in the US was that we got a massive fiscal response first of all we shut the country down essentially in in the second half of March 2020 which led to enormous drop in economic activity but then at the same time not far after that we had a huge fiscal response in trying to help people to carry through that shutdown in some sense, which was not unique to the US, so very many other countries doing it, including the UK. But the corona recession was unique in the US history because it was the first recession where disposable income went up as opposed to down in a recession, meaning disposable income is your private income plus the government transfers that you get. So basically in all previous recessions, disposable income go down with the recession which is a natural consequence. But this time it was kind of an overreaction in that sense from the US government that we have so much government transfer that people became richer with this huge shock that happened to the on average. Not everyone obviously there was a lot of heartache and troubles with the pandemic in terms of in terms of their economic well-being, people got unemployed or stuff, but on average, when we're talking about these statistics, aggregate statistics, so it's average statistic, and that never happened before in the US. Yeah, no, definitely. I guess by training, you're kind of a health economist, and so maybe we can... Kind of a health economist, yeah. I'm the biggest. So we can move that way, I guess. The US spends as a percentage of GDP the most on healthcare of any developed nation. And there's lots of deliberation about this. Many politicians and some policy experts have deemed as a serious problem and prescribed a wide range of policies, ranging from kind of single-payer system, which I know you oppose, to a public option to Swiss-like enforcement of mandatory individual purchase of private health insurance. What's kind of your opinion on these policies? and what policy prescriptions, if any, would you have for the American healthcare system? Okay, so what's unique in the US relative to many developed countries, particularly in Europe, is that we have private markets for health care as opposed to being a single payer or a single buyer or financer. So we have health care insurance where you pay a premium to a health care insurance company and they pay for your hospital care, your drugs, etc. You have a different system which is you pay a tax, which is not voluntary but mandatory. So your mandatory premium goes to the government and then you have a single monopoly, the government providing healthcare through the NHS in the UK. So, you know, if you're a free market person, that doesn't sound so great. You have a mandatory payment and a monopoly providing the service. And I think from many people, we see the different. we see the difference between U.S. healthcare and European health care in many respects. The free market pricing is important because we don't have, whenever you have a government provided health care, you have low prices for the patients or consumers, which means what you have what economists call excess demand, more demand than their supply. That's why you have waiting times in all European countries, but you don't have waiting times in the U.S. essentially. More importantly, I think the private pricing in the US supports the rest of the world, particularly in medical product development devices, drugs, and biologics, where manufacturers make about 75% of their profits in the US from selling a drug worldwide. So what if the US undertook the UK policy? That would really hurt the UK, because essentially now the incentive to innovate has gone down and what the European countries are doing in my opinion is relying on that financing of R&D expenditure, which costs about $2 billion to bring a drug to market in the U.S. And if that was shut down with European-style pricing of drugs, for example, you would have a massive loss in health in the future, not only in the U.S., but across the world who sees this flow, which is implicitly. financed by the US private market. So I think it's easy to argue that yes we have very high prices. On the other hand I think those prices support the health of not only the US but also other countries in the world. Yeah definitely so I guess you would be very much in favor of a private health care system and we can delve into that a bit more so the US is hardly the only country with the private health care system. Like I said the Swiss have one, albeit with mandatory private health insurance, the Dutch and Germans have private components to their healthcare system, albeit with a public subsidy and government guardrails in the case of the former, and a mixture of public and private provision in the case of the latter. Some would argue that in terms of expenditure, efficiency and outcomes, the Swiss, Dutch and German systems outperformed that of the US. What would be your kind of response to that? I don't think so. I mean, if you look at The ideal system in my view is you want to help poor people to have health care. You don't want to leave poor people behind. We have a system in the US or a program called Medicaid, which is the program for the poor people in the population. If you're above certain assets, if you're above a certain income and below certain assets, you qualified to have public, the government help you by healthcare. I don't think anyone wants the poor to die because they're too poor. The question then becomes, what do you do with the middle and upper income? And should it be publicly financed, which I don't believe in, because I think, you know, in terms of quality-adjusted care, what you get for your taxes in the UK is a lot worse than we get for our premiums in the U.S. And you don't see it really because you don't think about that the tax is actually kind of a premium. But if you do that calculation, a lot of what U.S. provides through the private market, is higher quality just the prices, something. So for example, there's been studies of cancer care. If you get a given cancer, if you're in the European, if you're European citizen versus US citizen, you live a lot longer, conditional on the cancer and conditional on the stage of the cancer. The cancer can be, you know, stage one, two, three, four. And if you look at those differences, they're quite large, large, meaning that you kind of get what you pay for in the European system compared to the US system. There's also other health conditions that people have studied that kind of have this similar pattern. So yes, prices are higher, but quality is also higher in the US. Yeah, I mean, absolutely. I think that the wait times issue that you highlighted is a particular one. I want to move now, I guess, to your time under the Trump administration. So while you were under the Trump administration, it instituted a new rule that required the removal of two regulations for every new regulation promulgated. What was the reasoning behind its decision and what macroeconomic effects, if any, do you think that's brought? Yeah, so that was a huge difference between previous administration, particularly between the Obama administration and the Trump administration, was the emphasis on deregulation. So basically, how do you implement less regulation in terms of growth of new regulations is also taking away previous regulations? If you look at basically new regulations during this period, it kind of goes like this under Obama and then it just completely shuts down under Trump. We documented this. A lot of what I talk about here is in the economic report of the president between 2020-17 and 2020 when I served there. And basically, if you look at those charts, it's a remarkable historic shift in the lack of growth of regulations and taking out existing regulations. And most economists like me, economists like me, believe even though these regulations most of the time are very well intended and the people putting them in place have good intentions, many times they screw up the market and hurt the market so much. So I think a lot of a lot of growth gets missed because of these regulations in the past. And this was by far the most deregulatory president we've had in a very, very long time. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So delving into that deregulation agenda, I guess you could call it, the Trump administration sought to reduce the discretion of the various agencies, bodies, and departments of the administrative state. Why did the Trump administration seek to engage in an executive branch led rather than legislative deregulation? Well, I mean, we have, you know, in the U.S., we have the three branches, the courts, the legislature, and the executive branch. The executive branch can only control regulations. We can't control Congress, right, the Senate and the House in the U.S. They make the laws. We're in principle executing the law, the executive branch. And the question is, what can you, what's your domain of that you can actually influence the most, and it's regulatory activity? in particular for us with deregulatory activity. So all the departments under the White House were essentially instructed to be on a budget essentially. Like you said, if you increase the regulation, you had to take out other regulations to not increase the total. But the reason you do that is because that's the domain you control. We can't make the Senate or House voter. We have a lot of influence on the Senate and the House, particularly when we had majorities in the beginning, and that's how we got the tax reform implemented. But the White House can't implement tax reform itself. That's the domain of the, we don't hold the purse, the country's purse. Tax and spending is not implemented by the White House, that's Congress, House and Senate. And we had a majority in both House and Senate, and that's why we could take a lead on tax reform in 2017. But then we lost that majority, obviously, and couldn't act as directive as we did in the first year. Yeah, you already highlighted, I think, the stark contrast that the Trump presidency had to be Obama one. And in the wake of the 2008 recession, the Obama administration passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which sought to institute a series of regulations meant to provide a second coming of the subprime mortgage crisis. Under the Trump administration, Dodd-Frank was partially rolled back, with smaller banks exempted from the same ban on proprietary trading, stress testing and leverage ratio requirements as larger banks. Meanwhile, the Financial Choice Act, a proposed bill by the Trump administration that failed in the Senate, did not seek to fully repeal Dodd-Frank. So what made the Trump administration seek to modify and mitigate the act rather than seek a comprehensive repeal of Dodd-Frank? Well, I think in general you're constrained by Congress and what you're trying to do when you're trying to change an act. That's the White House, right? So you're constraining Again, guess what you can do. The underlying thesis was that a lot of regulations typically help the big guys as opposed to the small guys, in this case, in this case, banks, because there's a lot of fixed costs to be compliant with the regulation. You need lawyers, you need compliance offices, et cetera, which is a lot easier for big banks to comply with than mom and pop. We don't have really mom and pop banks, but we have smaller banks for which this regulatory burden was a lot more burdensome than for the big banks. And I think that's in general, it was a general theme in the Trump administration that we want to promote small business activity as much as we can, including in trying to reduce financial regulations that doesn't hit the small banks as much as the big ones. Yeah, so further to the issue of Dodd-Frank, in 2020, the US Supreme Court handed down the Salah Law versus CFPB decision, which allowed the president to fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the regulator established by Dodd-Frank, for any reason. Generally speaking, I think the Trump administration has sought to enhance direct presidential control and oversight over regulators and the administrative states. How do you think does policy fit in with the Trump administration's economic agenda? Well, I mean, in terms of the economic agenda, I think more this was a view of, it was an overriding view in the administration that the deal, that the deep state many times, I don't know how to put this in the right language, but what happens is that it is clear that they were not on board with certain regulations that or deregulations, I just say, that we wanted to implement. And the way I interpret this is that many times, so there's political appointees in governments, people like me that come in when the presidents win the election, and then there's what's called civil servants, people who work there regardless of president for a long period of times that are kind of executing what the White House wants. And those two with Republican presidents, there's many times a conflict between those two groups, because most civil servants are Democrats. And with Democratic, with the Democratic president, you don't hear anything about the deep state because there's no conflict between the civil servants and the political appoint appointees come in. Now why is that the civil servants are all Democrats? You don't want to be working for an institution that you don't believe in. So many, many Republicans are essentially not hanging around government for their life because they believe the government is growing too much over time. So you have this conflict which is only present when you have a Republican White House, which is not president when you have a Democratic White House. Yeah, I mean speaking of Republicans not hanging around in the same vein, the Biden administration has sought more direct control over the administrative state, most recently with the federal housing finance agency in the Supreme Court case, Collins v. Yellen, which built on the precedent of the Trump administration's efforts to enhance presidential oversight over regulators. Do you think that's been a positive change? Well, they threw out a friend of mine who was the, he was the former chief economist of the vice president, Mike Pence, who was then head of that. housing agency but again I think this these are kind of they have gone more aggressively in general the Biden administration in firing past Trump appointees and that's part of a much larger theme of the Biden administration which is they should do everything in the opposite of what Trump did essentially and no matter if it was good policy or bad policy and and I think that's kind of hurt them in some sense because they will forget where you think about Trump's Twitter and just look at the policies that he implemented. It was enormous successful economic policies until COVID hit and that we haven't seen in terms of presidents of how much economic activity or how much incomes grew of the poor population in the U.S. So if you forget anything about personalities, which is hard to do many times in politics, but if you just look at the policies themselves, what happened, I think it was a huge success economically. I don't think anyone disagrees that the US did very well economically between 17 and 2020. But then the Biden administration comes in and they basically take everything we did as something they wanted to do different, including the political appointees, which are many times appointed for longer terms than the sitting president appoint them and they try to get rid of them. I mean, I guess the biggest policy that's been looked at around the world lately, has been lockdowns. And this is both here in the UK and also in the US, they've been quite controversial. Do you think lockdowns were ever necessary? And if so, at what point did they stop being necessary? And if not, why not? So the way I come down on this is that economists kind of view diseases as taxes. Now, that sounds weird to start with. But if you think about a tax, if I put a million dollar tax on an airline ticket. No one would buy an airline tickets. No one would fly. So what's the cost of that tax? It's not the tax collected because no one is flying. No one is paying any taxes to the treasury. It's the distortion and economic activity that now everyone is taking trains and cars or whatever because they're not flying. It's the same with diseases. When a disease comes in, there's two costs of a disease. One is the disease itself, meaning death, mortality, morbidity of the disease, But what turned out for COVID, the larger cost is the cost of preventing the disease, just as preventing to fly when you have a high tax. So if you think of polio, that's like the airline example. We have such a high cost of getting polio, if you get it, that a lot of people engage in prevention. We spend all our, the whole damage of the U.S., in the U.S. of polio, is prevention, vaccination. COVID had the same feature, and we actually studied this, and I'm doing a big study for Pfizer and Moderna and the companies that launched the vaccines. If you look at what the vaccines did, essentially, it was not so much to lower mortality, and I'll get back to why. It was much more to take away the harm of excessive prevention. So the prevention for COVID was foregone economic activity. We saw a huge drop in economic activity because people were isolating, not face-to-face activities. That cost was about 80% of the total damage of COVID compared to 20% which was mortality and morbidity from COVID. And what the vaccines did was essentially to make people, you know, take away the cost of prevention. People now act freely, but you actually saw mortality go up in the U.S. with the vaccines. Why? Because people will act more freely. And it's like what we call a laffer curve for taxation. many times when you basically lower taxes, you get more tax revenue. So if I take the airline example, if I take a million dollar tax on airlines, no one applies. You have zero tax revenue. If I take a $10 tax on airline travel, I have a lot of tax revenue. I lowered the tax, I got more tax revenue. Same with vaccination. Once you got vaccinated, people had a lot fewer complications from COVID if they got infected, but therefore as a consequence, that could. activity increased because people were less scared of the disease, essentially. So but total mortality actually rose in the US with vaccines, which is kind of dramatic, because the activity rose more than the death rate conditional on infection, which is kind of interesting. Yeah, no, very, very interesting. I guess another thing that's interesting is if you look across the aisle, and so Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, for instance, has proposed new regulations for private equity firms, including restrictions and deterrence on firing employees and reducing employee pay and limitations on what private equity firms can do with newly acquired firms. Do you think Warren has a point that private equity firms are looting Main Street? And if so, how would you kind of evaluate her policy prescriptions? I don't think I agree with anything that Elizabeth Warren says. So the answer would be no. So let's take this example, for example, as the case in points. So we have private funding of private enterprises being done by, in the U.S., this is sort of a chain where you have venture capital firms if you're a startup. And then if you get a little bit bigger, you go to private equity firms, which is this, and then if you get even bigger, you go to public markets, public equity, and where you raise capital on the public markets. So I view all those as highly beneficial activity. of trying to get funding to entrepreneurs who are trying to figure out, ultimately what they're trying to figure out is how to make a bug. How do you make a bug? You basically make customers happy. So how do you make customers happy? They buy something, they value more than the price you sell it at. So if they're in that business of providing huge value to customers, I don't want any government involvement in that business whatsoever. Yeah, I mean, there's stuff like that, which I guess is very divisive. but I think there's other things which sometimes does gain bipartisan support. So recently, for instance, the Biden administration has passed a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. And I understand that the Trump administration was also supportive of some form of an infrastructure bill. And indeed, the Biden infrastructure bill did earn a few Republican votes in Congress. What do you personally think of this policy? And what are your general thoughts on the infrastructure policy of the U.S.? Well, it's very, very different infrastructure policy. that we favor than what they favor. We favored a lot of deregulatory activities. For example, if you try to build a highway in a small town in the U.S., it takes about, it can take up to 20 years to build that highway because of regulatory hurdles that you have to walk through. And same with real estate development. This was obviously very close to the President Hart. He's been dealing with real estate development his whole life. He knows how much the government screws up that process by having this lengthy and cumbersome permit process. I don't know exactly how it works in the UK, but in the US, it's a nightmare to do anything in terms of real estate. So it's a very different view as opposed to the Biden administration, which is kind of taking a climate change approach to this and trying to slow down a lot of developments, particularly in the energy sector, with the infrastructure bill of having more climate requirements. So they're adding regulations mostly where we're sweet thought to actually pull back. Yeah, I mean, I guess that speaks to the broader part of the Trump campaign, which was to represent how a part of America feels. Currently, they might be feeling disaffected, disenfranchised and structurally employed. And the Trump administration, kind of their vision was to change that. Some commentators have in fact argued that Trump has broke away from typical Republican free market orthodoxy, including support for protectionism, government spending on infrastructure, structure projects and unprecedented payouts to American individuals and families during the pandemic. Do you think Trump actually broke away from Republican orthodoxy? If so, is this a welcome change? And if not, why not? So I think the common theme or sort of a common line that gets, that we quoted in the White House was sort of like, how do we help the forgotten men and women in the US, meaning what we call the flyby states, meaning non-coastal states. So if you have a bi-coastal life and fly over the country, you pass these to Tennessee's, Oklahoma, and the Illinois or whatever. And the emphasis was, how do we help these people? And we've seen enormous destruction in some of those states from cheaper labor in other countries. And that's fine. Eventually, you have to redo what you focus on or where the labor goes more productively. But I think the protectionism was confused with a desire to obtain what we viewed as fair trade, meaning companies coming into the US are treated very nicely in terms of selling their product and services in the US market, much more nicely than companies coming into particular China, where there's forced technology transfers, meaning they have to have an ownership and stake in your company if you want to sell in their country where they're actually intellectual property theft where they actually steal your ideas and then copy them without compensating you and that kind of behavior the underlying theme of much of that kind of stuff of the tariffs were kind of how do we discipline that behavior in one way or another now tariffs has a problem because it's a lot of collateral damage with tariffs so there's a lot of market participants even outside those two countries that are affected by that by that position of a penalty. So there's different ways you can penalize countries. You see now in Russia we go in for financial sanctions, et cetera, not only trade sanctions, but the underlying motive I think was sometimes confused with that the President Trump was basically the first president to recognize that Chinese behavior was not acceptable and bring it up to surface. I think that's a bipartisan understanding in agreement at this point and that they are basically by far our biggest threat out there in terms of gaining power. Yeah, let's move, I guess, towards interest rates. So Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve Chair and now U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, was criticized for her decision to not raise interest rates fast enough as the economy recovered in the second half of the Obama administration. How do you kind of evaluate this criticism of Yellen? So I take, you know, I'm sure in this country you're very familiar with Maynard Keynes, who was a famous British economist. Now Keynesian economists think, I believe incorrectly, that the government, in terms of fiscal policy in the U.S., which is through Congress, and credit market policy, in particular price controls in credit markets by setting interest rates by the Federal Reserve, that the government can time these things well to dampen the business cycle to not make recessions so bad or not make the booms go into inflation generally that timing has been awful okay and this is kind of groundhog day again we're at this point now where we're even Keynesian economists are many times and this is not the first time this happens all the time Keynesian economists who believe in Keynesian theory of that the government can time these things well, are arguing the timing is wrong. So you see Larry Summers saying that we shouldn't be stimulating so much, it's too late in the cycle, blah, blah, blah. This happens every time where you believe this can be done because of good timing, but then the same people who say it can be done by good timing is complaining on the timing. And that's kind of an inconsistency with this policy. I don't think, I think it's like if you try to time the economy with federal policy, it's like, like trying to plan a wedding on a Sunday day, essentially, right? You can't forecast the weather that well, and with current methodologies, we cannot forecast the economy that well, and we need to kind of understand that, and it is not the first time, it's the norm that things get done in an on-timed sense, if you want to put it that way. Yeah, I mean, the economy is ever-changing. There's been argument that the sharp cuts and interest rates, at the beginning of the pandemic by various central banks gave central banks limited room to cut interest rates further as the pandemic went on. Do you think there's merit in this argument and why or why not? So what happened to interest rates were after the financial crisis, obviously they were cut dramatically. And then they were kept cut pretty much throughout Obama's term, which is something to read into that. Then they were increased during the Trump administration. administration. So you basically had, Obama had a very accommodated policy by the Fed. Trump, as you might remember, we're not very happy with the Fed because they kept raising rates on him and that's presumably slowing things down. He's particularly, he was particularly concerned because mortgage rates are the prime way in which interest rates could translate it into the demand side. And he was in real estate development so he knew how much the Fed mattered for his industry. It doesn't matter for a lot of other industries. that's not dependent on credit. Mostly cars and appliances and houses where you buy things on credit, interest rates matter, but for many other consumer goods, interest rate don't matter so much. But basically you saw this very stimulated policy under Obama. I'm coming back to not the deep state, but it's not necessarily coincidence either. And then rate hikes during President Trump, and then we saw dramatic reductions, and now we're down to zero, we were down to zero, and now we're starting to rise it again. So I think people, again, I think what we're currently doing is not really going to hit out inflation because real rates of interest, which is the nominal interest rates, let's say it's 3% or whatever, is much less than the inflation rate, which is about 8% in the US. So when, if you're paying interest and it's inflated away in the future, you're still have a very accommodated borrowing situation where you basically have cheap money right now because the real rates are so negative. Many people believe that real rates need to become positive in order to cut down easy money in an easy money environment and that we're not even close to that, no matter if you're talking about the Fed raising half a percent or a quarter of percent, etc., which is what they're talking about right now. Yeah, I mean, I guess all of this has demonstrated what in the last year's career and as a an economist you've had. What's been sort of the highlight of your career as a whole, you would say, or what's been your favorite role that you've held? Well, I think there's different parts of it. University of Chicago was probably the highlight, I think, in terms of stimulative and intellectual activity. It was very interesting. When I came there early on in the 90s, it was an incredible intellectual environment in terms of economic research. And I was kind of, my mentor was Gary Becker, who was, I don't know if you know about him in this country, but he was basically, his mentor was Milton Friedman, which I assume you heard about in this country. And so it was a very stimulative sort of time in terms of research and the quality of research that got done there. Obviously, the White House experience was fantastic. It was very interesting to kind of apply all that stuff into a more policy-direct environment. So I think those two are probably the highlight. And where do you see yourself going from here kind of as an quantum? or otherwise? Well, it depends. I'm actually, I started a company that we sold actually two years before I went into the White House, which was more of an economic consulting firm. So I'm looking right now, probably in starting another company. And actually, I was here in London talking to a bank here about that particular company this morning. So I'm hoping it goes well and you guys treat me well. Yeah, I mean, that sounds exciting. I guess you always have something up your sleeve. That brings me to any kind of audience questions. If anyone has a question, if you could just put your hands up and we'll come to you with the microphone. Yeah, I recognize a member in the white shirt. You mentioned earlier about China as a threat. I think that increasingly the Western world is coming to realize that China really is the greatest threat to Western Higemini, the Western way of life. How do you think is the best way we go about tackling this? The danger of sanctions, as seen with Russia, is potentially creating an independent second economy that we might not be able to influence. I'm wondering, what sort of policy do you think we might be able to use to stop that great evil state in the East? Well, I mean, it's a political evil in the sense that it's, you know, it's not a democracy, put it that way. And they do a lot of things to their people that we wouldn't be very comfortable with doing. So in that sense, in an economic sense, it's not so evil. And that's the problem, because they're customers of all these companies across the world in Europe, in the U.S., etc. And you don't want to anger your customer base. They're a big population. They're growing about even in a bad times like now. They're growing 5% a year, which is much higher than the US rate, about 2.5%, 3% a year. So they're, you know, in an aggregate economy sense, they're on the US level in an aggregate economy, but they're four times more people. So their per capita income is about a quarter of the US income. So they are very powerful in the sense of that, There's so many companies that have a financial interest in selling to China that it becomes very difficult to punish them. If they were not, if they were like Iran, it's a lot easier to punish Iran because we're not economically dependent on Iran like we are in China. So I think that's the problem, and that's the problem you saw with the tariffs, that many times the tariff hurt the US as well as hurting the Chinese. And that's why I mean by collateral. collateral damage. So sometimes it seems that it's better to go after. The big problem is not really the Chinese people. The big problem is the party leadership. And if you can target intervention towards the people you think is the problem, I think is the most successful way to go about it in the future. And that's kind of what we're trying to do with Russia. The oligarchs and the party, et cetera, being targeted personally, their families, their families families have been targeted personally. And there are also trade sanctions, but there's certain trade sanctions with Russia which are just too costly. Europe cannot give up Russian energy. They don't want to sit through a winner where they're cold. And so there's certain economic ties that makes it very difficult to punish countries, including, or I should say, especially China. Thanks so much for your question. We're open to further questions from the floor. I recognize a member in the black shirts. So I've got two questions. And the first one slightly related to China as well, in the how pivotal do you think the role of Taiwan, particularly given its monopoly on microchip production, how important do you think that is to the future of the US as maintaining its prominent position as an economic player? And secondly, how different do you think the economic, how differently do you think the economic sort of policies and direction of the US economy might look given if Republicans are likely to retake the Senate? Okay, they would, they're unlikely to take the Senate, they're unlikely to take the House, they're almost sure to take the House. The Senate is a little questionable, but in terms of Taiwan, so the fact The fact is I think that what's going on in Russian Ukraine are obviously a signal to other countries who want to expand, put it that way. And the fact is that we had Russian invasion of Ukraine during Obama, but not under Trump, but still under Biden. So there was something that Trump did that prevented this from happening. people were just, you know, unsure what he would do or maybe, you know, whatever he did worked. That's why I keep saying, don't look at the Twitter, don't look at the personalities, look at the results. Okay, so in the economy and foreign policy had remarkable results in terms of avoiding wars, et cetera, and stimulating the economy. Now they see obviously a different pattern and I think that's what's going to happen is that they're going to test that weakness of Biden, which is, you know, Afghanistan was a disaster with a pullout and people are now seeing that weakness. I'm not a, you know, I'm not a military expert by no means, but I think that's underlying why people are now so afraid of China coming in. In terms of gaining the House and potentially in the future of the Senate, that will be kind of an end because you need a majority in the House and then you need a majority in the Senate to pass laws but then the president can veto those laws and then it goes back and then you need a supermajority in the Senate to override the veto of the president so if we if Republicans only win the house I think it's going to be a much of a lame duck session for for Biden the last two years he cannot implement his agenda with a Republican house he has a chance now but they're not agreeing on certain things and and But I don't think Republicans are going to take, you know, a super majority of the Senate, which would be needed to completely override Biden's agenda and do whatever they wanted because they were veto proof against Biden. So I think we're going to have a, you know, from 2022 to 2024, we're going to have sort of a stalemate, which is, in my opinion, a good thing if the government does nothing because, you know, we have different political parties in the lawmaking body and in the executive branch. Yeah, thanks so much for your question. We're open to further questions from the floor. I recognize the member. Hi there, thanks for coming. So you've said a lot of things in favor of the free market and against what you call the deep state. So if you had to abolish one agency or department of the U.S. government, which one would it be and why? why. I only have to pick one. Is that what you're saying? Well, I think, you know, there's a lot of departments that do too much, put that way. I think a lot of people are abolishing or not, I would reduce the size of various departments, in particular, I think the Department of Education is a disaster in the U.S. where we have, It's not a big share of funding, but it's a big share of regulations. So only about, I think, 10% of school funding is from the federal government as opposed to local, state and local, meaning either the county or city or state that are funding the schools through property and sales tax. But that would be one. The Department of Commerce would be another one. But I mean, I am the general view that we shouldn't eliminate a lot of the departments. I just think that they many times have a lot of overreach that they should be engaged in. Yeah, absolutely. I think we have time for one more question, or maybe two more questions. We can start here. Thanks so much for coming. I am curious on a personal level. If it was frustrating for you during your time in the administration, you've mentioned several times Twitter, you don't have to ignore that. Did you feel that Trump's use of Twitter actually went a long way in masking the many amazing accomplishments that he did make? And I think also to just add a second question, I think oftentimes the Conservative Party can be less effective in their messaging of compassion, and yet often the policy that they implement do help the lowest economic sector in America. So how would you advise the Conservative Party going forward to perhaps upgrade their messaging in communicating the good that they're actually doing? Yeah, those are good questions. On the Twitter front, I think I pretty much agreed with, you know, everything he said on Twitter. The reason I brought it up because people are, people who don't like him, don't like his Twitter. I personally agree. I mean, it wasn't a lot of surprises for the economics team what he said on Twitter because we kind of knew what he was thinking. The important thing about Twitter and Trump was that typically, again, it's a difference between Republican President, and Democratic presidents, the press in the U.S. is very democratic. I mean, there's factual surveys showing that 90 or plus of them are Democrats, roughly. So you saw that with Trump. You saw enormous negative backlash from the mass mainstream media. What Twitter allowed him to do was to bypass the press and talk directly to voters. And he was the first Republican president to do that effectively. and first president to do it effectively. Now obviously if the press as a monopoly in talking to voters, they're not going to be very happy with someone who bypasses them and on top of that criticized them. But I think it was an important distinction which he used very well and it's a more valuable use for a Republican president because if you look at Joe Biden, he's nearly not as criticized at all given even though what's going on, which in my opinion is not a lot. my opinion is not a lot of good things by the mainstream media. So he doesn't need Twitter, just as he doesn't have the deep state. But a Republican president needs to communicate directly to, on his own terms, with the voters, and that what Trump did very effectively, I think, through Twitter. And people reacted to that, the people who liked him reacted to that because you talk to them like, you know, you talk to a normal person. And he wasn't kind of this high fluent politician, but he just basically talked directly to the voters. And a lot of times, they were very favorable of that kind of interaction. I guess how would you kind of improve the messaging point that? Oh, that all Republicans are evil, yeah. No, so I think, again, differentiate results versus talk, which I think is very important. Look how well the poor did. We had poverty, falling dramatically during Trump. At the same time, welfare roles were falling dramatically. So people were leaving Medicaid, people were leaving food stamps, people were leaving welfare cash programs, at the same time poverty was being reduced. That's the opposite view of how Democrats view things where we need to increase these programs to reduce poverty. And the reason obviously was that a job is the best welfare program out there, and there was a lot more job growth during Trump than it was before Trump. So I think that messaging, I think it could be improved, but it's not like we're not less compassionate. We just want the private sector to be the compassionate, if you want, rather than the government. Thank you. Thank you for your question. I'd like to look to the gentleman on the left for his question. Yes, thanks for being here. So you mentioned the difference between the regulation and deregulation between Democratic and Republican presidents. I was wondering whether that had an effect, in your opinion, about vaccine development, especially in terms of clinical trials being carried on in parallel and rapidly. You could see the difference between 10 years of clinical trials for previous vaccines and just 10 months in COVID-19. I was wondering whether that would be possible under a Democratic president, for instance, in your opinion? Thank you. Yeah, that was actually, I think that one of the biggest achievements of the Trump administration was called Operation Warp Speed. I don't know if you hear a lot about it in the UK, but it was the program that essentially try to speed off medical innovation to deal with COVID, whether it's treatment, vaccines, diagnostics. And that was essentially the, the, the The president was already warmed up to that issue, turned out by accident in some respect, but also on purpose in other respects. So he's been deregulated, actually CA, my body, the Council of Economic Advisor had been pushing a lot for food and drug administration, which is the one that proves new drugs, deregulation before COVID hits, so in 2017, 18 and 19, and through commissioner or the head of the Food and Drug in Scott Gottlieb. There's been a lot of deregulation of entry into pharmaceuticals. That brought down prices for the first time in 50 years of drugs in the US. They were actually declining as opposed to increasing first time in 50 years. So he was already warmed up on the topic of deregulating FDA. On top of it, C.A.R. Body, completely unknowingly in September of 2019, that is to say three months before COVID hit the US, wrote a report on how to speed up vaccine development during a pandemic. We had no idea what was going to be happening three months after we published that report. But again, he was warmed up to the topic. So when COVID hit, we were kind of off and running already, which was very important for Operation Warp Speed, which basically speeded up the approval at FDA, but also financed at-risk launches, at-risk production, meaning the companies produced a time of vaccines before they even knew if the vaccines were working or not so that if it became clear that they worked, they can start distributing them they want. That no company has a private incentive to do that because there's so much failure in the medical innovation process that you don't want to waste that manufacture money. So I think that's going to go down in history as a huge public health success and, you know, once we've gained more perspective on the pandemic, but I also think it's going to have a lasting effect because people now saw, look, we can do this a hell of a lot faster than we used to. It takes 10 years from idea to market for much of medical innovation. And warp speed illustrated that no, it doesn't have to, and you can have great innovation very quickly. And I think that's going to have a lasting effect. Final question for me before we have to let you go, Dr. Philipson. If you had to do the role of chairman of the President's Council of Economic, economic advisors again, what advice would you give your former self and what things would you do differently, if any? What advice would I give myself? I think the best advice is you know, you've got to communicate your opinions very clearly and very briefly. So many academics, including myself, go about and very detailed elaborations about things, etc. but if you're in the White House where there's a lot of other people in my while who are not economists who are also kind of influencing the president. And it's very important that you have the skill of communicating things very clearly and very succinctly, you know, very short sort of punchlines of what you want to get across. Otherwise, I think you get lost in the debate. And if you can't communicate simply and clearly and shortly, I think you're going to be less impactful. Yeah, absolutely. keeping things short and sweet. Thank you so, so much for your time, Dr. Philipson. It's been really an honor to learn from you and hear from you. Would everyone join me in putting your hands together for Dr. Philipson.
