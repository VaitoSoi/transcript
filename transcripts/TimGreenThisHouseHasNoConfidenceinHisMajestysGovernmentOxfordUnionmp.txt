 Mr President, thank you for this incredible opportunity to speak in such an illustrious chamber, and well done on such a magnificent term card. Congratulations also on what is the first debate of your presidency. Our president's story, coming from his school in Pakistan, where the Taliban attacked and killed his brother, to move into this country just seven years ago not speaking a word of English. To get an offer at Oxford University is a remarkable achievement in and of itself, but to ascend to the presidency of this historic union. You, Mr. President, are an inspiration to us all. And it is this story of opportunity epitomized by our president, shared by those at the top level of this conservative government. Suella Braverman, who unfortunately didn't grace us with her presence today, her parents came to this country from Kenya and Mauritius. Quasi Quarteng, the Chancellor, his parents came to this country from Ghana. And Liz Truss, the third female Prime Minister in this country, and that is 3-0, by the way. She grew up going to a comprehensive. school in Leeds. Does this sound to you like the government of the rich elite, or does it sound to you like the government of the British people? When this government came into office, our country was ravaged by an inflationary crisis. This crisis is not unique to the UK. It is one shared by those around the world. The US has seen skyrocketing inflation. The Eurozone has seen skyrocketing inflation. And what has caused this? Well, it's caused in part by the the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to significant disruption of supply chains. Parts of China are still in lockdown. But it's also caused by Russia's abhorrent invasion of Ukraine, which has caused a pan-continental energy crisis. Bills in this country are expected to skyrocket to Â£6,000 per year. I read this at the time, and I was terrified. My housemates tonight, we don't have six grand just lying about. Which is why it's great that this government stepped in and reduced energy bills to an average of two and a half thousand pounds per year. On top of this, the government has cut income tax for 31 million people, and on Tuesday, this government cut national insurance, putting an average of 330 pounds back into the pockets of 28 million working people. What does this mean? It means extra money in the pockets of the hands of the pockets of the British people. What does that mean? It means they spend money. And spending money leads to economic growth. Economic growth is what we are seeing in this country now. We have the highest growth rate in the G7. We have more than double the rate of growth as the US and of Germany. And what does economic growth mean? It means higher wages. And higher wages, ladies and gentlemen, is how we will defeat this crippling cost of living crisis once and for all. This debate, ladies and gentlemen, is a confidence debate. It is a confidence debate. It is a a parliamentary motion where if the Tories aren't in government, the Labour Party are. Sorry, Lib Dems, it's kind of irrelevant. But enough with the flocksy-knocking the hill the publication of the Lib Dems, it's important to take a look at what Labour actually has to offer. But what do they actually stand for? I'm not entirely sure. Well, luckily for us, Kiyos Dahmer, when he ran for the leadership of the Labour Party, published 10 pledges that would set out what he would do when he was in Parliament. So one pledge was to work shoulder to shoulder with trade unions. which is of course why he sacked his shadow transport secretary for attending a picket line. Let's try another. He pledged to put the Green New Deal at the heart of everything we do, which must be why he scrapped Labour's pledge to reach Net Zero by 2030. Finally, Mr. President, maybe that was chance. He pledged to support common ownership of rail, mail, energy and water, and yet in July he announced that a Labour government would not nationalise the water or the energy industries. So what is he doing? Well, the Labour MPs aren't particularly happy with this either. Richard Bergen himself had something to say about this. He said, it's not a good look to fail to honour your prejudice. And on that, I think he's absolutely right. While this government fulfills promises on Brexit, on the NHS, on 20,000 new police officers, Labor can't stick to the promises they make when they aren't even in government. You can't be a party of government if you're constantly flip-flopping on your positions. nobody knows what you stand for. What we do know is who they stood behind. At the last election, every single Labour MP stood behind Jeremy Corbyn. This is a man who recently said that we should not be supplying Ukraine with weapons. No, Ukraine should be compromising with Russia. Compromising with Russia. This is a man who MI5 monitored due to how close he is with the IRA. This is a man who invited friends to our parliament from Hamas. This is a man who every single Labour MP stood behind. This is a man who has literally been expelled from the Labour Party for his comments on anti-Semitism. Even the nice Labour MP stood behind him, even the fluffy ones, even the ones who make inspirational speeches on TikTok, even Kea Starm. Not once during Corbyn's tumultuous reign did he have the guts to condemn the fact that a female MP needed armed security at the Labour Party conference. Not once did he publicly support, the 50% of female Labour MPs who wrote to their party leader saying he wasn't doing enough to combat abuse, hate and harassment against them. If Stama won't stand up for women in the Labour Party, how in the world can we expect him to stand up for this country? So on the one side, we have a party who stood behind Jeremy Corbyn and now stand behind a man who can't keep his promises. I do not have confidence in the Labour Party. What I do have confidence in is this government. Why? Because over the past 12 years, they have delivered. This Conservative government has delivered on education with 8 million out of the 10 million children in this country now attending a good or an outstanding school, with record literacy rates, with record numbers of people attending university from disadvantaged background. This government has delivered on coronavirus. They gave this country a furlough scheme, an unprecedented and unparalleled furlough scheme with nothing like it around the world. They've delivered a record-breaking vaccine rollout quicker and faster than any other nation. in the world. This government has delivered on foreign policy with new trade deals, with Australia, New Zealand, onto the way with India, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, with world-leading support for the brave people of Ukraine, so that amongst Ukrainians, Boris Johnson has a 90% approval rating, just 3% behind Zelensky himself. It's true. It's true. This government has delivered on the economy. Every day that has passed in 2010, a thousand people have been helped into jobs. Unemployment is at its lowest rate level in than 50 years, and the economy is growing faster than the rest of the G7. This government has delivered on Brexit, enabling our record-breaking vaccine rollout, new trade deals, abolishing the EU's abominable tax on tampons, with building an immigration system that does not discriminate in favour of Europeans against people on the rest of the world, but one that is fair. This government has delivered, delivered and delivered again. The choice in this debate is simple. Do you have confidence in a government who will deliver, or do you have confidence in the Labour party who stand for nothing and will stand behind anyone. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, in Liz we must trust, and I urge you to have confidence in His Majesty's Government, thank you very much.
