 Well, Mr. President, members of this August Union, thank you so much indeed for the opportunity to speak to you tonight in opposition to the motion before the House. And can I thank Oliver for your kind words by way of introduction? After that introduction, I'm rather looking forward to hearing myself speak. But before I do, it would be, I think, remiss of me as a political leader in Scotland, not. to recognise the events of yesterday. I know the Oxford Union is powerful, but to engineer the abdication of Scotland's First Minister to bring attention to your debate is quite something. But, no, joking apart, those of us who seek a life in elected office or seek a life of public service do not get to shape the events that define our time. We have to meet them as we find them, not as we would wish them to be. And I would pay tribute to Nicholas Sturgeon that she acquitted herself in the role of First Minister with a clear sense of public duty. and determination. And while our disagreements and our discord was manifest and manifold, I do pay tribute to her for that and I wish her well with what's next. Mr. President, I want to start by saying, I love my country. I am a patriot. I stand here defending our place in the United Kingdom, but I believe in the people of Scotland. I believe that, of course, they have the right to make decisions about their future, but that decision was taken. And if Oliver had taken my point of information during his remarks, I would have reminded him that it was not Boris Johnson, that said that it was a once in a generation chance to vote for independence. It was a man sitting to his right that made such a pledge. And that is an important thing. And we'll unpack exactly why we have taken that decision. But I want to give a positive reason why liberals, why other members in the bench is opposite, you'll hear tonight why we support Scotland's retained present in the United Kingdom. In 1966, Senator Robert Kennedy was addressing a group of African students, black African students in South Africa. And he said, he said, only world-bound man still clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world is bounded by the nearest hill, that his universe ends at rivers shore, that his common humanity is enclosed in a tight circle with those who share his town or his beliefs or the color of his skin. Now, in that context, he was talking about apartheid, but he is talking about the politics of our people, identity and the politics of nationalism. And make no mistake, they are all part of a continuum. Now, while the SNP and the Yes movement in Scotland have successfully dressed their form of nationalism in the progressive clothes of the left, it is still part of a continuum on which sit people like Orban or Trump and yes, even Vladimir Putin. We have to recognize that politics is reductive, politics of nationalism is reductive. It is poisonous. And I believe that, Mr. President, we live in a terrifying world. Our world is literally on fire because of the climate emergency. We all know through the visceral clarity of recent memory that a virus or a bacteria that is passed or ingested in one community, in one country, will be readily ingested or passed on in another country around the world. These things do not recognize. recognize borders in any way. And I would also say that we will come to back to look on these times after Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and come to an understanding that we were already living in the early days of a new Cold War. The challenges that Scotland face, the challenges that these island face are manifest, they are huge, they are existential. And I know I am not alone when I believe there are no solutions to be found to those existential problems in either a border or in a flag. The concept of nation states goes back to Napoleonic times. The creation of nation states was a flawed concept to begin with. It led to 150 years of war in continental Europe. The only thing that brought about a long peace was a union and a collaboration of nations. My first speech to the Scottish Parliament took place on a particular anniversary for my family. On that day, 100 years previously, my great uncle, who was a 23-year-old private at the first Canadian mounted rifles out of Saskatchewan was killed on the first day of the Battle of Montserreal, along with 80% of his battalion. His name was Alexander Bennett, and I am named for him. A generation later, his sacrifice was met by that of two of my grandfather's four siblings, again, on European battlefields. And I think it a measure of the success of the unity of nations that I am only the second generation in the entire recorded history of my entire recorded history of my entire family to never have to contemplate war within our nearest European neighbours. It is a comfort that I would extend to my children and to theirs to come. And I am told by the SNP that I should feel that independence is somehow a lifeboat. They have spent every day since 2016 asking ardent remainers who agonise about Brexit as I and my party did, that there is some lifeboat back to European membership in the European, through independence. But I would remind them that they are latent converts to this cause. Nicholas Sturgeon herself talked about the deportation of European Union citizens should an independent Scotland not be readily granted access to European membership. They spent more on the Shetland by-election, which they lost to the Liberal Democrats, than they did on the whole of the 2016 Remain campaign. And they were very late to the table in terms of those of us who are championing the idea of a people's vote on the final terms of the Brexit deal. Their tiers are crocodile tears. They are using the votes of ardent Remainers and I tell you they can't use mine for that purpose. And there are barriers to that. It's a pleasant fiction. Because the accession criteria of Maastricht demand that member states or aspirant member states have a structural deficit of no higher than 3% or are well on the way to achieving that. Before COVID, Scotland's structural deficit stood at 9%. They wouldn't have us for years and we would have to have massive austerity and income tax hikes as a rome, just to get to the races, and we would be behind countries like Ukraine in the queue, and rightly so. We could be a decade or more outside of both unions in this terrifying world that I have just defined. My goodness, we don't need that, but it is an inconvenient truth for the SNP. And all of the S movement. And there are many, because again, I come back to that concept that Robert Kennedy reminds us that dark and poisoning superstition. We know it's poisoning because it drives community against community, others, individuals, or blames external countries or factors for the problems that are manifestly locally and domestically created. But there is a darkness to it as well. And that darkness is the opacity, that we don't know where the landing zone is, that there isn't a clear or crystallised view of what an independent Scotland is, because actually it's whatever you want it to be. I'm sorry, but in this terrifying world, we can't just look for it'll be all right on the night or we'll sort it out when we get there. Let's remember, you know, the EU want to have a defined understanding what a Scottish currency would be. The current Scottish government's policy is to dollarise by using the pound. the European Union would not allow an accession country to be using a non-member state's currency, would not allow it to not have a central bank or a lender of last resort that could help with quantity of easing. All of these are for the birds, but they are convenient answers, that the Scottish Government, the Scottish National Party and the Albert Party readily trot out as reasons to get you to believe them. Now, Scotland is not working, and we have heard very eloquently from Finley as to the manifest problems in social policy. The warning lights brinking across the dashboard. We have the worst drug deaths in the entire world. We have some of the longest waiting lists for mental health. Our long COVID sufferers, of which there are 200,000 in Scotland, would be better off moving to England for the portality of service they get in Scotland. None of these are deficiencies in our devolution settlement. They are not deficiencies of our place in the United Kingdom. They're deficiencies caused by the dead hand of ministerial disinterest in government in Holyroot, which is focused for the last 10 years and more on the prize that these people in the benches opposite me would have you vote for tonight. And Scotland is suffering because of it. We are trapped in nationalism in Scotland. We have actually been trapped in a clash of nationalisms and there are two nationalisms I would highlight in there. I'm probably in my minute but okay I'll take a point. Why do underline the world of nationalism, for the last century, nationalism has been important to because gods are not under colonial rule. Because gods are not under colonial rule. We are not subjugated. We have the vote. We have the vote. We have the choice of our own destiny. It is a voluntary union, and I think it's actually an affront to those nations who have fought for their own freedom to even compare Scotland's situation in that context. I was talking about the clash of nationalisms. There are two nationalisms that have bedeviled Scottish politics for more than 10 years. There is, of course, the Scottish nationalism of the SNP, but there's the Brexit nationalism of the UK Conservative Party. We are a people trapped between flags, between politicians who mythologise and pine for ancient nations that can never and should never exist again in the global world in which we find ourselves against those threats, those existential threats, I defined at my outset. Now, there is much to be ashamed of, of our common heritage in these islands. There are maps drawn by, British cartographers which still spark wars in old colonial countries. But for all the darkness that lies in our way, such light exists as well. In the homes for Ukraine, the NHS, the BBC, their kind of transport. You know, the British people are a good and nurturing people, internationalist of outlook. I believe in an idea of a reformed Britain. Yes, our union is imperfect. But my goodness, you do not resolve that by walking out the back door. So, friends, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, I urge you, please reject the proposition before the House tonight.
