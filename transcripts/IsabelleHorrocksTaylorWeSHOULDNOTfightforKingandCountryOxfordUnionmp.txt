 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you members, for having me to speak tonight. It is a true privilege to officially open this debate for the side proposition, so historic as it is, after 90 years since this society last voted against fighting for king and country. Now, before I start, I'm going to be very honest with you all, up until an ungodly hour last night, I spent all week preparing a speech for the wrong side of this debate. It turns out that despite getting into Oxford to do a humanities degree, I still can't read properly. But at least it means that before I have even begun to state my case, we are all miraculously within one mind. None of us know what I'm going to say. There is a very important difference between tonight's motion and the one that was debated 90 years ago. In this, In 1933, the society voted that under no circumstance would they fight for king and for country, only to be sucked into the Second World War less than a decade later. To fight under no circumstance is an incredibly sweeping declaration, and one that clearly has not stood the test of time. To declare to fight under no circumstance would be like declaring after a particularly boozy night out, for example, and far too much liver abuse later, to under no circumstance ever drink again. a matter of principle, perhaps, or of caution, a matter of wanting to represent sensible and rational qualities, only for the very next night to be violently attacked by the glorious prospect of a Â£3.50, vali or blue. If Putin were to land at Dover next week, then there presents itself a circumstance in which I would fight to defend my home and my right to spend too much money in baili or bar. So this evening, thankfully, the motion does not demand that we would never fight for king and country. So know that tonight members, if you do vote for side proposition, you would still be left with that choice, the choice of going to war or defending this country under extenuating circumstances. Therefore, my two main points tonight will be as follows. Firstly, why we would not and should not have confidence in our king and country. And secondly, why there are other things, far more hopeful things, that we should fight for and wish to protect. However, before I begin to delve too deeply, it falls to me to introduce the side opposition. When I first found out that I was going to be giving this speech, looking for advice, I was told the most important part of my address tonight would be the roasts, after which most people would generally stop listening anyway, albeit for me to believe this was a distinguished debating society that took itself seriously. It is a true privilege to be speaking tonight alongside our very own president, Mr. Charlie McIntosh of New College. I don't think many people in this room will be all too surprised that Charlie is representing the opposition tonight, whether it's because he has marshaled the Union Committee so far this time with all the dedication and direction of an Army General, or whether it's because I'm told he used to hang a poster of the Queen above his headboard. We all have our reasons. One of my earliest memories actually of Charlie was our very first committee meeting. And he asked all of us to go around and introduce ourselves, you know, names, colleges, positions. A fun fact. Some people talk to their obsession with sea monkeys, others of how much money they had stupidly wasted on Christmas market poncho purchases, you know, everyday stuff. But finally, when it got round to me, I decided to announce that I'd recently lost half a toe whilst walking on pilgrimage in Italy. I'm not like other girls. Charlie seemed very interested in this. He was like, really? Wow, we're going to have to see some pictures of that. To which he was immediately called out. Charlie, you want to see feet picks. I think it's safe to say in that moment I became aware that my time on committee may be a little more lively than I had previously anticipated. But while I may not have been at this university for very long, from what I've observed, Charlie's unwavering dedication to this society does him utter justice, and I really do look forward to hearing him speak tonight. Speaking next is the Right Honourable Tobias Elwood, former captain of the Green Jackets, MP of Bournemouth East, and chair of the Defence Select Committee. It is my sincere hope that Mr. Elwood has enjoyed this evening's proceedings so far, the tour, the debate dinner, the photo, and I indeed expect that he has, since it is now so widely known just how much he values his dinner parties. But of course, we are supposed to gloss over the Christmas dinner Mr. Elwood attended during lockdown restrictions with 26 other people. Nonetheless, it is a true pleasure to have. have you tonight as someone who's experienced and achieved such a distinguished career in both politics and the military. And finally, we have Sir Richard Cherath, an alumnus of Exeter College and a retired senior British Army officer who served as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe between 2011 and 2014. It was a true delight to discover early today that Sir Richard and I actually attended the same school, Aundall, and now I of course attend his Alma Mater University as well. I fear maybe the similarities stop there, however. For you see, sadly, Sir Richard took up modern history during his time at Oxford. This pain me as an ancient historian to find out. However, maybe I can take some consolation and the fact that Sir Richard was already in the early stages of his career before they even allowed girls like me into Aundle. So as a result, perhaps I shall find myself studying a time period Sir Richard has in fact lived through during the course of my classics degree. But all jokes aside, I'm thoroughly looking forward to Sir Rich's take on this motion. Mr. President, these are your speakers and they are most welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a country that has a king. That is a fact. It is a fact I'm sure many in people in this room perhaps desire to change. But while that is a different debate entirely, it still does fall to us to understand, however, that if war broke out tomorrow, what exactly we would be expected to fight for? The king, a figurehead of a tired institution, held up by a family full of seriously questionable characters, out of touch, disloyal, and in one case, unforgivably sickening. Is this what we should feel comfortable representing? And do these people even deserve our sympathy that they must have, complete the hard task of living their lives in the tabloids, though they sit upon a fountain of wealth, while millions of key workers, the real warriors of our society, fight for the right to be appropriately paid. This leads me on to the country. We're here to begin. Today's politicians are largely of a certain breed, and in the words of Ian Hunter, they're successful in taking up their seats simply because they are willing to tow a party line, and yet in reality many possess an inability to think for themselves, speak for themselves, eat by themselves, and we would struggle to find one among them who could tell you what a woman is. What a dire situation we find ourselves in, with a fading royal family and a failing government, and we face a crisis of confidence in the very banner we would be expected to rally behind. Julian Mitchell discusses this very concept in his wonderful play, Another Country, set at a typical boys' boarding school around the time the society decided to vote against Kingdom Country in 1933. There are many things that represent another country in this play. The Soviet Union being one, the world of the prefect God, another, and perhaps most importantly, a place of real acceptance that the protagonist, Bennett and Judd, both desperately dream of. Unfortunately, the play suffers a bleak conclusion, where Bennett, who is gay, and Judd Marxist, realize that they must deny who they are or abandon their principles in order to protect themselves and those around them. In some ways, we stand here today in Bennett and Judd's vision of another country, in a place where people are accepted for who they are, for their sexual and gender identities, for their political views, but there is still such a long way to go. There are many wars to be fought, but these are not found overseas in conflicts that are truly none of our business. These are structured. These are not the struggles of our time. The wars that we will choose to fight take place on our home soil. Once we properly realize the irrelevance of the monarchy and that the country we live in will soon be half its size due to climate change, then maybe we can start fighting these battles. These are the wars that will make a difference in our lives, that will shape our future and protect us in the long run. So you ask me why I would not fight for king and for country. It's because I choose to fight for myself, for my future, for my future, and most importantly for my family. The day I fight for king and country is the day I am just as proud of my king and country as I am of them. The play takes its title, another country, from the second verse of the popular hymn I vow to thee my country, a hymn which has often been criticized for its heretical and nationalist overtones. Now, I won't serenade you because I highly doubt my voice would do much to the persuasiveness of my case, but let me remind you of the words, nonetheless. And there's another country that I heard of long ago. Most dear to them that love her, most great to them that know. We may not count her armies. We may not see her king. Her fortress is a faithful heart. Her pride is suffering. And soul by soul and silently her shining bounds increase and her ways are ways of gentleness and all her paths apiece. Cecil Spring Rice, when writing these words, saw the kingdom of heaven as another country. But this heaven, as Bennett and Judd prove, can mean something entirely different. Another country is a vision of what is to come, the test of our faith and the promise of paradise. So diverse is its meaning that on request it was played at both Winston Churchill and Princess Diana's respective funerals. Both of them dreamed of another country, but how different would those countries be? Churchill being the fervent supporter of the very same system that swallowed Diana whole only to spit her back. back out again. So what have we, ladies and gentlemen? Do we aspire to move for change? Do we aspire to cast a thick veil over the caricature of our government and Prince Harry's Freudian obsession with his toger? We aspire, like Bennett and Judd, to be ourselves, and we aspire to fight what would believe in, and what will make the greatest difference. For King and for country is a meaningless banner, a phrase coined during the dark days of 1915, to encourage young men to sign up to their deaths for a bitter war concerning a bitter alliance. We must do better. So fight with me for another country and fight for the proposition so all our paths can be peace. Thank you.
