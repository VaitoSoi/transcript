 I mean, good evening. I'll just like to open by saying if anyone is finding gender-neutral's bathrooms, quite confusing. There's no hope for you. I will continue. My name is Rico Jacob Chase. My pronouns are he, him. I'm a director at Transaction UK-CIC and a trustee and treasurer at LGBT Consortium. As was mentioned earlier, I recently was semifinals in a TV show, Mait Me, Prime Minister. and before you ask no, I didn't want to be Prime Minister. They changed the name after I applied, and now I have this obnoxious headline on my CV. But to begin the proposition, or to continue rather, I would say that the future is post-gender. I probably should first suggest the obvious. I'm a trans man who's taking it upon himself to move to the other end of the gender binary, and it might seem a bit hypocritical to profess that gender does not exist. I will however point out that living in today's, society of high gender polarization, it's significantly easier for trans and non-binary people to go about their day-to-day lives whilst they have socially and or medically transitioned. Trans people account for 1% of the UK population and around about three quarters of our community socially transitioned and only half of us medically transition. But the main reason for this is actually societal pressures. because once embarking on our journey of self-discovery, it's easier to walk through life as our true selves. But as a trans man who lives a proportion of my life as both genders, I'd like to offer you some interesting insight. I can safely confirm that there is a note of difference between the genders, but as we are talking about the future, let us turn our attention there. So what do we mean by the abolition of gender? Post-genderism is not concerned, solely with the physical sex and its assumed traits, it's focused on the ideal for eliminating or moving beyond gender identities. This does sound tadlamist, but I would argue that it's actually achievable in the not-so-distance future. Firstly, there is a definitive difference between the existence of gender and it playing a divisive role in society. We are not discussing raising gender, but redefining its role in our identity. day-to-day lives. The moon may indeed exist on all of us equally, but most of us bear its little mind, unless, of course, you're a sailor, which probably have something more important. But now back to being serious, I argue that it is natural progression, and possibly even inevitable, that gender will become increasingly less relevant in future societies. As the feminist movement, the men's mental health movement and the trans rights movement strive for equality. In short, on the long road of trans activism, there eventually will be a natural close. To take the analogy further, all equality laws have been passed. When hate crime is measurable, trans people are a respected member of society. In theory, there will be anything else to fight about, and ego it no longer will be topical. I guess the most obvious critique of my last comment would be that gender equality can still exist, but genders can still play a significant role in society. In short, segregation of genders, but all are treated equally. An excellent example would be single-sex spaces, which either can be dictated by social conventions or actively enforced. For example, gender segregation is enforced in some religious gathering schools, and toilets. Whereas, society dictates norms from some careers to domestic household and some sports. Therefore, I conclude, it is inevitable that inequality will naturally creep into segregation exists. Another extreme example, separate but equal, for me, echoes the racist segregation passed in the US Supreme Court in in 1896. With that in mind, even with the best intentions, segregation inevitably leads to inequality. So gender roles, what are we talking about here? If we were to argue that gender roles developed from naturally comparative advantage, such as the hunter-gathering society, it also would be logical to suggest that as this comparative advantage were to become increasingly more redundant, X technology evolves. Therefore, so should gender roles. There aren't many bison's despair on my morning commute home. So I would therefore argue that it is natural to devise. So therefore, I argue it is natural for this divide to become increasingly inessential and the future considered null. However, this example is heavily based on the assumption that all societies originate with a role-based division, which is actually not the case. The Sand tribe in South Africa that spanned territories of now Nambia, Angola, Letho, Boswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe are the oldest cultures on Earth. DNA tests prove that they are the direct descendants of the first homo sapiens. Most interestingly, they don't actually have an official leader. And even more interestingly, they take decisions in the group where male and females are considered equal. It could be possible to say that in our pursuit of a perfect society, we may have assumed, in fact, that we are progressive. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but in countless examples where our ancestors have structured communities that are significantly more progressive, acceptable and inclusive than the one we live in today. Now colonialism, everyone's favourite topic. Colonialism increases the lasting impact on the society that we know today. Over half of the users of Gallup and LGBT hotline actually happened to be POC, and over half of the use of Stonewall housing, homeless shelter, also happened to POC. So how do colonialism has a lasting impact on today? Well, it's actually relatively simple. If you have a colonialist group that project an idea of a perfect society on other groups, and it's sustained for several hundreds of years, the lasting impact is that those beliefs remain. So, as a result, people in India are actually removing laws that were put in during a colonialist era, and there's a lasting impact of homophobia, and therefore transphobia and PEOC communities today, hence the disproportionate impact on our communities in this country. Now we have discussed inclusive past areas of colonialism. Let's discuss countries of progressive sciences on gender equality. Various countries have fought against abolition rights. They fought for women's rights, equal pay and equalities, as my colleagues have tested to earlier. And I'll be a bit cheeky here. Scotland has also moved towards introducing misogyny as a hate crime, and I will mention Scotland is doing a lot in the progression of gender rights. I would like to expand on the topic of masculinity as this stereotypical, as it is these stereotypical attitudes that are these stereotypical sets of attitudes and ways of behaving that have negative impact on men in society as a whole. In the UK, the Office of National Statistics reported that 70s, 74% of suicide were male in 2013. Some of the main concerns noted were inevitably to support their families, which is expected in the traditional household, where the male is the sole provider. The ONF noted that middle-aged men were more likely to be affected by economic adversity, alcoholism and isolation, but also less likely to seek help. This tougher-than-Nell's attitude fees into peer pressure subjected to men at a young age, such as, Boys Don't Cry. It embeds toxic masculinity into society. I would therefore argue that an approach gender society, it would not only benefit women, non-binary people, trans men. It would also benefit cis-hept men. No, thank you. Now to address the second point of hypocrisy. I stand here in the social construct of masculine attire and I think it would be a good time to address the difference between gender identity and gender expression. Gender expression is a person's mannerisms and appearance. But as we know, RuPaul is a gay man even though they do present as a woman. So therefore, I think it's important to recognise that in the overall brief. I would therefore like to discuss what I believe to be the realistic timescale for post-genderism. As we discussed, feminist movement is striding for gender equality, the men's mental health movement is fighting against toxic masculinity, and trans-wide movements is campaigning for legal equality. In my mind, we all collectively addressing the legacy styles of colonialism and patriarchy, and moving towards a more equitable society. If you like, returning to the ancient wisdoms of our pre-colonious societies. So when is the post-gender future? I would argue that this post-gender future is both attainable and more importantly, achievable within our lifetimes. The motion states that gender-neutral society is an ultimate goal of feminism, but I would argue it is natural progression of society. Men should be able to cry. Women should be paid equally. Non-binary people do indeed exist. And within our lie times, I propose discussions around gender will become redundant. Why? Because we finally would be deemed equal. Thank you.
