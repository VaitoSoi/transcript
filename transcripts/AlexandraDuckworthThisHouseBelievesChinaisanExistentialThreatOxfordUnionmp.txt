 It is a lot bigger standing here than it is sitting down there. Anyway, I could not possibly begin this speech without congratulating the president on his fantastic term with engaging speakers, panels, not to mention alleged conspiracy with foreign agents. I must also thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate. it's a topic of immense importance to me, both as a student of politics and as someone with a Chinese descent with a decidedly Western way of life as the librarian has made very clear to you now. For the 12th time tonight, what is this way of life? I think the most relevant facets for the purpose of this debate are those that the CCP is actively seeking to stamp out in their own country. It primarily boils down to two things. Firstly, the freedom of speech and secondly, the freedom of choice, whether that be in your religion or the media you consume or the government that rules over you. More concisely, it is the values of a liberal democracy. Now, let me be clear. I do not have to defend this way of life as even the best way of life, nor the most moral way of life, not even the most efficient way of life. I just have to convince you that China is mounting a serious challenge and pushes alternatives that undermine these values on a global scale. Yesterday, Sir John May just stood in this chamber and warned us about the ever-increasing alienation between the US and China, which is tearing apart the international community and writing a new chapter in the textbook of international relations. As tensions increase, this is indicative of irreconcilable differences between the Americans and, you know, the more broadly speaking, Western way of life, and the CCP's political and social values. When facing this motion, I was initially quite daunted by the rather extreme burden I had to prove today, that these irreconcilable differences are existential, that is, they are never ending and they're growing at an ever-increasing rate. But consider that we share the same way of life with the current global superpower, the United States. Perhaps it means we're doing something right. But if China is joining its ranks as a superpower by 2050, as predicted, I myself read this in a fortune cookie, then we should be afraid. because it tells us, and it tells everyone, and it tells every single country that is still growing and still developing, that you do not need to be a democracy to be powerful, you do not need to be a democracy to be rich, and perhaps if you got rid of your democracy, you can grow just as quickly and efficiently as China has done. This new proposed model of development should scare you, because it threatens all the things that we take for granted living in a liberal democracy. There are over three dozen countries in sub-Saharan Africa participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, which is characterised by China's no-strings-attached approach to investment and aid. While support from the West comes with the conditions of democratic and economic reforms, China is able to distinguish itself as a trading partner that respects the sovereignty of the countries it trades with. But this only means it pursues a policy of non-interference with African authoritarian regimes. China is largely agnostic to the kind of regimes it wants to trade with, but this means it is responsible for sending money flows and supporting the stability of more unsavory regimes, further entrenching any authoritarian leadership that already exists and hindering the protection of human rights in Africa, which further hinders the development of Africa itself. Now, Spencer, I don't mean to knife you, but I do. Please note that China does not actively have to export its own brand of authoritarianism for it to support authoritarianism more generally, especially in the developing world. But make no mistake, China's threat is not only ideological, and I don't think we need to wait until China's ascension in 2050 to be scared. One does not have to be particularly or unreasonably or overly sympathetic to the West to realise China is preparing as if it's about to mount a physical military threat and surely at least intends to us up the US as a dominant military power, at least in the region. defense spending is clearly a priority. Last weekend, the CCP announced that despite its lower than expected economic growth at about 5%, it will still be growing its defence budget by 7.2. This equates to about $224 billion. The opposition will tell you that this is nothing compared to the $800 billion the US spends on its defence, but to that I say, I don't recall when we decided to start believing the statistics that come out of the CCP. In practice, we should consider the defence budget to be significantly heftier than the $224 billion reported, because the government has the prerogative to appropriate any private innovation for military purposes. This includes satellites, this includes artificial intelligence, and, oh, I don't know, high altitude spy, oh, no, sorry, meteorology, balloons. The appropriation of private enterprise also includes the potential for China to seize fishing. boats to complement its navy, which is now actually the largest navy in the world. Again, the opposition will tell you that a fishing boat is not a significant threat. But consider that these fishing boats essentially establish a de facto presence for China as an operating presence in the gray areas of the South China Sea. In addition, consider that the military bases China has now built in that sea started off as these innocent small fishing trawlers. It is clear that Beijing can effectively deploy every element of national power towards its defense in what the Pentagon calls a military civil fusion. That's obviously not to say that their defense budget is immediately equivalent to their $18 trillion GDP, but we should not let the $224 billion figure lure us into a false sense of security. China is clearly working towards producing a military force that could dislodge the US as an agent in the region. But if you're still unconvinced and you're still thinking the West is overreacting to a country that's merely defending its territory, then I want you to look at how China's neighbours are responding. The Taiwanese president simultaneously reiterated the importance of diplomacy with Beijing and pledged to boost the island's defence, including precision missiles. Then look at Japan. Japan is powerfully aware that a Taiwan-China conflict will likely drag them into. This could explain Japan's recent pledge to dramatically increase its defense spending over the next five years, so that it will ultimately have the third largest defence budget in the world. This is the same country whose 1947 constitution declares that the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation, and that land, sea and air forces will never be maintained. Ladies and gentlemen, you must see how China is pushing Japan to its limits in terms of its own national. security. Perhaps you might think the threat is a bit alien, but the ramifications are far reaching and will inevitably impact your own way of life. We would expect the world economy to crumble, given Taiwan's dominant position in modern technological manufacturing, with its semiconductors being used in everything from fighter jets to your smartphones. The CCP's megalomaniac belligerence is not a problem we can sideline, because even if you don't care how Beijing is affecting other ways of life. Well, I mean, I think you should, but even if you don't, it will inevitably proliferate to and attract from your own way of life. Because if you vote against this motion, you are voting against fortifying democracy in every developing country that China has an economic foothold in today. And if you vote against this motion, you are saying that the likes of Japan and Vietnam and Taiwan and Hong Kong are just paranoid and that you do not believe in the possibility of a conflict that will totally destabilize the region and will decimate. the global economy. To finish, I have no Chinese proverb to say to you in Mandarin, but I did study history. So, Nebole of Bonaparte is often attributed with the quote, China is a sleeping giant, let her sleep for when she wakes, she will shake the world. They say the same thing about me, actually. 200 years later, she has merely begun to stir, but you should all be trembling. Thank you so much. I'm
