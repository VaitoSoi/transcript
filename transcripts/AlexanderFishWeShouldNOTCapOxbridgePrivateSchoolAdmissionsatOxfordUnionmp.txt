 Thank you. Looking to bring it home. As our history student, chair of our consultative committee, Alex Winthrop Fish, Hartford College. Thank you, Mr. President, for affording me the privilege to once again speak in this historic chamber. I would also like to thank you for all the brilliant work you've done to deliver the term card, which has got some knockout people like AJ. But also, I look forward to your reign as SU President and indeed the many other societies that you want to be president of. Many people, including myself, have been surprised to see me on this side of the motion. As a self-professed communist, my little Marxist heart was completely broken when I was told I had to be on opposition. But in the spirit of debating, and more importantly, in the spirit of shoeing the tabs, I'm going to give it my best shot. I'm afraid I must also start with a very filthy confession. I, like many of the leftists in this place, was privately educated. But I'm also keen to confess, And I am well aware that without my private school education, I would not be stood in this chamber today. Private schools afford people a privilege that runs deeper than any statistical dominance that has been discussed today. It is something that we've all touched on, and it's something I want to hone in on in particular in my speech. I'm going to focus on three main points. Firstly, I want to re-courise the background and context of this debate, which I think has been sorely missed. Secondly, I want to give a much more particular analysis of where private school privilege comes from and the deep roots that it has. And thirdly, I want to walk you through a world in which this motion comes into effect. To understand why we're having this debate, we need to understand the state of state school education at its current time in Britain. We have the worst levels of funding since the 1980s. we spend less per head in real terms in the 21st century than ever before. And as the former principal of my college, Hartford College, Will Hutton, pointed out, we have not even recovered from the austerity measures that David Cameron put in in 2010. Schools have been left of obscenely high teacher-to-student ratios. Head teachers are complaining about having to make decisions based on economics and not on educational choices. after a decade of Tory rule, we can see that the state education system is in tatters. But I'm not going to argue today that because of that, we need to reaffirm our faith in private schools, that private schools are offering a better and alternative education, because we know that not to be the case as well. The truth is that despite the advantages of private education, which seem apparent to everyone in this debate, there is no evidence to suggest that kids in state schools are brighter or smarter or going to succeed in the tests that get them into Oxford in the first place. Take the TSA, for example. Between 2013 and 2017, a TSA score for a state school pupil was 61. For privately educated pupils, it was 61.9. Now, as a historian, I know little to nothing about the TSA and PPE, but I've been told by the president, who is a PPEE, himself, that this is in fact a minuscule difference. As a side note, the President was very, very keen to point out that he got in the top 5% in the country when he did the TSA. You can give it a clap. I mean, that's worth it. So despite the apparent equality in the results that we're getting in TSA scores and other measures of education, why is Oxford accepting more privately educated people than state-educated? Well, this brings me on to my second point, which is a particular analysis as a to where this privilege comes from. Private schools are able to instill in pupils a certain amount of confidence and, dare I say, ambition, that comes along with the soft skills that we've been touching on this evening. Now, where does this confidence come from? I think it comes from several things. One of them being the extracurricular activities which private schools offer. It has become the new USP of many private schools in this country. Take a school just north of me in Scotland, a place called Gordonston. They have gone so far in this armed, race over private school extracurricular activities that they have their own fire brigade. You know, either that is a step too far, or it's a really clever fire insurance policy where they're using child labour. But also, I think what we have here is private schools that are investing in less bonkers ideas as well. The reason why I like debating is because I went to a private school. I was afforded the privilege of being able to debate. but they also teach you the soft skills that come along with that. Think about the networking opportunities, as I've been told by many people in this place. Think about how you learn to work a room and the charm and charisma that is brought with that. Now, what you have then is all these people from private educated backgrounds coming to this university. This is a university that is primed and preps in a uniquely private school manner. think about the way that privately educated people have been educated their whole lives a lot more one-on-one teaching a lot more formal dinners and people who are told from a very young age that they are entitled to the kind of confidence that display in this place. This goes to show why we've talked about this evening the people that haven't come to apply for Oxford or Cambridge because they don't think that they're worthy of doing that. That is something that is not really an issue amongst many private school pupils. But I hesitate to say that this is just something that stops at Oxbridge, because it is in fact something that the nation as a whole values. We have fallen in love with the charming, posh politician. We have fallen in love with the tofs that run this country. When Will Hutton talks about this almost gibbon-esque idea of civilization declining, it's a civilization of decline that we have voted for, a civilization of decline that we fully back. But think about the people, who don't demonstrate the kind of private school mannerisms, which I may be demonstrating right now. Think about Angela Rainer, someone of a thick northern accent, which delineates in many minds, a working-class accent. Think about how she is treated in the press. But also, look at the science behind this. Look at the studies that show that voters already make up their minds, not on the issues of policy, but on the issues of how someone holds them. themselves and how someone speaks. I'll take myself as an example. Believe it or not, I am from Scotland despite this accent, but this accent wasn't here before. I got it after I came down. Our society values the ambitious private school stereotype. So I ask you then, as I move on to my third point, to consider what this motion looks like in practice. We have a faculty, we have universities that value those kinds of. kind of attributes in a person. Attributes that are dominated by private school people. And the people who control our society, as we've heard up and down the debate tonight, are privately educated themselves. So what do these institutions of power want to do? Well, they want to take the people that come into them and instill them with those values as well. What we have then, our institution of powers, possibly much like this place, that want to take people and mould them in to the private school stereotype that our nation values so much at the moment. In short, this motion is eerily reminiscent of recent rules changes that have been brought to standing committee, sound and principle, good in heart, but impractical and harmful at best. The way we solve the issue of private schools in this country is for a combined effort of many policies. But we have to aim at changing our current culture and our current values. set. We can't have a society that then takes this cap and says we fixed all the issues and then proceeds to mould people to look and sound like the private school clique and privilege that we had before. This looks like radically reforming Oxbridge. It looks like accepting that state school people have different attributes and have different ideas that they can bring to the table that haven't been considered before and different life experiences that they can bring into our society. Currently, the process is stacked against that, but we can make that change without simply slapping a cap on it. When we see inequality, we are always keen to jump in and take rash action. When dealing with a society that seems obstinate, when dealing with a society that seems prone to elitism. You don't slap a reboot button on it without dealing with the undercurrents that lay beneath it. You don't burn the house down about thinking about where those foundations came from. And as for all those reasons, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to vote side opposition tonight. I'm
