 So welcome to Oxford. Thank you. Thank you. I suppose I thought we'd start off by talking about River Cafe and your journey to it. So you originally set it up as a cafe at the side of your husband's architecture office. Can you talk us through where the idea came from to start the cafe and how it grew into the phenomenon it is today? Yes, of course. First of all, I'd like to thank you for inviting me. And we've had a wonderful hour visiting the union, seeing the history, the photographs, the people who've been here. So it's a huge honor for me to be here. So thank you very much. And I would say that it's been quite a trajectory from opening a very small little cafe in Hammersmith, in 1987, so we had our 35th birthday in September. And I was always a passionate cook. I had a lot of children, and we lived in Paris. And so I think the whole importance, my husband is Italian, his mother was a great cook. And so I've always had a career as a graphic designer. I worked in publishing. I worked in magazines. I worked in the architect's office of the Pompidou Center, which my husband was the architect for. And so food was a major part of our life. And so was community. And we, having lived in Paris for six years building the Pompadou, we came back to London. It was a very strong commitment that we wanted to have an office that was not just an office in a building in the center of London, but to kind of find a place where there could be a sense of community. And we found these warehouses on the Thames in Hammersmith, and one of Richard's partners was biking around looking. And they were called the Duckham's warehouses, where they made oil. They basically tinned oil. And they were for sale, and he and his partners bought them, and immediately tore down one of the warehouses, made a green space in the middle where people could just meet and communicate. and the only thing missing was a place for people to eat because there were various designers and architects and graphic designers there. And so there was a small little space and I was working as a designer in the office and they sent out, you know, applications. Applications came in for people to take the space and we were on a ski trip and I said, you know, the only thing worse was one of those comments you make when you don't know what you're saying. And then not having a place to eat would be to have a mediocre place. And all these applications are mediocre, and I think I'll do it. And that was it, you know. And so it was one of those rare times in life where you actually make a decision. And then I knew Rose Gray very well, and she had come back from the United States, having worked in a restaurant helping set up a club called Nells. And so I called her up and I said, let's go look at this site. And we did. I had no experience. She had very minimal experience. And we started very, very small with, you know, they designed a restaurant that cost us 30,000 pounds. And we bought, you know, furniture from the reject shop. We've had secondhand grills and friars and friars and fridges from a place up north. And just, you know, we, I made sandwiches and Rose would make a pasta, or I would make a pasta and she would make sandwiches. And that was the very, very beginning of the River Cafe. What was the process like then from that first opening to designing your first permanent menu or seasonal menu and sort of turning it from being a cafe, which your original license, I believe, was only for lunchtime hours to a full-time restaurant? Well, I always think restrictions kind of breed creativity, you know, that if you had restrictions, and we did, as you say, we were only allowed to open at lunchtime. were only allowed to open to the people who worked in the community. And so they were very unreceptive to having a restaurant what they thought was a residential area. So it was a godsend, actually, for two women who really didn't know what they were doing. And so having these restrictions meant that we grew very, very, very slowly. And we learned as we grew. But we always, the fundamental aims of the River Cafe, I'd say, were, you know, to have a place where you had an open kitchen, like we did at home, to have ingredients that had integrity like we shopped for, to have people who worked for us, who were treated with respect and care and concern, and as we did in our homes with our children. And so I think the values that we had that set up the restaurant probably is still there 35 years later. What has changed, of course, is a knowledge of Italian food, of the kind of food that we knew always in the very first day that we wanted to cook, the kind of food that we ate and cooked in Italy. My husband comes from an Italian family, and Rose lived in Tuscany for three years. So we knew that was the food we wanted to cook. and we knew that we wanted to change the menu for every meal. And so that's something we still do today. So whether we were cooking then for sort of 25 covers at lunchtime or last night we did 180, that a chef comes in and writes a menu every day for every meal. And so what you said you knew when you launched it and it developed that you wanted it to be an Italian-themed restaurant. How did you and your partner train yourselves in Italian cooking? Well, we'd already been cooking Italian food. So I learned, both of us actually learned from Richard's mother, who was a woman from Trieste, so she was from northern Italy and then moved to Florence, and was forced to learn to cook because they came here during the war. And so I think she really had a, I think really from our, our kids, her knowledge was really based in Italian cook, cooks teaching us how to cook, home cooking. Though we read from cover to cover to Marcella Hazan, wrote the art of Italian cooking, Elizabeth David. So we read, we cooked, we learned, we had experienced ourselves, and as I said, we were small. And then the real thing that happened was we went to Italy all the time, even when we were very small. and we learned, we met producers of wine. And again, that deepened our knowledge of Italian cooking. Italian cooking is very regional. You know, it really is not only regional from Tuscan or Piermonte or La Marque or Pierre Monte. It's, I would say, it's region to region, it's city to city, it's town to town, village to village, and family to family. So it's a very fiercely proud way of cooking. As the restaurant started to grow and gain fame and status, was there a moment when you sort of thought, oh, okay, wow, this has really taken off? I think we were so busy trying to get through the day that there might not have been that eureka moment, but there certainly was a sense. I think probably one of the big turning points was when we, managed to get another space next to where we were and we were able to expand and have a proper kitchen and a proper reception area and really and a cold store, all those things we didn't have. But I think for us, the big moment was when we wrote our first cookbook. And that was a sense that, wow, people want to read our book and buy our book and know us as not only a small restaurant in Hammersmith, but a book that had recipes from ourselves. And I remember growing up with the River Cafe Cookbook on the side at home, making stuff for it with my parents. When did you decide you wanted to make a cookbook? And how do you choose which recipes go into that? Well, our first book, we opened the River Cafe in 1987 and our first cookbook came out in 1994. And in those sort of seven years, we, you know, when we were cooking, We were asked to do a book sooner than that. We said no because we said we were chefs, not writers. And so we really wanted to concentrate on being chefs. But I think what we realized was that we needed to write the recipe down for the chefs that were working for us. It was really a way of communicating to the people because we were cooking recipes, and then somebody would come and work for us and we'd have to kind of tell them what to do. So we realized that it was a form of communication, not only for the outside world, but for ourselves. Do you have a favorite recipe from that cookbook? Oh, that's hard. From the very first blue cookbook, I think one of the brave recipes that we did was for a soup called Papa a Pomodoro, which really has four ingredients. It has tomatoes, it has bread, it has garlic and has basil, a bit of olive oil and water. But I think, you know, I remember serving one day in the river cafe and a customer getting very crossed. He had to pay something like three pounds, 50 for what he called bread and water, you know, and tomatoes. But it's one of my favorite soups and now it's everywhere. So from being founded in 1987, just you and your partner running the cafe, to the cookbook coming out, when did you first start to take on staff? And was that a strange process when you started to think, okay, we're now seeding some control of our kitchen? Yeah. Because in the beginning, beginning, it was Rose and myself and really one other person. And then we, our first, the first person we hired was someone called Sam Clark, who was actually a chef and went on to do really great restaurants, Morrow, a Spanish restaurant. And it was very, very exciting to think that we actually had a chef working with us. And then, you know the writer Hugh Fernley Whittingstall, who also, went to Oxford and came to, he always wanted to be a chef and he came to work for us. And I always say that I made his career by firing him because he then went on to great things. And he was a great chef and he was a great person, but it just we were too small. We couldn't afford to have too many chefs because we were so tiny. But he worked for us for years. And then we had, then it just started, as it started growing, as we were allowed, first we were only allowed to be open at lunchtime, Then we were allowed to be lunchtime to the public. Then we were allowed to be open to dinner, but only Monday to Friday. We had to close at 10 o'clock at night. So it was a very slow process. And so with that, we grew with the restaurant. One of the things you are most famous for is being like a sort of mentor to many famous chefs from Hugh Fernley Whittingstool to Jamie Oliver and various others. Was this vaguely intentional? Did you want to have protester? Yeah, I think, first of all, I think that if you love to cook, you love to teach, you know, you want people to know how you do things. And so I think that was very important to us to teach what we knew. And then to learn from the people that we were teaching as well. You know, it's a dual experience. My partner, Rose, who died in 2010, was a formidable teacher. She had taught art, she taught, you know, creative writing. She was a really, really dedicated teacher. So I still meet people who say that Rose taught her this or Rose taught him that, you know. And I just think that, you know, also we had a very particular way of doing things. And we were very confident that what we were doing. We thought we absolutely knew that we were right, you know. We knew the way that we wanted to cook and we believed in it. And so we thought, well, if you're coming to work for us, no matter what you've been taught before. And one of the challenges was that we had to unteach people so that somebody might have been taught in a classic French or Italian or British restaurant or cooking school how to make something. And we had to say, no, we don't do that. So that was challenging. Are there any of your mentees that you feel particularly close to whose careers you take a particular interest in and you feel particularly proud of? I do. And they're not necessarily the famous ones. Of course, I adore Jamie, and I'm doing a podcast with him next week. And I love Hugh, and I love a woman called April Bloomfield, who started in New York. And there are many. But I think I really admire and respect the people that might have just gone back to Australia to a small town near Perth and opened a small cafe, you know, and a chef who went back to New Zealand or somebody went back to Italy. So those are the people that I really also, you know, may not be well known or have written a big cookbook, but they're really dedicated people who want to cook. The other element to River Cafe is the fact that it has attracted so many celebrities across the years. What was the first moment you realized, hang on, that's a really famous person that sat at Table 4? Yeah. Well, Table 4 is a sort of pun on the word 4. So, I mean, Michael Kane always sits at Table 4. used to. And now it's a bit of a long walk to the door, so it's on table 10. But table, I think the thing about celebrities is that it's really fun when a celebrity comes in and it's exciting and it's, you know, everybody gets a bit of a buzz when, you know, yesterday Bono was there or, as I said, you know, Michael Kane or a lot of times it's a very, it's a very revelatory thing about celebrities is that I don't know many of the ones that the 20-year-old chefs are excited about and the exact reverse for, you know, I can say, gosh, there is so-and-so over there, and they say, who is that? You know, they didn't care. So celebrities are fun. I think chefs, other chefs coming in are really exciting. You know, there was a time, I don't know if any, you know, Tina Turner, you know, had a nap on the bar very late at night while she's waiting for a cab. You know, we've had, I don't know, I love athletes coming in, you know, somebody came in once after getting a gold medal. But, and I think in the end, you really want to treat everybody as if they were a celebrity. You know, our goal in the River Cafe is that people come in, you never know why they come to a restaurant. They might have saved up for it for months, or they might have won a prize, or they might have had a terrible day, and they just, want to be taken care of or they might want to propose to somebody in marriage. So you never know. So our role as the chefs or the managers or the waiters or the bartenders or the kitchen porters who wash the plates is always to think, how can we make somebody happier when they leave them when they arrived? You said the chefs get quite excited when there's a celebrity to cook for. Can you notice and did you feel yourself when you were cooking that there is a an additional pressure, stress and excitement in cooking for a famous person, particularly a famous chef? I think a famous chef is the one that I would choose that the pressure is on. I think a celebrity is kind of fun and exciting and, you know, it gives you a bit of a buzz and, you know, there's only one person that the whole restaurant went completely silent for when she walked in. Can anybody guess who that was? That's my, who'd you say? Who? Taylor Swift? Taylor Swift? Princess Diana? No. She walked through the restaurant. People looked, but no. Any suggestions? Come on, Guy. The queen? No, she's never been. It was Madonna. It was Madonna. It was really interesting that. Madonna just, and it was about 15 years ago, but it was interesting that that kind of stopped every, and we've had Paul McCartney, we've had, as I said, you know, lots of people. But she, everybody went silent, yeah. Yeah. Who's the scariest person you've cooked for? Scary in what way that I wanted to impress? Yes, yeah. Oh, then it would be a chef, yeah. I can't say it might have been, you know, Rose, my partner, you know, if she would come in for a meal, then I'd really want her to have a great meal. And I, you know, it would be somebody like that, maybe my husband, maybe, it wouldn't be, I don't know who scares me, but it wouldn't definitely would not be a celebrity. would not be a celebrity. It would be somebody who really cared about food, I suppose. Why do you think River Cafe attracted such an atmosphere of being a celebrity hub? I think it's the location? Do you think it was the community atmosphere? Certainly is not the location because we're quite far away out of the center of London. I hope that whether people are celebrities or not, that they come because they know they're going to be in a place that has a drama. You know, it's got one big room and it has light and it has kind of energy and it has a big pink wood oven and you can see all the chefs cooking. And I hope that that's really why they want to come. It seems very much that River Child is, River Cafe is your child and something that you care deeply about and you dedicated a huge amount of your life to. Where do you see the future of River Cafe? Well, we just, you know, again, we think about, you know, every day is a different day, you know. So if you'd asked me three years ago, I wouldn't have thought we had a shop. If you asked me, we have an online shop. If you asked me two years ago, I wouldn't have known that we were doing podcasts, you know. If you'd asked me one year ago, I wouldn't know that we have a new space where we have another private dining room called Sylvia's after my mother. So I think, do I sit and think about a plan for the future? It doesn't quite work like that. You know, it works much more on the basis that, you know, how can we be not bigger or more important, but how can we be better? You know, how can our staff feel more engaged and challenged? How can we have a more beautiful dining room? How can we, you know, make it so that, you know, it's challenging about the prices, but how can we make it that is a place where people feel they can come to and have a pasta if they can't afford for courses. How can we make a restaurant that is sustainable? That's the future. How can we make a restaurant where we know the ingredients? So I think every day I walk in those doors is a challenge. And so the challenge of the future is it's strong. And we really had a hard time with Brexit, and we had a hard time with the pandemic. you know, so both of those things that you don't know, you know, how it's going to work out. But still going strong and rebound, you can both. We are, but, you know, with respect to other restaurants that had a harder time and had to close, I would say that we also had a hard time. We, you know, it wasn't easy to close for eight months at different times. And it was uneasy to, you know, be careful so that we, you know, people didn't get sick. and I think that we are doing well. I have to say we're really lucky. We have busy nights and we're paying back the debt that we had to borrow from being closed. And so we're on a run out and around, which is exciting. It's really exciting to see how much people want to eat out, you know, how people get pleasure. If you'd ask me, you know, four years ago, what? makes a city, I'd say, you know, museums and libraries and concert holes and schools and hospitals and parks. And then when I think restaurants closed and they couldn't go to a restaurant, I think a lot of people really missed restaurants. And we noticed that when people came back, after being closed, they were quite emotional. People started to cry just being in a restaurant again. And I thought that's interesting that we do contribute to a city. Would you ever consider a franchise of river cafes, or do you think that that's antithetical to its purpose? Yeah, it's a problem. I think that people do it and they do it really well. For us, you know, it's always a question of control and quality. So would I want to open a restaurant in L.A. or New York or Miami or Dubai or, you know, Singapore? I've been asked to do all that. And I suppose the people do it, and they do it, as I said, you can do it. But I think I've always been, and we've been nervous about how you retain control of the quality. I wouldn't want you to go into a restaurant in some city and say, it's bad enough. And people would say they went into the River Cafe and had a mediocre meal. But at least we're there. They can write to us, and I can call them, and I can know who they are. You know, there's a contact. So, and as a franchise, you'd have to, I think you'd have to probably compromise on the cost of ingredients. And so you'd have to probably buy mozzarella that wasn't buffalo, or you'd have to get bread that might not be sourdough. You know, it can be done. Or we could do that and charge less. But it's, I think I'd might rather open another restaurant than have a franchise. But, you know, somebody made me an offer. We would look at it. Conveniently for me, you mentioned your podcast in the answer to one of the previous questions. Where did the idea for the podcast come from? And have you been pleased with it so far? Have you enjoyed it? Oh, I love it. Yeah. It's, I think it was during lockdown that we were thinking about what could we do to reach out to the people who can come to restaurants. And how could we also do something while we were unable to be a restaurant that we could do? And I think I went many, many years ago I went to a restaurant in Brooklyn and they had a radio station and I thought it would always be fun to do something called River Cafe Radio and to have a radio station in the restaurant to interview people who came for dinner and asked them what they were doing in London or what they wanted to eat or whatever and then we just I can't remember but we talked about possibly having a little podcast where you just read a recipe every day. That would it. You know, every day, 365 days of you'd hear one of us reading a recipe. And then I approached a friend of mine who has an online newspaper in New York called Air Mail. And he said, Ruthie, it's an idea, but really you need to segue into a story from that. You need to do something more. So then we came up with the idea that you'd, you know, we'd find a guest, they'd read a recipe. And then that would go into a story of what food meant to them. And so we did the first one with Michael Cain, and we didn't know really what we were going to do with it. But he was great because he had such strong memories of the war and post-war and what it was like to have to move from his little house and wherever he lived. actually in South London to being given a house by the government and they had a kitchen. He spoke a lot about gardening and it was a wonderful conversation. He talked about his mother. He talked about cooking. He talked about his children. And so that was our first one. Then we did Wes Anderson and he was eccentric and wonderful. And the third one I did, I think we had three. And the third one might have been a friend of mine, Jake Gyllenall, who's an actor. And so we had those three. And with those three, we approached a media company in New York. And they listened to snippets from each one of those three. And they just said, yes, we want them. And, you know, he signed an agreement. We had to sign up for 48 for the first year. It would be one every week, except for four weeks. And so then it just became a process of getting, and it was lockdown as well. So people were, you know, happy. to do them by Zoom or come in and we'd meet outside. So we just did, we started doing them. And I think because if I'd asked Paul McCartney, he was our fourth, you know, if I'd said to him I want to do a podcast about the Beatles, he would have said no. But if I said we're only going to talk about food and food memories, he said yes. And then more and more and more people said yes. And David Beckham said yes. and Nancy Pelosi said yes. We've had an amazing group of yeses. And so that's, I've been very, very fortunate. I think they probably all wanted to have a table at the river cafe so they didn't say no. But it's been great. You asked me upstairs, who the one person I'd like to have come to the Oxford Union is. Who's the one person you'd like to have come on your podcast? Oh, well, I think, again, it changes. I would have liked to have had Michelle Obama or Barack Obama. I would have liked to have had my husband who died a year ago, because I think he would have been great because he grew up in Italy and lived. I would have liked to have Serena Williams because I love tennis and I love her. But I'd also like to have the person who produces our wine in Italy and the person who makes our tomatoes in Puglia. I think there's a lot of room now to have people who are not necessarily a big name or celebrity. but who are really integral to making, you know, the food better. I've heard your podcast described as Desert Island Discs, but with food rather than music. Do you think that's a fair description? I do because I think that Desert Island Discs, you know, when you choose a piece of music that you love, it brings back a memory. When you talk about, you know, my first question is always, what was it like growing up in your house? Did your mother cook? did your father cook? And then they start talking about it. Their father might not have cooked because, like Pete Davison's, he died at 9-11. Or their mother might have been a single mother and she worked all day. And so they went like Rick Rubin. They had takeaways. Or Paul McCartney's mother died when he was 14 and taught him a recipe that he still cooks of mashed potatoes. So really food is a way of, if I've ever, if I've been a way of, if I've been a good, I'm a good, I'm to ask any of you or ask you, you know, what did you grow up with and who cooked and did you sit down to family meals and did you, when you left home, did you cook for yourself? All that is really part of a story. And then my last question, Kirstie Young, who does the Desert Island is, said to me, Ruthie, you have to have one question, you ask everyone. And so I didn't want that what would be your last meal question, which I often get asked. And so I asked if food is hunger and food is sharing and food is exciting and an adventure, it's also comfort. And so I ask everybody what would be their comfort food. And again, that's quite revealing. What would your comfort food be? My comfort food would probably be pasta with tomato sauce. Yeah. Just Pomodoro sauce. Yeah. Very nice. I suppose you also give me my other next question, which is, what was it like growing up? Did your mom cook? Did your dad cook? Did my mom cook? Did my mom cook? Yeah, my parents were both. They both worked. My mother was a librarian. My father was a doctor. And we grew up in a small town in upstate, New York, Woodstock. And so my grandmother, my parents were, my grandparents were immigrants. The other thing that's interesting about the podcast is that most people, a lot of people, memory is much more about their grandparents cooking than their parents. The grandmother features, particularly in immigrant families. And I think in my family very much so, my grandmother was a, you know, arrival one side from Hungary and the other side from Russia. And so they were, they were Jewish, they were poor, they lived on the Lower East side. But they really cared about food, my grandparents, and my grandmother especially. And so I think we always ate fresh food. You know, we grew up in a rural community, so we bought a lot of food, especially in the summer, in the markets. The stands, you know, in America there, every farm has a stand where you go to. So we did that. We ate simply, but we ate very well. It's interesting what you say about the family importance, particularly of parents and grandparents and food. And one of my earliest food memories is my grandmother getting a lasagna at the argo and my sister crying because she hated lasagna. But I was wondering, do you think that that has shifted in the last couple of decades as more and more people eat out more regularly, use ready meals or fast food chains? Do you think that family, personal, cultural connection to food is waning? I couldn't really say because I'm not a statistician or I don't know the figures because I also think that it's very easy to say, oh, you know, nobody cares about food anymore and everybody orders in and families don't sit down to a meal. I think what's happened is that you know, a lot of women are working and I think that the idea that the woman was at home all day, you know, preparing a fantastic meal, a lot of women working during the day and some women are working during the night. And so you might prefer to sit down and do the homework with your child than cook a meal. I don't know. I don't like to judge that too much. But I think that I think, yeah, I think, but I mean, it'd be foolish to say that people aren't ordering out and that people aren't going, you know, I think restaurants are very, very different. The people that I interview are very often a bit older, and so they grew up in a time when going to a restaurant was a big deal, you know, and that a lot of them measure almost their success as their ability to eat in fancy restaurants. You know, they remember, David Beckham can remember the day that he was, you know, went to a restaurant, didn't have to look at the prices, but he was so overwhelmed. He didn't know what to order, you know. And so then as he became more and more sophisticated and more wealth, he was able to function very differently in restaurants. So, but I do think, I do think it is, I do think the notion of a meal is important. I do think sitting at a table with your children and feeding them is important. But I do think, I do think, I do think sitting at a table with your children and feeding them is important. But I do think, but I do think the notion of a meal is important. But I do think the notion of a meal is important. I do think, but I do think, but I do think the I do think the I do think I do think I do think I do think I do think I do I do I do I do I do I do I do I do I do I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I really have empathy for people who can't. Final question for me, before we open it up to the floor, of all the podcasts you've done with the grace and the good and the people who work for you or whatever, is there any moment, any podcast that particularly stands out as being notably moving, significant, important, your favourite podcast? It's hard to say a favourite, but I think there was a really compelling and beautiful, time with Tracy Eman, the artist, who grew up so poor that the Salvation Army cooked, you know, her Christmas dinner. And she was talking about coming to London and having, you know, literally no money and what that was like to really want to eat and what she did in order to get some food and what she had to sacrifice to get food was very moving. And I think that talking to Steve McQueen, the film director, was also talking about being an immigrant and coming to this country. And so I think that one of the things, again, about the podcast is that what makes them quite special is that there's very little entitlement from the people who talk. And people did grow, you know, not everybody grew up poor or suffering. There are people who grew up with wealth. Nancy Pelosi's father was a mayor of Baltimore and she's never sat down for a meal ever in her life without a tablecloth. And Al Gore, you know, his father was a senator. And they, you know, so I think, but it's just so moving to listen to people tell their stories. You know, Judy Dench trying to cook eggs for her agent that she wanted to impress. And he said something like, well, Judy, you are a really good actor. but you're a pretty bad cook. So people tell quite sweet stories. Right. Now's the time. If you have any questions, please raise your hands on membership cards, and I'll pick on you. We'll go to Adam. Thank you for such an interesting thought. You've been cooking for 35 years quite a long time. Have we found it creatively designing the menus as people's tastes have changed? There's been more diet restrictions, vegetarian and vegetarian, beginners and etc. How do you find that sort of creative process over the last three and a half decades? To repeat the question into the microphone, the question was, have you found the process of creating menus has changed over the years when dietary requirements and tastes have shifted? I think it's actually, it's exciting now. People are much more adventurous. I always give credit to low-cost airlines, you know, that people were able to go to Italy, you know, go to Czechoslovakia, go to France, go to Greece, and come back and want to eat the food that they've eaten in other countries. I think when we first did, the first cookbook, people would say, okay, it's very well to ask us to have salted anchovies, but we can't get them anywhere, you know. And so I think now that you can order everything online, and so people are much more adventurous. There are what you call the dietary restrictions. We have a, because we have an Italian menu, and we are so reliant on seasonal vegetables and restaurant. There's always something that someone who doesn't eat fish or meat can eat, and they can see it on the bar. We have big plates of roast pumpkin or brazed spinach or roasted tomatoes. And so I think that we really find it exciting, that our access to ingredients, that we do have able to source that. And I say, you know, really people eat out so much more that they're kind of open and excited. So I find it actually much better now than it was. I thought you were going to say that you give credit to budget airlines because of the food they serve. No. As generous of you. No, no. Next question, please. We'll go to Leo. I was wondering what you think about the political dimension of food. So always food is especially when it's been imported from Morocco or Mexico. Yeah. And then in the western context, there was the sort of, movement that's moved into local community movement. I know there are a lot of very gourmet restaurants now trying to source everything's very locally. So I was just wondering what you think increased climate awareness of important food. I think it's crucial. Yeah, no. It's crucial. Sorry, I'm sorry. To repeat for the recording, sorry. The question was, what do you think of the political element of food, particularly things like the slow food movement, locally grown food movement, and particularly to move into a sort of climate, food environment. I think it's crucial that we are all politically, socially engaged in food. It's, as you say, we try the River Cafe not to bring anything by plane. The only thing that comes by plane is that there's a mozzarella. We try and source as much as we can from local farmers. It's a challenge though. We can't. But we do get all our fish from the British coast. We get all our meat from the countryside in Scotland or Wales or locally. We can't rely on vegetables because we're Italian. So they come by truck from Milan. We try and, you know, wastage is a big problem. And so we really are very careful about, we feed our staff, what the food that we've cooked that night, so we don't bring in cheap chicken or fish ringers or whatever. We really try, the chefs, I think, take pride in really using up the food that we have. I think that we have a crisis in terms of how we're going to feed people, how we're going to feed a city of 25 million or of 18 million, how you bring food there, how you make it sustainable. And most of all, politically, how we feed people who can't afford to buy food. You know, I think that not to use our ex-I don't call, I don't use his name, but the ex-president word, it's a disgrace, but it is a disgrace that we have schools where children have to pay for food, you know, if they are under a certain level of means. I think everyone, every single child, whether their parent makes a million dollars or pounds or, you know, as on welfare, should have a free meal at lunch. I think we know that their children, I'll go on my little rant here, but there are children. who are eating one meal a day, you know, and what we're trying to do now is to make lunches in schools nutritious because we know that these kids are not going to eat at night. So tell me about a society that cares, you know, politically, so little for their children. And that's a huge, and someone who runs an expensive Italian restaurant, you know, it's not comfortable to say I care about that, but I do. It's slightly tangentially related to Leo's question. I have a question about politics and food. Do you think that it can be a form of cultural appropriation to normalize or westernize the food of other cultures, or do you think that food is food and it's there to be shared and enjoyed by all? Well, it's hard to answer that. Do I enjoy going to a Greek restaurant in London? Do I enjoy going to a Chinese restaurant in China? Do I think if I'm not Italian and I opened an Italian restaurant, you know, I think appropriation is wrong probably, you know, in any, how you do it. It depends what you're doing with the food and the culture and how you credit the culture. It's a complex question. No, I'm not sure. Next question please. I'll go to the member here. I just say it's incredible to see you speak. I've worked in kitchens for a few years before and you've always been like something of an inspiration, so. Thank you. Very cool. I'm just wondering you briefly touched on Brexit and I imagine you've addressed it before, but how has it impacted like hiring staff? Yeah. Yeah. And how do you see your way forward? Well... The question was, what's been the impact of Brexit on hiring staff, food costs, etc? Um, I'd say it's been, it's a disaster, you know, I think that I, you know, in terms of, you know, being a city where there, you know, a restaurant where there was open doors that you could, you know, I used to go to Italy and meet somebody and, you know, they'd say, come and cook with us, and they'd come, you know, to meet a waiter in France on a ski lift as I did, and say, come. And to say that, you know, we had a chef from Pierre Monte who came with his own rolling pin and taught us how to make pasta, and we just can't do that anymore. I mean, I paid, you know, a lot of money recently just to get a visa, thousands and thousands of pounds to get a visa for someone who we thought would be an amazing would be an amazing sommelier from Italy who really knew about wine and emotionally I think it's really hard for the people who were working from foreign countries in our restaurant they felt they went home you know a lot of people have left and I think you know I would really put the people first you know the idea that you know the talent and the interest in the excitement of having people from other countries working there, which is, you know, really challenging now. And I also think that, I mean, you know, in terms of, we do these gift boxes every year, and they're kind of the antidote to the Fortnames hamper as a way. And so we packed them with, you know, the linen napkins that we use in the restaurant, and we packed them with cakes that we made, you know, in the pastry kitchen. And we sold, you know, 800 all over the world. And this year, you know, we put our cookbook in, we had a cake, we had napkins, and, you know, FedEx came and told us that we could not sell any to Ireland, you know, because we could send no linen to Ireland. We could sell no cake with butter to Ireland. And, you know, for some reason we couldn't sell our cookbook. And I'm just saying it was the same in Italy. And that the fact that we couldn't, you know, and we bought her chocolates from Turin to sell to America. And, um, She said it would be better to send them directly to America rather than they'd go through Britain. So it's sad. You know, I don't see any, any, any benefit, any positive effect on the restaurant at all. Yeah, one more question. I'll go to Jason. Yeah. So I think in California, and very prominent there is the slow food complaint, where mostly by the work of Alice Waters. Yes. How influenced has your work and your philosophy been by the social? slow movement, particularly with regard to Alice Waters and Thomas Keller. I doubt that I'd have a restaurant if it wasn't for Alice Walters. You know, she was from the very beginning that Rose and I opened. You know, a woman who really had the values and the ethics and brought farm to table. And, you know, she was hugely important and a friend. I think the slow food movement, which is also in Italy, and I think it's, we're all looking at ways to be more sustainable, to, as I said, to be more involved in the environment, to, you know, how was that pig bread? How was he fed? What was a carrot grown? You know, what was the, what is the soil? All that is very, very important to us. And so I don't think that's what I will be, I will be. Like Alice, I don't know that it's what the River Cafe maybe is, you know, in terms of a leader in that. I have some problems with some food. I do because I've eaten some of the food that is, that is not Alice's, but some of it. And it's not food that I would actually cook. You know, it's all, it's all very, you know, it's of a kind of philosophy. But sometimes I think the actual cooking is not what I would. do. So it's a complicated question, but I have huge respect for Thomas Keller. I think he's a great teacher and he's, you know, what he's done with Napa Valley is great. But, you know, California, Wolfgang Puck, Alice Walters, all of the, you know, they really were, they did it way before we did. To finish then, I think you're entirely right in that there should be one question that you ask everyone. One question I ask all of our speakers, and I hope catches on, it's my one legacy, is if there is one piece of advice you could give to the members of the Oxford Union and the students of the University of Oxford, what would that one piece of advice be? Advice. Don't listen to advice. Don't let anybody give you advice. I don't know. I'd say, you know, it'd probably be what many people have said, which is to, you know, you know, know, don't never lower your expectations and to, you know, aim high and to, you know, to go slow, I suppose, in what you do to trust time, not to, you know, I just think having time to think and listen. I suppose, you know, like my ex-president Barack Obama, I would say listen, you know, listen, probably. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking Ruth.
