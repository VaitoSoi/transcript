 I now look to Professor Linda Woodhead to continue the case for the proposition. organized religion and its remarkable contributions to society and culture, I feel a little bit foolish standing here defending the motion that the house would move beyond organized religion. This chamber, where we're sitting, owes its very form, like the House of Commons, to a collegiate chapel. Oxford University is in many respects a Christian foundation. Many of the founding members of this debating society were, like Gladstone, devout church people. Organised religion made all of this, and on a rather more minor note, it made me too. I was raised in it, studied it, and started. my career as a tutor at Rippon College Cudson, which is a Church of England training college just up the road from here. And since then, my research has involved travelling the world, studying religion, and talking to religious people, and I am religious myself. Unexpectedly, it is precisely this deep exposure to organised religion that has changed my mind about it. Organised religion is in decline around the world. At first it was Europe that led the way in unforced secularity. It was followed by Canada, Australia and New Zealand. And recently, even the USA, which was once thought to be uniquely and exceptionally religious, has seen dramatic decline. You may be thinking, well, yes, but isn't religion doing very well elsewhere in the world? Indeed, it is. But it's not organised religion that is doing well. It is disorganized religion. Take Hinduism. Hinduism is a fantastically disorganized religion. and ancient religion that shows no sign of decline. Recent polling by the Pew Research Centre finds that 97% of Indians, 97% both Hindu and Muslim, say they believe in God, with 80% being absolutely certain. Here in Britain, the figure for certain belief in God is nearer 25%. What's more, all three of the fastest growing forms of religion in our times are disorganized forms. Pentecostal varieties of Christianity, which have been growing fast around the world since the 80s. revivalist and resurgent forms of Islam and various kinds of alternative and personal spirituality from wicker to neo-paganism to revived interest in things like tarot and astrology often stigmatized, often despised, and I think that's pure prejudice. I will take a point. Two of the religions you mentioned have deeply putrefied religious texts that are nothing but more than is that they're drawing on. And the third has a great degree of literature, astrology, pseudo-written. Is this a question? How do you say that the things would have great amounts of texts they draw for in a very important? They're disorganized. To imagine that these things I've just been talking about and those forms of religion are purely individualistic, that they're atomized, that they're wholly personal, that they have no forms of agreement or authority is wrong. There is a spectrum between highly organized and disorganized forms of religion, but none are just individualistic. That is correct. Both offline and increasingly online, the sorts of religion I've been talking about, convene and communicate and share things and develop their culture in looser voluntary ways. So yes, they are not completely and utterly chaotic and individualized. Neither are they organized in the way we understand when we think about organized forms of religion like the Catholic Church. Well, what I've been saying so far is really just about facts, about what's been happening in the world. But what about the evalative part of would move beyond? Should we? That's a personal question. It's a question each one of us has to address. So let me start by answering it personally. For me, I admit, it has been a personal tragedy to lose the plank of my identity and commitment that was being a member of the Church of England in which I was born, in which my parents brought me up, which I hope to give my life and attention to. I found it extremely hard to let go of that. plank of my identity and commitment. But it's also been liberating to name the harm the organised religion has done to me and to others and to leave it behind. The underlying problem, I think, is that organised religion has a fatal tendency to act in the interests either a polity and a society. or the organization itself. Rather than for God or spirit or the universe and the greater good, it is true that it too often acts for the few and not the many, and it acts for worldly rather than spiritual or moral reasons. Now today, that allegiance between, religion sanctifying a polity, a state and a society, it's still there, and we still see it in some parts of the world. Russia would be an example. But elsewhere, including in this country or in the Republic of Ireland, that connection has snapped. The churches no longer reinforce English identity, Scottish identity, the chapels no longer reinforce Welsh identity, the Catholic Church no longer reinforces the Irish state and identity. But what happens isn't better, it's just as bad. The organisations themselves become self-serving, oversacralised, abusive, intolerant. They claim an exclusive possession of the truth, and all too often they practice mind control. We can see this in how religious leaders have claimed and still claim exemptions from the laws that bind the rest of us, like equality and non-discrimination law. We see it in how they are still resisting any forms of external oversight, including in relation to child sexual abuse, and using the name of religious freedom to do so. Sadly, politicians have been and still are too ready to bow to the claims of religious organisations and their leaders as if they are too big or too good to fail. They are not. Let me say in conclusion that I have a lot. nothing against organizations. By organizing, we get things done more effectively. But religious organizations are different. You do not need to be part of a religious organization in order to be religious any more than you need to belong to an ethical society in order to be good. religious organizations have had their day and we need to move beyond them because they have harmed not healed because they interpose themselves between us and God and because they are no longer being experienced by most as living wellsprings of truthful spiritual experience. Religious organizations have had their day because they have become a barrier and not a bridge.
