 Next, continue the case for the proposition, I'd like to welcome on immigration and the salmon barrister, Colleen You. at this event and I confess that when I looked at the website to look through what sort of events the Oxford Union has recently been holding I got more nervous when I saw that the debate just last week was about repatriation. Now repatriation came to mind as a policy advocated by Enoch Powell and the National Front and it took me a while to realise that actually the debate was about the Elgin Marbles which was vaguely reassuring in the end. So I am a barrister. I specialise in immigration law and I work with borders every day and my focus tonight is really on people. So I represent refugees, I represent families, I represent workers, I represent other individuals, sometimes businesses. And all of them have problems, usually severe ones, if they have to have my help, problems with borders. Now, I offer you this evening an opportunity, which is fairly rare, I think, which is to hear a lawyer trying to talk themselves out of a job, because borders is what I do. We've heard some talk about the imagination that you would need to abolish borders or to imagine a world without borders. We've heard the word fantasy being used, but we don't have to have that much imagination. We just have to look back a little way. So to pick a date at random 1823, for example, the year that the Oxford Union was founded, according to Wikipedia. Britain had won the Napoleonic wars. A sense of national identity and national purpose was strong and the Victorian era was soon to begin. So nobody needed permission to come to the country back then. Nobody needed to ask they could just come. There were no immigration officers. There were no passports. There was no law that stopped people from just entering and living in this country. And there were horror of horrors, no immigration. lawyers either. There were no activist lawyers or lefty lawyers or specialist lawyers or I follow these things fairly closely but whatever it is that the government is calling me and people like me this week. And what a wonderful world that must have been. I'm surprised that the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has not considered abolishing borders simply to get rid of us all. So let's think about some of those who did move here, just came here at that time. We can go through some high street names, Marx and Spencer, Michael Marx, for example, was from Russian Poland. Mossbross, founded by Pole, Isaac Moses. Burton, sometimes tailors to the England football team, founded by a Lithuanian, Montague Ossinsky. Or you think about the great British engineering firms, Triumph, for example, founded by a German, ICI, founded by German and Swiss, the General Electric Company, founded by a Bavarian, it's a bit of a German theme coming through here, you'll realise. Leyland and Co. Harland and Wolf in Belfast, the builders of the Titanic, again Germans. But not all Germans. How about Marconi, the radio pioneer, whose company was instrumental to the creation of the BBC, or Reuters, the famous news agency? There's also the banks who were behind all of this and were able to fund it, again, often founded by foreign nationals, bearings, groats, Samuel Monskew, Rothschild. Now, these people didn't need a start-up visa. they didn't need an innovator visa. They didn't need a global talent visa or an HGV driver visa. They didn't need a poultry farmer visa or a pork butcher visa. These are all visas that are part of the points-based system. They didn't need to subject themselves to the bureaucratic nightmare that is our immigration system. Some were pretty much penniless when they arrived and I can tell you that they would never get in today. So this glorious immigration loyalist era didn't just exist in 1823, it lasted through until the First World War and it was as late as 1962, 60 years ago now, that the UK government finally prohibited British subjects from the Commonwealth from moving to Britain. It was free movement around the Commonwealth until then. Think of the lost opportunities since then. Migration in a borderless world strengthened and built our nation, which is now in the era of strict borders, rather ironically, falling apart. Borders were designed to exclude some people, people of colour, the people who were othered, who were colonised and who were exploited in the imperial era. The British government was fine about white Australians, white Canadians, white South Africans, being able to be able to be. to come to the UK and in fact were quite keen on the idea. It was the black and brown others that were considered the problem and the government archives show this as incontrovertible fact. It's not controversial for me to say this. So if I read you some words, for example, from a memo by an MP that some of you may have heard of, that some of you who study politics perhaps, Rab Butler, a very well-known post-war conservative politician. He wrote in a memo that the great merit of what would become the 1962 legislation was that it could be presented as non-discriminatory, whereas in reality, and I quote, its restrictive effect is intended to and would in fact operate on coloured people almost exclusively. That memo was dated the 6th of October 1961. Now, Rab Butler, as some of you may know, isn't some obscure MP. He was literally the Home Secretary when he wrote that memo. It's not out of power or out of influence. He's not some loon on the back benches or whatever. He's literally the Home Secretary and this is an official memo to the committee that is considering the legislation. And it was the same story when the Labour Party legislated to prevent the entry of Kenyan and Ugandan Asians in 1968, legislation that provided the foundation for the 1971 and 1981 Act, which are a big part of my work today. Today's borders, cannot be separated from their foundation and history. And we can see that quite starkly with the hostile environment and with the Windrush scandal, in which hundreds, maybe thousands of Black Britons were deprived of their jobs, of their homes, and some of their lives, who had entered this country as citizens at that time and as children or even being born in this country. Now, I see this day in, day out with my work in immigration detention camps, with immigration raids on minority businesses, with deportation cases of people who've been born here or lived here since childhood, with the ethnicity of the families who are separated by the immigration rules and with the cases of refusal of entry for events like family funerals and weddings and so on. And it's always the people of colour who find themselves on the wrong side of these borders. Borders were racist when they were introduced and they continue to be racist today. And the human cost of these borders is almost unimaginable. So 24,000 people, just over 24,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean alone since 2014. That is a horrible, a terrible and an entirely unnecessary way to die. Over 300 have died trying to enter the UK since 2000. And these deaths are the price that our society is willing to, for somebody else to pay in order to maintain our borders. These borders split families with families with children growing up without one of their parents because of income and other immigration rules. They turn migrants into an exploited underclass with extortionately high immigration fees, for example, which mean that migrant families have substantially less money than their British citizen equivalents. Migrants end up tied to a particular job, a particular employer, a particular set of conditions because of the conditions of their visas, and many, unfortunately, are forced underground into unauthorised residents by weird and frankly obscure administrative legal requirements. Immigration detention camps and enforced removals, which are an inherent part of having and enforcing borders, are grim and violent affairs. There have been 55 deaths in immigration detention since 2000, over half of which were self-inflicted. borders demean and they dehumanise not just those who are the victims but also the perpetrators as an inquest into one of those detention camps brook harris shows at the moment its ongoing inquest guards were recorded abusing detainees physically and verbally and they were only exposed because of a BBC panorama investigation and this is an inevitable consequence of the existence of the sort of borders that we've got today borders also fuel crime migration and movement are a basic a fundamental human activity some amongst us often the most adventurous the most entrepreneurial and the best of us some might say have always done it and some always will and if it's illegal some people will do it anyway we don't generally speaking post-pandemics is perhaps not as true as it used to be we don't generally outlaw social gatherings or education or love or other essential human activities, people will do it anyway. And if the government really does want to do away with the human smugglers and the traffickers and, yes, the immigration lawyers like me, then it's very straightforward. You abolish borders. So there are uplifting and positive reasons to abolish borders, and I hope you're going to hear some of those from the speakers that follow, but they deny our country and other countries immense opportunity. There are also reasons of equality and fairness to consider and I'd ask you to think about the harm that borders do to people of colour, to poor people and to the most vulnerable of all refugees fleeing war, violence and repression. And that's what borders are for. That's what they exist for. It's not some sort of unintended side effect. Borders are to keep people out. So I'd urge this House to make me unemployed and to abolish borders. Thank you. Thank you.
