 Good evening. for this and last day. I just thought we should just wind this back to back to where it started. Tell us about your childhood. What was it like being Jenny back when you were younger? Well, I grew up in Southampton. I was born in 1965. My mother was a legal secretary. My dad was a marine engineer. I have one brother who's four years older than me. And he was a very keen He loved animals. So I always sort of compare our house to a little bit of a zoo when I was young. Actually, there were animals everywhere. And I was very lucky. Both of my grandmothers were needlewoman. One of them was the local dressmaker to the community. And the other one was much more sort of creative embroiderer. So I think when I sort of grew up, I was just surrounded all the time by creativity. And I think sort of making things and, you know, taking your ideas into something. you know, in a practical sense was always something that I did from an early age. So, yeah, I had a wonderful childhood. It was, like I say, it was very sort of, we all had our own projects all the time. My mum, you know, was very much a sort of creative person. She was painting. She was doing sculptures. And my father, you know, he was sort of, again, he was artistic. But unfortunately, both my parents, you know, they left school at 14, so they never got the chance to take those sort of, talents further. Amazing. So early on you had a lot of nurturing towards the art direction. There's a lot of supports having parents who were very well versed in sort of like creating clothes and so on. Do you think that you owe or perhaps ascribe your current passion for clothing to your upbringing, you're bringing you how with your parents? Or was there a moment in which you sort of knew that the fashion and world was one for you? There's a few different things there. I think in a way, when you say my parents nurtured us, I think when I think about how they were with us, they never stopped us doing anything, except for when we had sort of tea time and dinner time, it was clear the table, whatever you're doing. But they never, you know, whatever we wanted to do, they just said, yeah, you can do that. And they weren't sort of sat there helping us. We didn't have tutors or anything. It was just very independent sort of, sort of studies in our own way. And my mum would be doing what she wanted to do and everyone would be doing their own thing. And if you weren't doing something, I think there was always, you had to be doing something. I think that was one of the most important things in our house. You couldn't sit around. And obviously, in the sort of 70s, there wasn't much going on. So you had to do something anyway. So, yeah, I think, and when you did something, it was like, yeah, that's good, you know. And then we'd all be on to the next idea. It wasn't like, oh my God, that's the most amazing thing in the world. So it was just normal to be doing and making and sort of producing something creative. Oh, excited. Since it was very normal to produce and create and stuff, what was the first piece of maybe fabric art that you made that you were thoroughly proud of? And why were you so proud of it? Well, I mean, I think back, obviously, my relationship with my mother was all about sort of fashion and creating things. You know, she'd be making clothes my dolls or, you know, and I'd be one. watching her do that, and then obviously sitting watching my sort of grandmother making clothes for me, for my mum. So I think, you know, I was definitely very interested in making clothes from an early age. I think the first thing I made at school where it was sort of like a proper garment was actually a corduroy skirt. And I learned very quickly that you obviously can't cut corduroy both ways. And I had this terrible panel that used to really annoy me because it was a different shade to the rest. I think from the very beginning, if I did something, I wanted to do it well. And, you know, something like that would really sort of irritate me. So, yeah, I think that was probably my first garment. And then obviously, as I got into my teens, we'd be going out on Saturday night, go out buy some fabric, turn it into something. You know, it was all about looking very individual, very different. So that obviously sort of came into sort of making me sort of more creative. And then I think when I was about 14 or 15, I kind of lost, I was still interested in what I looked like and making things for myself. But then I discovered that there was a job being a dress designer. And then I think my kind of, then I started thinking about dressing other people. And then I think the imagination sort of opened up. Yeah. A lot of that involved actions from you. I was wanting to ask a question that relates to perhaps nurturing and help from the education system. And I'm sure you're very well well, the fact that recently the government is, pronounce potential cuts, so different types of subject matter that they ascribe low value to, which include a number of art and vocational subjects. You studied at Southampton-Solent University of Art. How useful was your time there in conspiracy into sort of what you think of the recent government rhetoric around funding for arts and supporting students who want to go into art and vocation? Well, I think I decided when I was about 15 that I really had finished with, you know, academic subjects. I just really wanted to get on and be creative. So probably the biggest argument I ever had for my parents was letting me give up A-levels and go into that Southampton course, which I think was called a day tech course. And it was a foundation in fashion. And it was an amazing course. I mean, I have to say, you know, that course compared to St. Martins, St. Martins was a different sort of training, really. that was very much quite hardcore and it was about sort of becoming self-sufficient and, you know, where it was very much about inspiration and making something sort of very imaginative. Whereas the Southampton course for me was incredibly sort of practical. I did knitting, pattern cutting, everything there. So it was a very, very practical course. I think what you're saying is kind of, I find it quite insulting to call, you know. I mean, it's always the creative arts to call it low value. I mean, that's, you know, that's insulting to me. And, you know, you have to remember that every single thing you look at in life has been created, you know, within our sort of, you know, whether in our houses or everywhere, everything has been creative. So to sort of diminish that is kind of strange. And there is a huge industry. I mean, I think fashion employs the most extraordinary amount of people in this country. I think what happened is when I was at college, there was only really a design course. You know, there was day tech, there were degree courses, and you generally, there was one course in each sort of major city that was fashion BA. And so when we set up our business, most of the people that we employed for at least the first 15 years had come from design courses. So the production manager, the pattern cutters, everyone had done design, not really trained in that particular subject, you know. And then as time got on, obviously the courses opened up, and we have courses now on buying, you know, merchandising, they're sustainable fashion, everything. So it's become an incredible sort of industry in itself. So I think it's become so much better. It just be such a shame to start sort of, you know, kind of taking away from it again. Brilliant. Going on to your love for fashion and perhaps your philosophy of art. In your book, you talk a lot about your creative process and how you come about ideas, how you break them down, how you test them, how you sort of work through resilience with criticism and so on. I wanted you to sort of talk about your artistic process from inception to perhaps when your garment is on a celebrity or a royal member of family, on how it starts from point in your mind to when it's on the red carpet. Well, that's what I love about what I do, that you can start off with a pencil and you end up somewhere, you've created something that's on a red carpet in the other side of the world. And I think that's the thrill a lot of people creative get is not just, you know, that bit, it's the bit in between as well. And I find the creative process sort of fascinating, really. And I think, you know, you kind of study your, you know, yourself and what makes you tick, what kind of inspires you, you know, what time of the day you're more, you know, sort of creative. And it's a question I get asked a lot, you know, sort of how do you come up with the ideas? Well, I think also, I think one of those things is you're generally on a role as well. I mean, we do sort of four evening wear collections, a bridal collection, possibly two or three other projects during the year. So we're continually creating. and if you see a design that's sort of successful, then you start working on it a bit more and you take it into the next collection in a way that maybe is unrecognisable, but you've sort of kept the elements that made it commercial. The best dress in the collection to me is the one that sells the most because that's the one I got right. So my job is obviously to sell dresses to keep our business going. So for me, I really look at those dresses and I think what was it about that dress that worked? and sometimes you don't really know when you've done the collection until you've shown it to people which ones those pieces are. And the buyers from all the stores all over the world, they tend to home in on the same ones. But I think the creative process from the beginning, I think inspiration, I think I read a book once about a dancer called Twyla Tharp, and when she sort of creates a dance, she calls it scavenging. So you go into this sort of zone where you're looking all the time for ideas and you're sort of collecting them, whether you're collecting them in your head on a Pinterest board, on a, you know, on a sort of pinboard in your office, you just start bringing things together. And then from that, and that sort of is quite fascinating because sometimes I can do all of that work and then when I sit down, I can actually draw something completely different. But maybe I thought it was all going to be about pre-raphalites, and I start drawing kind of dresses to go into space. But I think that, but that's okay because you've done all that work and you've got it in and you're processing it, and maybe that's what's sort of come from it. But then obviously in our studio, we've all put our ideas together. Then we do a range plan. And then from those colors, the colors are always quite first. Actually, we think of the colors first. and then the sort of concept. And then we analyze what we sold from the previous season, what we need to include in the collection for our different markets. And then we put together the collection. And it's like a jigsaw, really. You know, we've got a blue one here, we've got a pink one here. This one's going to sell in Middle East. This one would be good for America. And then gradually you form the collection and you keep going back to it and changing it. And then if you're like me, if you're lucky enough to actually be putting, cutting your patterns where you work, I mean, obviously a lot of people work long distance with that through the factories, but I'm lucky enough to have a team to do the sampling, and then you're working through the designs again. So it's almost like you've designed them, and then you redesign them when you're working with the pattern cutter. Oh, wow. That's impressive. Given that your analysis in what is good fashion is that which sells, how do you react or how do you take in criticism when perhaps the work of art you do, a dress doesn't quite sell as well as you want, as you wanted it to, but you really thought it was really good and you really like it. How do you deal with that and then push on? Well, I mean, obviously, when you produce anything that you're going to put before people to choose from, you know, you're trying to sell something. I mean, I love selling things. I love it when somebody wants what I've created. That's good. Some people are not bothered, actually. Some people like to create and they don't care what anyone thinks. But I think criticism, yeah, I think it's hard and, you know, it's harder when you're younger, I think. And when we first did our catwalk shows, you know, you have to be prepared for the fact you're opening yourself up for criticism. You've got an audience and they're going to be pulling to pieces what you've done. And some of them will love it and some of them won't. And that's the whole thing with the arts, you know, it's up to people what they think. And I must admit, when I get a bit of criticism, it hits really hard, it's really tough for a day or two. But what I do appreciate about myself actually is after a certain period of time, it's almost like I think, okay, that person was right or they were wrong. We had one show where, when we used to show in the UK, one of the criticisms was that we just did evening wear. And for the UK market, they were quite critical of this. So they were like, you know, where's the knitwear? Where's the day wear? And I always thought we'd found a niche and it was best to stick with it. And I think that's why I'm sat here 33 years on, actually, that we've always concentrated on, you know, one product, really. And so there was a sort of criticism of like, where's the knitwear? And it was sort of in the telegraph or something. And I was always a nitwere, you know. And then the following season, we did some sort of amazing little tops at that we did them like it, we beaded them to look like Argyle, and they flew out. So, you know, sometimes you can have criticism that, you know, upsets you, but if you can twist it, then you can own it and you can turn it into a success. And also the nice thing about getting a little bit older is that sometimes you can take criticism and think, is that right? You know, I think when you're younger, you tend to always think that, you know, if it is someone slightly sort of older that's given you that criticism, that it's going to be right. and they're not right. Sometimes they're really wrong. And I think you learn that as you get older. You think, I heard you, but thank you. Yeah. I think the saying goes as well, like, you know, there's no such as bad criticism or bad publicity, you know, depends on how you handle it. But you mentioned about the impacting yourself, and I thought maybe to ask about what work in your industry is like and how you deal with it, because, you know, the fashion industry is pretty cutthroat. people are not, don't, critics do not pull their punches in how they describe an artist's work. So how is your mental health impacted by the intensity of the work, but also the fact that you just got to keep going and there isn't a deadline that's, okay, cool, you stop working now whilst you're finishing up a fashion show, you're designing for the next one, as well as you're designing for private clientele and so on. How do you deal with all of that together? I think when Matthew and I started the business, Matthew was doing sculpture at St. Martin's Central and I was at St. Martin's. And we knew each other, but we got together after we both sort of graduated. And we kind of just wanted a creative life together. I think that was very clear under, you know, really unspoken understanding between us. And we took a studio, a very small studio underneath the Westway. in Portobello. And when we took it, we were, I don't think we knew really what we were going to do in it. It was just like we needed a creative space. And we knew also that we wanted to, we didn't want to work for other people. So I think from that point on, I kind of think of us in a bit of a bubble. And we, once we formed the idea of this company and what we wanted to do with it, and, you know, I wanted to create beautiful dresses and Matthew was going to take care of me doing that. running the business alongside it. And, you know, I think doing eveningware meant that we could, from a very early on, we could be competitive. There weren't many evening wear designers in the UK, but we were quite well known at the time, this was in the 80s for evening wear. There were, the designers that they were were very good. And it also meant that we could sell overseas. So within actually two years, we were selling to some of the biggest department stores in America. So I think it suited. us to keep our world sort of quite small, although the experience was quite big, you know. We've done a lot of travelling, we've met customers all over the world, we've had fashion shows, but I think we knew that the fashion world to us was something a bit, I don't know, something we, there's parts of it that we didn't really find that we were interested in being part of, you know. So we've never really done the sort of the party scene particularly. We go if there's a reason, and then most of the time we just concentrate on what we do. And I think that has meant that we can sort of, I suppose, sort of just step away from that sort of all the, what you're talking about, the cutthroatness. That hasn't really sort of come into our world. I think more than cutthroat, I find fashion, the reason why I find exciting and maybe why it's quite sort of stressful is that it is constantly evolving. You know, women wear clothes, they have a good time in them, and then they don't necessarily want to put them on next time. So, and then they want the same, but they want something different. And, you know, look at this situation now, you know, through the sort of pandemic. You know, the shift now that we're seeing in what people are choosing, you know, they want really celebratory clothes. They want very sort of flamboyant, amazing colours, you know, very different to the beginning. So suddenly you have to sort of change up and get into that quickly. So I think my kind of advice to any sort of design or anyone who's sort of running their business, I'm sure it goes further than just fashion business, is that the minute you feel comfortable, you're not really in a comfortable place in fashion. So if you think everything's going well, really think. And, you know, we obviously learned that very early on. And then that's the point that, you know, you think you've got something that's really selling. But the thing is, if you just keep repeating it, soon or later, they're just going to, you know, the customer's just going to move on. And you've got to keep coming up with new stuff. So I think that is the pressure, but that is also the challenge. And for me, that's, you know, the most exciting bit. I think the things that are very stressful in business are in fashion, are the, you know, the sort of changing markets that we've seen over the sort of 30 years, different things that have happened like the Iraq War. You know, we just delivered to customers in, you know, for the first time. So, you know, political things affect fashion very much. And I think those, of course, just a lot of turbulence, let alone a pandemic. We'll definitely talk about the pandemic in a moment. I wanted to ask about what inspires your distinctive style of dresses. You know, you talked about how you started focusing on even where these are mostly bespoke gowns and beautiful dresses. Is there like a specific clientele that you aim to care for? and what about them is the reason why I specialize in this? Yeah, I don't really know, actually. I think from the beginning, when I started being interested in fashion, it was always special occasion. I think it's probably, I like creating clothes that people don't throw away, that they kind of remember when they wore them. To me, the sort of idea of designing sort of skirts and tops that people wear to work, I mean, it just means nothing to me. I want the garment that they step out in, that they have that amazing night in, that they got married in, they met their husband. I want the memorable one. And also, it gives me a kind of price point that I can really indulge my creativity in. I can really create that garment. I think also I always wanted to do the whole thing. So whether I sort of printed it or I sort of knitted it or, you know, when I was able to start doing beadwork, it meant that I could not just get some fabric and do a great shape. I could really make it our own. And then obviously that became something that was a great asset to us because it was very sort of, it makes it more competitive and different and harder to copy. So, sorry, I forgot. That's right. I'm quite intrigued as to how why you feel like fashion for you at least is an experience. I want to go more into that because I would assume from the outside looking in that fashion designer might define their work in the visual and aesthetic pleasures that they get from it. But for you it's more about the experience. Can you talk more about what your philosophy of fashion is? I think evening wear, bridalware, they're very emotional purchases. I mean, to design a good wedding dress, the bride has to fall in love with that dress, actually. You know, she's got to, out of all those dresses, she's got to have that one. So it's not kind of like, oh, it's a good price, and, you know, it's got sleeves, and, you know, I'll be able to wear that jacket with it. It's just like, that's the one. And it's always like that. It is almost like a sort of, that's it. And you can see they've decided, and that's the dress they're having. So somehow or other, I have to provoke that in the design work. And the same with the evening wear. I mean, what I really like is when I hear that, you know, someone felt amazing. You know, people come back and tell me the stories of wearing the dresses. But I really want them to also forget about what they're wearing and actually just sort of enjoy the event, you know, very much. Sorry. But it is always an emotional purchase. There's always a kind of a background story to what they're trying to achieve. whether it's the wedding or whether it's it's the red carpet event, you know. And I like that. I like it when it's quite complicated designing. I love it. As I've got sort of older, I like doing the bespoke pieces. So obviously most of our businesses, the wholesale business selling through shops and through our own shop. But when someone comes to me, we work a lot with Dieter Vantes, who's the burlesque artist. And, you know, she's like, right, okay, I need it to be sort of a 20s outfit. and I need to take this bit off and that bit, and I need to end up like this. The more complicated and the more information I have, I love that. I love sort of designing around, you know, a sort of a theme and what the customer wants. That sounds incredibly fulfilling. You're pretty much responsible for people's most happiest days of their lives. That's pretty impressive. Going more into your career, you have worked on different films, sets and sort of like design for different films. What was it like to design for films? like James Bond, down the other day in Castile, given that these are massive blockbusters that mean a lot, not just for the world, but also for the fabric of what it is to be British in cinema. Yeah, that was very exciting. And we've recently worked with Eon productions to put together a collection of Bond dresses from the past because they're celebrating 60 years. and that was wonderful to actually look back at all the, you know, the Bond films and either take inspiration from the film or, I mean, two of the dresses were ours anyway, and then take, you know, look at all the films. I mean, I have to say up to probably about the 80s, most of the women are wearing bikinis most of the time. So, but there are, and there aren't as many bond dresses as you think, actually, when you look through. I think the best thing, I mean, it was wonderful, you know, having a dress. I mean, the first one, which was Rosman Pike, in Die Another Day. She's actually only wearing it for about two seconds before it falls on the floor because she's just jumping into bed with Pierce Bosn, I think. So the next one we did, actually, for Casino Royale, we sort of laced it all up the back, and she sort of dyes all tangled up in the hammock, but at least she kept the dress on, which was a, you know, plus. But it's really nice to see your name come up at the end of a Bond film. Actually, I think that was a little plus. actually just wait right to the end and it comes up. But again, you know, I think when you do what I do, you're sort of constantly doing fashion and collections, you know, when you get those collaborations that come along where you're working in a different area of fashion with a costume designer, it's very interesting. You know, the costume designer for Casino Royale came. She said we want a pomegranate-type dress, and we designed that dress for Caterina Marino, and she said to me that I met her about, four or five years ago, and she said that dress changed my life. She said from the minute she stepped out in that dress, her career, everything sort of took off and changed. So, you know, that was nice as well. And we've just actually sent her one now. I didn't realize she didn't actually own one. But, yeah, we did some stuff with Harry Potter. That was fun. Got to go to the film set. I've been in the big hall. That's amazing. Yeah. You mentioned quite a lot of people that, you know, your dresses and your work is sort of like, you know, inspired. These are major cultural icons. And you must feel amazing to have your art worn by them. I also appreciate with the likes of Tadis Fifth and, you know, in Tentisw and, you know, in Tenswif and, you know, and so on. Could you tell us more about perhaps which person or perhaps which event is the most meaningful for you out of the ones that you have experienced over the years? I don't think I can, actually. I think we've dressed so many people and I think at different points they've meant different things I think we dressed our first sort of A-lister I mean maybe I'll just talk to you a little about the whole red carpet thing and we started our business here in the UK you know we you know I mean one of the most exciting people is one of our very first celebrity who was Wendy James from Transvision Bamp she came along to our studio took a dress sent it back in a jiffy bag which is the way that it does happen. And, you know, that was probably one of the most exciting ones in a way because it was the sort of first one. And then when... So we started dressing, you know, people in the UK. And we were dressing a lot of sort of TV sort of people. And then I was getting more and more frustrated because I really wanted to dress sort of A-listers and people in L.A. And then we had to almost sort of stop dressing anyone for a little bit. So that, you know, because the A-listers will only wear, you know, if they're confident that other A-listers are going to wear as well. So we had to almost sort of be rediscovered actually from, you know, from Hollywood. And Sandra Bullitt was the first A-lister that stepped out with the Golden Globes. And like a lot of times, I didn't actually know it was going to happen until I sort of found out the next morning. So there's different ways of dressing someone. And it is, you know, it is very challenging because the big, you know, the big labels can often pay quite a lot of money to dress people, and we've never paid it to dress anyone. So we've had agents that we've worked with in L.A. They'll have the collection, stylists will come in and choose from there. Or sometimes the stylist will come to us, and we developed something sort of long distance. We did a dress for Viola Davis, for the Bafters, and they wanted it in sort of different shades of blue. and somebody from our office flew over with the dress, got all the way to LA and she said, no, she didn't like the blue colours. So we had to redo it again. So it is a bit boring when you have to do it long distance. The most marvellous way is when I actually get to meet them myself and work directly with the celebrity, which is rare, but it works out very well. So I'd have to say that if you get a dress on the red carpet, it is quite an achievement, actually. So whenever we dress anyone, I think, you know, in the office it's like, well done, everyone. Look what we did there. Is there a bucket list, perhaps maybe a project or artist or icon that you'd aspire to have designed for? Yeah, mine's a quite funny one, actually. I would love to dress Tilda Swinton, mainly because I don't think she would ever want to wear Jenny Packham. And I like the challenge. I'm absolutely sure I could create something for her, and I'm just such a big fan. but I've got that as my sort of goal trying to sort of work my way towards it but it's quite sort of a quite difficult one and at the moment I'd love to dress Lady Gaga you know I think we have been sort of sending out things to her recently so we'd really like to see her in something really you know I don't know ethereal I'm exciting so moving on to like talking about the industry you work on, the fashion industry, quite like other industries, recently it's been scrutinised by different movements, notably the Me Too movement, with people calling out the industry's sort of culture. I wanted to ask much more nuanced questions about whether you can tell us more about what it's like being a woman in that industry now in comparison to when you started 33-odd years ago. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think there's a, you know, obviously there are a lot of women in the fashion industry. And I think it's sort of, I think often, you know, a lot of the decision makers, you know, are sort of men. I think it's changed dramatically since we started. We used to have, we always used to laugh, we had to meetings with the bank, and we'd have our sort of new brochures and photos of our new collection. And I'd sort of, you know, Matthew and I'd be sat there and I say, oh, you know, this is our new collection. And the bank managers used to just move it one side and say, I'll show the wife. And that happened two or three times. You know, I'll show those pictures to my wife, see what she thinks. And it was like, that's our product. Push it back. So, yeah, I mean, talking about that now, you know, your face says it all. It's, you know, it sounds pretty archaic, doesn't it? You know, and that's only, you know, 25 years ago. So, yeah, things have really changed up. And I mean, things like the business of fashion and these sort of online sites now that are much more kind of serious and kind of professional about this business. I think they've really taken it into another place. I mean, as far as sort of, you know, the model scene, you know, which was, I think, you know, everyone's agreed was in a very poor state. I think we have seen that improve. I think there's still, you know, I don't see as many, you know, unwell girls coming in for castings. It's changed. But I think there's still a lot to do. And obviously what we saw from the whole sort of, you know, Me Too, everybody wearing black, you know, it's very sort of empowering. I mean, I think fashion has a job in itself. It's very kind of visual, you know, we're all connected to it. And therefore, you know, the more that we can do to add diversity is, you know, influences. Oh wow. So it seems that you said we've come quite significantly some way from back in the day. I wanted to hear more thoughts and perhaps other forms of diversity and inclusion for fashion. What's your thoughts and perhaps how much further we have to go for inclusion of, you know, or body types, orientation, races and fashion. What status, how would you analyze that right now? Well, I think, you know, I was thinking of its question. I think whereas in the past I sort of, personally, I was sort of unconsciously inclusive. I think the job now is to be conscious about it and make sure that you are, you know, you've got the balance. We did a fashion show in New York. It was a bridal show and we had Ashley Graham, who's since kind of gone on to, you know, she's a star now really. And I think we had a couple of plus-size models in a bridal show. And at the end, we had a standing ovation. And I just stood backstage thinking, that's just so much. weird, isn't it? You know, you just put like a couple of, you know, really fantastic looking models on a catwalk and everyone thinks it's marvellous. And in a way, it was marvellous, but that's really not how it should be seen. I think there is a problem within the fashion industry and it comes down to sort of finances as well, is that, you know, when we create collection, it's generally either all size 8 or size 10, because when we create collection about 35 pieces and we present it to people. Maybe 20 of those go into production. So it's a bit impossible for us to actually do all the sort of grading, which is turning them all into different sizes, until we've got the orders. It wouldn't be very sustainable of us actually. And, you know, when we did that show, you know, we took, I think we had four different dresses that we'd made in plus sizes, and then we had to sort of hope that we could find somebody to sort of fit them. There is something, you know, obviously very convenient about all the models being the same size, creating a collection the same size. But I think most women, I don't think, I never have a problem with looking at, you know, models in magazines. I don't sort of think, oh, you know, I don't want to buy that. It just passes over me. So, and I think that's how most women feel, actually. So it's just something that, you know, we'll change as time goes on, I'm sure. And I think we're seeing so many fashion shows now where, you know, there's so many sort of different people involved in them. I think we are really moving away from, you know, the classic look. Yeah, definitely. I think you also like to touch quite briefly on what you're doing to be much more sustainable. I wanted to talk about perhaps much more generally what you think the industry needs to do to improve. sustainability both in brand and also as an industry. Well, I've come to the conclusion that, you know, our company would do what, you know, companies have to do, which is they do their house keeping sort of in-house, you know, making sure that we're doing sort of recycling, packaging, etc. And then I think the next stage is looking at the garments, you know, making sure we're using recycled sequins. But I think we have to, in this transition period that we're going through, we all have to have, as you know, sort of understand. and actually kindness towards people. You can't sort of slam someone down because their garment is not completely okay. It might be that I create this, but maybe only this shape sequence is recycled to start with because it's quite hard sourcing things at the moment. But you just have to know that you're going to have to do it. The biggest, I think, single thing that I can do to try and help sustainability is to dress my... clients in, who may be on the red carpet, influence, you know, women that influence in something that is recycled, because then they're going to influence parts of the market, the fast fashion, that is really, you know, a problem. I think every minute we buy two tons of fashion in this country, and I can imagine we're throwing away an equal or half as much. Every pair of jeans is 3,000 liters of water. So it's not just the manufacturer. They have to change that, but it's our requirements for newness all the time that has to evolve. You know, and I think we have to look at, you know, do we really need to go and buy some more t-shirts, you know, and change that up by something a little bit more expensive that will last longer, that you will get your sustainable 30, 30 wares out of. And then if you are going out at Christmas, you know, get one of your evening, dresses out and do something new to it, maybe go and buy yourself a new pair of earrings to go with it rather than buying a whole new outfit. So I think it's both sides have to work at it. But we, you know, I like to think of it as more sort of regenerative rather than sustainable. You know, we not only sustaining things is not really going to help. It's we have to create a new way. Great. You sort of like preempted my next question in a fast fashion. I was going to ask your thoughts on this and how you think we can help combat its effect on the environment and also the exploitation of the global south. I think fashion is always consumer-led. So somehow, rather, we do have to convince people to buy, you know, when they go into, I'm not going to name any shops, but I often see people coming out of them with sort of huge bags full. You know, and the clothing in there is so cheap. And I think if you're buying a t-shirt for two or three pounds, you've got to know that someone has suffered for, that t-shirt because that isn't, you know, you know, I know the margin may be very small. So if you're buying two instead of one because you think, wow, that's an amazing price, you know, think again. And, you know, I think it's, you just don't need those two bags for, you know, so I think the keys, I don't know how we change the consumer. I think we have to, you know, educate people into sort of understanding the damage that it does. Thank you. I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Please remember that weight to the microphone is given to you before you start speaking. Would anyone like to ask Jenny a question? I recognize a member with the brown jumper. Thank you. This past year and a half has been tumultuous for the industry, and I'm sure you're perhaps your relationship perhaps your relationship with fashion or your client's relationship with fashion, how would you perhaps add a final chapter to your book or a next section of what you've learned in this time or how your relationships changed with them? Yeah, I mean, it was some extraordinary time for us. You know, I think during our sort of years, you know, maybe if we had a sort of difficulty in one market, we could swing around to another market to pick up the business. And this was just like, nobody wants what we make overnight. Nobody's going to get married and nobody's going to parties. And whereas we would normally sort of think, okay, what can we do? What can we do that's going to make this work? We need to sort of change out the product or the collection. There was just, we were flawed. There was just nothing we could do. And it's, you know, I mean, it was a totally. time and I don't like to sort of talk about positives coming out of it. But if, you know, my personal experience was that, you know, I had, for the first month, no one came into work. I mean, the whole thing was so sort of shocking. We were in the middle of a new collection. We just sold a collection and we had all these customers just canceling it all. So what we did was we used that collection that we'd made and we put it for the next season. So in a way, I skipped a season, which in the first time in 13th. 33 years, you know, it was quite novel, actually. And there was a bit where I felt like, I remember listening to Mark Jacobs, and he was saying, oh, I just can't stop designing and, you know, etc. And I was just like, I can't do anything. I feel sort of frozen here. And then I realized that this was an opportunity to really have a bit of a full stop in the business, or a comma, actually, and sort of creatively think. And suddenly all these designs that I'd done before, you know, the lockdown, which were for the next collection, I looked at them and I thought, these are all wrong. This is just like, we've been doing that shape for years and nobody's going to want this now. And it was kind of like, oh, and then it was sort of an opportunity opened up to do something different. And I felt kind of creatively very sort of alive again, actually. And now, like I'm saying, you know, I think evening where, I mean, if you look back to sort of, you know, the 30s and, you know, difficult times in history, are always followed by sort of boom times as far as people wanting to celebrate and dress up. And I think for us, we're going into what hopefully will be a sort of a good time for us, where we can sort of really let go of it. I just felt it was a period of reinvention for me. And that was more about time because I don't get hardly, the minute I've finished collection, I'm on to the next one. And I don't think creatively, I think this is why a lot of designers, you hear them, you know, the ones that work for the big houses, etc. you know, they can have breakdowns, etc. Because you're never having, you need that space where you kind of just re-establish and think about things and maybe you're not straight into the next collection. And it was an opportunity, I suppose. So, and from a business point of view, we were forced to look at how we were, you know, things that were in the pipeline that we really wanted to go more sort of online. But people weren't really buying sort of bridal dresses or, you know, evening wear online, particularly. we had a bit of a business going with it. And now I would say that that is how we're mostly selling our clothes. And it's opened up a whole load of new markets for us, all over the world that we couldn't reach before. And we did a bridal collection with an online site outnet. And, you know, we're seeing a take-up. I think we've all evolved with our online buying, haven't we? I think we all sort of – I used to get so many things that I had to return. And now there's less of them. I'm getting used to sort of doing it more. and it's very convenient. So there's a nice balance now between the retail experience and maybe online buying, which is something that we definitely speeded up. Thank you. We have time for just one last question. Organize the member with the green jacket in the front row. Thank you for the talk. It was very enlightening. I wanted to ask a question about. kind of your understanding of the difference between kind of fashion and style. I know in the men's uh men's uh in the men's style there's more shift from fashion to style and men's style tend to move much slower than women's style. Um do you think there's a need for kind of a different analysis of how fashion and style is kind of integrated and do you think that um in regard to sustainability that we should maybe curtail that kind of the kind of the kind of the the fast kind of the ever-changing kind of development of fashion and arts culture. Thank you. I think it's about, I mean, to answer the last bit of your question, I think it's about sort of reinventing, you know, the clothes that we have. I mean, I'd have to say that probably in my wardrobe, I probably don't need to buy anything. You know, I could sustain for sort of probably about three years, I think, you know, and I think most of us actually could manage. So I think, but I'd get bored of them. get bored of my clothes. So I'd have to sort of, I'd probably start getting a bit more experimental with mixing different things together. To me, fashion and style, when I think of style, I think of, you know, when I create a dress, if you put it on two different people, they've got two different types, you know, two different styles. And I think to me, style is that sort of what we bring to the clothes ourselves. And fashion is what's hanging on the, you know, the hanger, really. So I, I mean, most of us are so busy now. We don't kind of, I don't think we get to spend as much time on sort of, you know, how we look. I mean, it's a very giving thing to dress, to dress well. You know, you're presenting yourself to the world. People are sort of, you know, enjoying what you wear. If you wear good colours together, et cetera. And I, you know, when I do see a woman that is sort of dressed in a sort of interesting way or there's nice details, you know, I really sort of acknowledge it because it is a kind of, I mean, we dress for ourselves, but it's also a very sort of, giving thing. So I'd like to see people spend a little bit more time. I mean, during the lockdown, I thought, you know, we all kind of went to pieces a bit, didn't we? You know, with our sort of leggings. And now I think it would be nice to see people sort of, you know, sort of caring a bit more about how they sort of, we present ourselves. And there's so much power in dressing as well. I think, you know, we can sort of make things happen, you know, by the way that we wear things and we can influence our lives. So I don't know if I've answered your question, but I've kind of gone around it. Thank you so much for that. Jenny, I'd like to thank you on behalf of our members, and I would like to welcome everyone joining me. Welcome. You know, You know,
