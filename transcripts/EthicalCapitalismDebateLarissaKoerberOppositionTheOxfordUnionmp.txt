 I now look to the election member of standing committee Larissa Kerber to close the debate. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good evening everyone. And thank you Madam President for giving me another opportunity to speak in this chamber tonight. It really is an honor and still as terrible. as the first time. So, I would like to outline the structure of my concluding speech tonight. Firstly, I would like to re-center the discussion on the motion we are debating and discuss the dangerous implications of the propositions argument. I will then present examples of ethical consumption on capitalism and conclude that, while our habits are far, far, far from being perfect, we should not fully discourage capitalism. Throughout this debate, you have to be able to be able to be. debate, you have heard that the proposition avidly argued that capitalism and consumerism can simply not coexist in a way that is ethical. This binary stance, classifying our consumer habits as ethical and unethical, is however an inadequate interpretation of this motion. I can of course not set aside the harm caused by our consumptions. I mean, there is the exploitation of workers and the environmental damage that has been caused for decades and decades. We have all made unethical choices. But interpreting ethical as a binary notion and arguing that capitalism can point blank not be ethical is simply a defeatist vision, sorry, of the topic that we are debating tonight. It crushes any efforts, as minor as they are, to improve the way we act. It will not be perfect, of course, but every single step matters. Whether it's as trivial as purchasing a train ticket instead of a plane ticket or browsing Deepop instead of pretty little thing. But also joining climate protests in front of our schools and universities or contacting our local MPs to drive change. They all represent efforts which we can all make in our daily lives. This motion requires a reflection on our society and our consumer habits. It is a discussion about the mechanisms driving our behavior on a daily basis. and what we can do on a personal and larger scale to improve it. This debate should not draw a sharp line between capitalism and ethical consumption. We should see it as a spectrum and allow even the smallest efforts to further a more just and fair society. Secondly, and more fundamentally, the proposition's position implies that we ought to entirely depart from capitalism and consumerism to achieve an ethical behavior. But requiring such a change is purely unrealistic. Our economy's foundations lay on consumption, whether it is a notion of offer and demand, or purchasing consumer goods to satisfy our basic needs, but also to fulfill our own well-being. We cannot deny that capitalism surrounds us, surrounds us, no matter where we are or who we are. Each and everyone has fallen victim to capitalism. I mean, myself and my ASOS dress included, as Alex so nicely points it out. but this is exactly my point. Consumerism is so deeply linked to our habits in ways which are often hidden. The propositions wants to make our consumption more ethical. Fair enough, but abolishing capitalism is simply not a realistic position to take today. No, thank you. Requiring such a strong shift in our society will bring its new load of disadvantages. Let us focus on what is and collectively spearhead reform. This House believes that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. That is the motion that the proposition is defending tonight. So there is no ethical consumption under capitalism at all. There is simply no way one can ethically consume in our capitalist society. But may I ask you all to reflect on a product of capitalism that helps you consume her ethically? I mean, on a wider scale, think about the revolution of green mobility. Company stocks are skyrocketing, and they all sell in electric cars selling a record number each year. But that works. That works because emission-free products are needed and are needed as a matter of emergency. It works because policy makers and countries like Germany or Norway accelerate ethical consumption. It works because new infrastructures have built and receive financial benefits. A new system is being created before our eyes. a new system of capitalism, but we all make more conscious choices. Finally, I cannot conclude this debate without discussing future opportunities. After all, this Chamber's very purpose is to provide a platform and most importantly, continue conversations that matter. It is the opposition's duty to defend that there can be ethical consumption under capitalism, but also to acknowledge the flaws of the current system and submits loose. accordingly. This times of reckless and selfish consumerism ought to fade away. Our generation, our generation, sorry, has increasingly been pushing for a form, whether in private or public life. We need to spark conversations and expose the horrors of consumption. We've been doing this on social media, for example, a very product of capitalism. The battle is not over. We must push for legislative change against the abuse of workers and the environment. After all, a capitalist society cannot thrive without its consumers. We have the privilege to challenge those in power. Our needs to find their offer. If we properly change the way we consume, we can influence leadership decisions by driving their ethics. If you accept this motion, there is simply no point in striving to consume better and more ethically, changing our society's consumption culture, enshrined on our habits for decades, and dare I say centuries, is a here curiously a task. We should much rather strive to change our current habits for the better, create change, and lead conversations with major stakeholders. With that, I would like to ask you, dear members and attendees, to consider one last thing before exiting this chamber. We are all consumers and stakeholders in a capitalism-driven society. And yet, we are all, for the most part, as individuals cognizant of the deep, deep flaws of this system. Changing the fundamental dynamics of our society will realistically not be possible. But what is definitely possible is to take small steps every day to better our habits. What is definitely possible is taking a united front against the horrors brought by capitalism and create and define a new era of capitalism. Boycotting, protesting, writing to our MPs to enact responsible laws. We have this power. We are starting to realize it. We must act on it. We should not submit to the hopelessness that there is no moral way of consuming in today's society. Rather, I am imploring you all to endeavor to change your habits and to think every day about the choices you make. Supporting opposition tonight is a statement that we have the power to lead a new era of capitalism. Let us learn from our mistakes and build new ways of consuming. Thank you. You know,
