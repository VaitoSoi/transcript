 I now look to Archbishop Aben Martin to close the debate. Madam President, you'll forgive me if I say that as a Catholic Archbishop, I have the feeling of being somewhat in the line of fire. tonight. But I'm happy to be joined in my opposition to the motion by the great late Cardinal Newman of this parish, who observed that if religion tends towards a sentiment or a taste, and if it is the right of each individual to make it say just what strikes his fancy, then it becomes so personal and so private that we must of necessity ignore it. He went so far as to say in his apollogia, religion as a mere sentiment is to me a dream or a mockery. Non-organized or privatized religion is, I contend, merely a religion of sentiment. Once those aspects of religion that unite religious believers are downplayed, like gathering for communal prayer, collective action, leadership, doctrine and tradition, what informs it are ultimately the individual's feelings. Such sentiments may be deep and meaningful, but ultimately it boils down to a vague sense of being spiritual. Such subjective religion places the human individual at the heart of things. Anything goes, or as they say back in Ireland, whatever you're having yourself. How can this enable us to become more fully and authentically ourselves? Charles Taylor, in his ethics of authenticity, argues that to be authentically human is to have a system of value by which our lives are measured and by which we can live. Crucially for Taylor, it must be possible for us to fail to live by this system, the possibility of failure to live up to a system of value indicates that it is not mere sentiment, but is a value independent of us that helps to guide and transform us. Furthermore, if there's a failure or crisis in our spiritual life, it's only something independent of ourselves, a system of or organized way of being that provides an objective yardstick for us. Organized religion brings to bear a coherent corpus of teaching rather than a disparate collection of voices. This teaching is the fruit of centuries of reflection on revelation and of dialogue between faith and reason. Take... Yes, of course. The fact that you mentioned, the fact that the progress of religious has been a lot of centuries of progress, it still has led us with, for example, your religion thinking that a marriage is the thing that has to be buried when it happens, that's still worse when it was in the female. I think that it is very important truths within religion and about his or her destiny, while also to realize that these fundamental, there are fundamental truths within religion about the human person and about his or her destiny, while also leaving latitude to individuals to pursue the common good in concrete circumstances. I think the truth still matters. an ever-shifting consensus in society will struggle, I think, to provide a stable foundation for the attainment of what is genuinely good and true. I think that organized religion seeks to uphold and defend fundamental values and non-negotiable ethical principles, not in a bid to stifle freedom, but to protect it against what is sometimes described as moral relativism. In fulfilling this role, for example, as you say, the Catholic Church is excoriated in certain quarters when she speaks in favor, for example, of the sanctity of human life. And Chloe, I wrote that statement of the Northern Ireland bishops along with my colleagues. The Catholic Church is also excoriated for speaking on the nature of marriage. And this is because we're arguing for what we believe marriage to be. I think that the Catholic Church also encounters opposition when stressing a preferential option for the poor or responsible stewardship for creation. Still, organized religion continues to play a major role in local and global discourse on the common good, despite sustained efforts, including those by the proposition tonight, to confine it to the private sphere. Coleridge spoke about religion as a kind of compensating counterforce, a perpetual friendly opposition. In this regard, organized religion is well able to stand on his feet and offer a challenging, hopefully prophetic voice and an important balance to the uncritical acceptance of facile groupthink. internally, and this is important given what we heard tonight, the authoritative direction of organized religion can also serve as a bulwark against privatized interpretations of religion which can easily morph into fanatical distortions, extremism and violent fundamentalism. In this regard, Pope Francis, for example, has warned against the church becoming two self-referential. which is the temptation for any organization, I suppose. He encourages instead the importance of mission and going out to the peripheries carrying the light of faith, hope and love. At the heart of the Catholic Church's social doctrine is charity, the love of neighbor, inspired by God's love for us. Charity is for us the governing principle of both micro-relationships in our friends and family, and also our macro relationships, social, economic and political ones. Organized religion brings added value to individual acts of charity. It doesn't claim to be the sole distributor of charity. But it has the capacity for a collective response to need. It's unafraid to assert the voice of the other and to direct its members to move beyond the confines of. the self in a spirit of solidarity and common purpose. The church's historic commitment to founding and operating social services such as schools, hospitals and indeed universities, speaks to the communal spirit of charity, mission, and often heroic outrage, which is at the service of humanity, especially towards the poor and vulnerable and those who cannot defend themselves. For each of us, Organized religion also builds on the natural human desire and need for belonging and communion. We've heard that tonight. And I wouldn't be ashamed of that. We've all witnessed the importance of interdependence and interconnectedness recently through the COVID pandemic. In my pastoral experience, I see how the church organized religion offers a sense of belonging and a crucial community of support and accompaniment that people yearn for, especially in moments of crisis. And also it helps them to confront some of the most emotionally charged problems of life, like the mystery of suffering, the inevitability of our death. So we might declare ourselves as maybe disaffected or free or no religion, but sooner or later we have to recognize we're not, atomized individuals who've been created and then abandoned by God to ply our own furrow. I live my life in the deep conviction that each of us is loved by God, who took flesh for our sake and who wishes to share his life with us while we journey together on earth. The church is for me and for millions of others the vessel that gathers God's people together and communicates God's closeness to them. So to move beyond organized religion would be, in the opposition's view, to invert the whole idea of religion. Instead of faith as the reception by humanity of what God has revealed, we end up with the notion of a religion centered on humanity, which reimagines God in its own image. I don't deny for one moment that organized religion can be corrupted by power. and that institutional failings can obscure and even undermine its purpose, I have met with many good people whose lives have been traumatized by their experience of church. Sadly, this is the reality of all organizations, the tragedy of human shortcomings, of infidelity, sin and shockingly also even crime within religion. Chesterden once quiped that Christian ideal has not been tried and found wanting. It has been found difficult and left untried. For those who are disaffected, religious community can regain its attractiveness when its leaders and its members are true to their calling and coherent in their witness. That's the challenge that continually lies before me and all in the Catholic Church. and in all organized religion, but it's no reason to seek its demise. Thank you.
