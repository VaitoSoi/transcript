 Thank you very much. Your Excellency, for those remarks, they're very, very interesting and very hopeful to the future. And whilst the United Kingdom may now be the sixth largest economy in the world, at least the French are still seventh. Going back to talk about some of the things you talked about in your address, talking first about the points you made about media. And whilst I largely agree with a lot of what you said about how vibrant and unique the media culture. It was in India with different languages, small town coverage, big town coverage, international coverage, English language coverage. Obviously, in the last few weeks there was the incident of the BBC offices in India being raided by the government, something that's been raised by the British government in the House of Commons elsewhere. Can you offer an explanation for this on behalf of... Quite easily. First and foremost, contrary to what the media put out, it wasn't a tax raid. As they say, if you are raided by tax authorities, it looks very different. This was a standing investigation that's been underway, and in fact, there was a statement issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, on transfer pricing. You're aware of how transfer pricing works. Transfer pricing, particularly for tech and information-based companies, is essentially a process by which essentially the company says, here's the IP that we've created abroad, say in Ireland or somewhere else, and the profits that we make elsewhere, say in India, are 90% of it or 80% of it has to go back to where the IP was created. Now, this tax authorities all over the world, and including in the UK, often dispute whether this is a viable point. So there has been an ongoing correspondence and a somewhat lengthy dispute between the tax authorities and the BBC, not just the BBC, many other tech-based companies or information-based companies that are operating in India, that transfer pricing needs to be looked at. And your transfer pricing data is questionable, according to at least the tax authorities. I'm no tax expert. But essentially, that inquiry process has happened. The BBC was not stopped from functioning. The BBC continues to broadcast and interview and carry out its its legitimate media businesses in India. There was no regulatory intervention by the broadcast authorities. And frankly, it cannot be the case that any media entity, only because it is either a foreign entity or it is a well-known entity, should not be asked questions relating to tax. I mean, frankly, if it's running as a business proposition, not as a charitable foundation, then it is subject to the laws of the land regarding tax. And that's all the point was. So it's complete coincidence that it came. just a couple of weeks after something that the Modi government censored? I wouldn't say everything needs to be seen in the light of actions taken by broadcast authorities or by tax authorities. There is a process by which inquiries take place. And as you noticed, nobody in the government came out and said anything about the tax issue or the specific discussion around the tax in context of the broadcast. By the way, I should remind you, the broadcast wasn't on BBC World, the broadcast that you're referring to. It was on BBC 2 here in the UK. And therefore, it wasn't a broadcast that was widely made available to the public in any case in India. So, frankly, it seems hard to see a correlation between something that was not made available in India and action that was taken in India. But that's because there were difficulties in making it available in India caused by the government. No, actually, to the contrary. BBC 2 is not available in India. It was subsequently prevented on social media from being shared. But BBC 2 was not and has not been available in India from before that. It's not available on the bouquet there, not because the government has stopped it, but because it isn't available there, that's all. Why were steps taken to prevent it from being shared on social media? I think we have reasonable concerns that on three counts. One, this is a documentary that actually went out and how should I put it? it talks about a process, a series of incidents that the Supreme Court of India has already judged on. That a special investigation team that, by the way, was set up by the previous government, which is, as you know, not exactly a political ally of the current ruling party, quite to the contrary, in fact. All of these issues have been litigated and have been adjudicated by the Supreme Court, which, as I pointed out earlier, is entirely independent and entirely capable of taking its own decisions. Beyond the legalistic point, there is also the point that issues have consequence. In India, both social media and regular media, whatever is put on it could and has in the past had social consequence in terms of violence between communities. And the last thing we need is somebody else to come and help create problems that perpetrators, or either provoke violence between communities. I think our primary obligation in such a case is to ensure the security of our citizens and the safety of our public order. Do not see how the combination of the government stopping the sharing of certain content created by the BBC, followed by a raid of the BBC for perhaps genuinely unrelated reasons, could at least be seen to be a rather threatening act? That's a matter of perception. I don't have to subscribe to your perception. But let me put it this way. Do you not also see that an Indian TV channel last December, this is December 2021, was prevented by your broadcasting authorities from broadcasting material on India, an Indian program, which is otherwise, that channel was otherwise available here on your bouquet. It was actually stopped by your broadcaster. So it's not as if your broadcasters take the big broad view when it comes to democracy and freedom of information. I'm not a representative to the British government. I know you're not, but I'm just making the point that you can't have a circular argument that only stops at my end and doesn't go to your end. Moving on, I suppose, something you're talking about the overwhelming success of electronic voting and the franchise is in India. I suppose I'm asking to talk about a country other than India here. But why do you think that the extension of online voting or sort of voting booths, I suppose, has been so successful in India in rural, language, diverse, remote areas, and yet the Nigerian election, a Nigerian country, similarly to India, very diverse, religiously, ethnically, very large country with lots of rural population centers, has had such difficulties in implementing successful online voting. Why do you think it's been so successful in India? Well, I can talk to the second part. It would be most improper for me to talk to the first part. And I also genuinely don't know enough about Nigeria. been there once or twice. But let me say this. First and foremost, the electronic voting machine, it's not internet enabled. So it's the most important point that people need to recognize. It is, in that sense, a dumb machine. It's purely electronic. It captures your vote. It locks it in electronically. And it generates a paper printout that is put into a lockbox straight away. So anybody who wants to can compare and actually count and verify that the number of votes on the electronic machine are the same in terms of actual paper. Our goal is not to save paper. We're not looking at it purely from an environmental view, but to actually make elections as tidy and as error-free as possible. Now, why does it work? Now, if you look at it in a country, shall we say, diverse levels of literacy, the hardest thing to do is to be able to ensure that people actually have exercised their franchise in a way that is meaningful to them. Now, we're all familiar with stories of how in other countries, for instance, votes when they have to be recounted, you have to figure out whether somebody had actually put a cross here or actually punched a hole there or whether this indentation constitutes a, you know, we all remember in a certain country of pregnant chads, dimple chads, whatever they were called. And we all learned the word chad wasn't a country, but had something to do in an election as a result of that. In India, the way this works is these are simple machines with a clear screen and with an election symbol. And the election symbol is like signage outside the universal sign for a restaurant or a universal sign for a bathroom. The simplest way in which you can identify the party that you wish to vote for. And so people see this as a simple, easy, cost-effective way. And people love the fact that results can come out really fast. earlier in the old days of manual vote counting it had two problems one was of course the time taken which is a long time but it also had another problem which was it actually allowed for misuse or malpractices where it was very easy to go and stuff a booth you went there and you had a whole bunch of ballots and you intimidated the officials and you got people to just go and stamp on on the sign that you wanted and stuff a ballot box. You can't do it with the voting machine. It allows you to press only once and on the basis of an individual fingerprint and that's it. So, you know, people like the fact that their franchise is their own and I think that works in India. I like that phrase, diversity of literacy. I think it could apply to some of my classmates. But moving on then to British Indian relations, something I've always wondered is do you, particularly because post-Brexit especially, people in the UK, the whole global Britain movement, have had this sort of sense that Britain has a larger diplomatic potential beyond Europe and needs to reconnect the rest of the world, particularly the Commonwealth. Do you think that the, let's say, rocky history of Britain and India, but the historical connections between the two countries makes diplomatic relations between the two easier or more difficult? Interesting question. Look, familiarity is always a good thing. Contrary to what the adage says, it doesn't always mean contempt. I think in this case it means that there is an easy start to it. We have some understanding of each other. It's not completely terra nulla. You know a bit about each other. You certainly have things that are common. I mean, we have a shared religion in cricket. And certainly your Premier League football teams are hugely popular in India. So there's a lot that builds off it, right? So you have an easy context to start work, and I think that's an important point. History, of course, plays a role, but it's important, particularly in a country that, for us, at least in India, as we march facing forward, it's important not to spend your time looking at the back, looking behind you to see what the past was like. We need to be informed by the past, of course, so that whatever the problems of the past are, you don't replicate them. And I think that's an important piece of any relationship. But management of the past, I think, has been work in progress, and I think efforts are on to try and ensure that we do the best with it. This includes, you know, the bridge that our community of British people of Indian origin constitute. Their contributions to this country are significant. And 1.7 million people, it's not a small number. Their successes here in this country are also emblematic. for Indians of the success that the modern Britain can be for all communities. And I think that's a good piece. The success of Indian companies here is a good piece again. It helps anchor the relationship in a more modern sense. And I believe our Commonwealth connection, if we can actually leverage it well, is an important means through which we can amplify the shared values that we have, as I suggested, of democracy, of subsisting, of subsisting, to a rules-based order, based on international laws, accepted international laws. These are important means by which India and the UK can actually build that relationship. Speaking of the Commonwealth then, following the death of Her Majesty of the Queen, what do you see the future of the Commonwealth being? Particularly now the UK is no longer the largest economy in the Commonwealth, this whole idea of sort of primus interpara's first amongst equals that I suppose never formally stated but was always partly there because of the Queen's status as the head of the Commonwealth. What do you think the future is for the Commonwealth and what would you like to see India's role in the Commonwealth as being? Well, let me put it this way. Every institution evolves to the age that it is relevant to. The modern Commonwealth as it currently is is also a post-colonial creation, if you will. We signed up to it with the understanding that it would be a sort of a club of common values, the majesty being the recognized head of it, but not necessarily in the same format that it was prior to our independence. In other words, every country would be sovereign and equal within it. Now, looking ahead in the 21st century, I believe the Commonwealth has an opportunity to focus on being a mechanism through which a diverse set of countries, ranging from the Pacific Islands to Latin America and pretty much everything in between, are able to focus on, say, for instance, issues relating to sustainable development, issues relating to the environment, issues relating to empowerment to women, and issues relating, frankly, to the complexity of dealing with a modern global system in which there is increasingly stresses that are polarizing the world. The Commonwealth could be a unifying factor in that, provided we understand that it will have to play to its strengths. You know, the Commonwealth can't replace, say, the United nations, but it can serve as a framework through which countries that are part of the club, so to speak, can contribute to debates of the modern age and contribute through example for cooperation both in a South-South framework where technical capacities, developmental projects can be funded and executed, but also in the in a new lexicon of North-South frameworks. So we needn't necessarily get into the business of who actually runs the place because I suspect that is an unhealthy way of looking at it. It's a much better way to look at it as a way of how can we all benefit more from the institution that we're part of. Turning, I suppose, a bit then to my prior question about British Indian relations generally. And you talked about the 1.7 million British Indians and their successes. Obviously, Rishi Sunak is the first non-white Prime Minister of the UK and the first British Indian to hold the Office of Prime Minister, and he went to Oxford. So what significance do you think Rishi Sunak's election to the Office of Prime Minister has on British Indian relations? Well, let me say first and foremost, I think we in India obviously recognise that Rishi Sunak is, Prime Minister Sunak, is first and foremost, a British political leader and that he was born and brought up here. He's a product of this system. And therefore he will do as he must what is best for his country. The mere fact of his ethnic origins isn't necessarily something that we should see as giving the India-Uk relationship a special place. I think that would be doing him in unfairness. It also does the relationship in unfairness. Frankly, the interests that two countries have, they can be supported by or even to some extent guided and informed by communities that are bridges between them, but they cannot be defined by them. And I think that's important. But for the community of people of Indian origin worldwide, I'm sure that that is a very big message. And people of Indian origin would welcome it, I'm sure, in the UK and elsewhere in the world where there are large PIO communities, as we call them. And that's also good, because it's a good story for Britain also. But in India, apart from the sort of thrill that the press seem to feel about it, in the sense of being on the front pages of every newspaper, frankly, we in government will deal with the UK as we have always dealt with the UK, which is that it is an important partner for us, an important strategic partner, and that the prime minister of the day is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, Never mind what his or her name might be. Talking of those dealings between the two governments, free trade agreement between India and the United Kingdom is looking like it's ever closer. Can you tell us a bit about that and what you think it offers for future partnership and what India would like to see in it? Well, look, I think, let me start with the second part first. I think, and I'm sorry to seem as if I'm beating up on the media, but I do believe that the media reportage on the free trade agreement does the entirety of a disservice. It focuses on two basic themes. One, that we missed the Diwali deadline, frankly, which is neither here nor there. And two, that somehow this is something to do with visas. Honestly speaking, no. Free trade agreements are not about visas. Those are visa arrangements are separate things, and those are run usually by home ministries on both sides. Absolutely not. What we're looking for is a good balanced agreement between India and the UK that covers gives and gets on both sides both in goods and in services both of our economies have a certain preponderance of services in the contribution to the economy and we believe that there is a reasonable deal that can be had which will enable British services which in many sectors are best in class to find opportunities for partnerships in India. And at the same time, Indian companies, both in manufacturing and in services, can find footholds here in the UK. Our goal would be something that opens up some of the sectors. These should be reasonably obvious, things that we are pretty good at exporting, including pharmaceutical products, some chemicals, garments, textiles, etc., but also some food products and also for the UK to be able to export some of its products of excellence. And let me give you on a lighter note what one product alone could do, which is, say, whiskey. As you probably know for a country that largely considers itself as a goal to look at, how shall we say, being abstemious, India still manages to consume a significant amount of whiskey. To put it in perspective, we are your. today your largest buyers of scotch whiskey and we buy about 10% of all scotch whiskey exported maybe a little bit more than that this is approximately 3 million cases from what I've been told 3 million 2 million cases but India consumes obviously not just scotch whiskey but whiskey alone something like 200 million cases of whiskey a year so frankly there isn't enough water in Scotland to to satiate the demand for whiskey. So just to put that in perspective, the opportunity that the trade deal offers is colossal. And it isn't just about the scale of the market, but it is also about, you know, the large, sophisticated market that the UK represents, and for us to be able to tap into some of that also. Two more quick questions for me before we open up to the audience. First of all, about India-China relations. You mentioned in your opening remarks about how China has been the sort of great economic success story of the late 20th century, but how that's giving way to India. There have already been tensions on the border between India and China, China's new dam project in Tibet, the mega dam that will potentially give China control of water flows to much of the subcontinent, not just to India, but to Bangladesh as well. What do you see as being the future of India-Chinese, Sino-Indian relations and do you think that China represents a threat to Indian interests in the long term? Well that's the last one is conclusion I wouldn't want to come to. Obviously to quote yes Prime Minister when Bernard Wully is asked by Prime Minister, Prime Minister Hacker, Bernard when the chips are down are you on my side or on or on anybody else's side. And he says, my job, Prime Minister, is to ensure that the chip stay up. So my job, as a diplomat, is to ensure that the chip stay up. And we certainly don't, we're certainly not looking for a relationship with China that allows either of us to become a threat to the other. But there are, of course, concerns that we've had for a long time. And for that, you need to have the perspective, as my boss, our external affairs minister, has so eloquently put in many cases, that the basic premise of the sort of restructuring of India-China relations in the early 90s was based on one or two clear understandings. The first was that while the boundary issues are a significant issue and a complication for both countries, we would not only set that aside and allow the rest of the relationship to grow, we would continue to try and deal with it while managing it in a way that it would, you know, not contribute to instability, but we would create confidence-building measures to deal with a boundary which is extremely complicated. How complicated? It isn't just that there's a dispute about where the boundary line should run. There is even a dispute about where the lines of actual control are because of the terrain that it runs through. Quite often these are areas of, as we call them, differing perception, which means our claim of where the line of actual control is and their claim of where the line of actual control is and their claim of where the line of actual controller sometimes can be overlapping. Now this could be a recipe for trouble and so wisely both sides agreed that you would, both sides would work to not allow that to escalate and that we created an elaborate series of mechanisms for this. What has happened however of late, both there and in some of our other areas, is that there is no longer a sense that that particular dynamic is being allowed to function. And the worst example of that, of course, was in June 2020, when there were actually, you know, deaths on the border for the first time in over 40 years. Now, you can't put that aside and say, okay, let's park that as an unfortunate incident and move on, because it isn't the event alone that is a problem, problematic as that is. It is also what it represents. And that, along with other larger concerns about the process of China's interaction with us, and with the larger world, remain of concern. But, you know, concerns don't have to become a problem, and a problem doesn't have to become a crisis. And the purpose of diplomacy is to first of all try and reverse the processes that have created pressures on the border and find ways in which we can come up with a new framework by which the relationship can be managed. And the megadam? The megadam, of course, look, we started a process. by which we were working with China to source data on the Brahmaputra, which starts in Central Tibet and comes down into the subcontinent. Now, this is of course a crucial matter, and this is one of the fundamental basis on which we work with the Chinese to try and ensure that there is clarity about what exactly is being done on the river and what its implications are for downstream countries. Now, we don't have a full answer on this one yet, but it is critical, not just the fact, just for us, but as you correctly said, for Bangladesh, and indeed similar activities on the upper reaches of the Mekong River. Now, all of these do need to be managed because water is a shared resource across Asia in particular, where most of these rivers are transboundary rivers. So, you know, there isn't a simple answer to that, but the process of finding a reasonable modus vivendi on water sharing also is something that we do expect to see. And finally, before I open up to audience questions, I've read 10 minutes or so, the growth in India's experience, the social changes that you outlined, all seem to be leading towards, and I suppose the case, the state of India as a world leader, as a global power. And I'm sure in the next few decades we will see India seek to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council, amongst other things. Do you think that if India wishes to sort of, I suppose, assume its natural status on the world stage, it ought to take a stance or at least more of a stance on, for example, the Russian invasion of Ukraine? So first and foremost, let me marginally correct you a bit on that. We have already sought to be a permanent security. I was as I said it. Some time ago. And we do believe that, you know, this is because we believe we can contribute to the, the larger purpose of international peace and security. You only have to look at the way the international system is configured to recognize that it certainly doesn't represent the world of today, but the world of 1945. And I think that's an important point, irrespective of how you come to the conclusion of how that process is to be carried forward. On the Russia-Ukraine question, as we have repeatedly said, you look at what we've been saying at the United Nations, what my boss, our foreign minister has said at the UN last year also, at the last UNGA. We stand with the Charter. We have repeatedly affirmed that particular point. We are not in favor of conflict as a means of resolving problems between countries. My Prime Minister has said that at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization event at September. Our position is very clear. Merely because we don't vote in a particular direction doesn't mean we are taking the other direction either. Our concern is that the focus of the world needs to be in preventing the conflict and stopping the conflict. Let me put it to you in another sense. In any other conflict that you've seen in the last several decades, the world's effort has been to call for a ceasefire and to prevent the conflict from being escalated. That is not the case currently. The conflict continues. to die on both sides. And this is certainly not a situation that we wish to see. Nobody is saying that, you know, a ceasefire will mean for Ukraine, for instance, acceptance of the status quo. Ukraine hasn't accepted the status quo. Ukraine is a sovereign country. It will have the right to make its position and should have the right to make its position explicit. But I believe our effort first and foremost as the international community needs to be to try and stop the conflict. And I think our position has been made amply clear here on a number of occasions at the highest possible level. Now, how that plays out in terms of actual dynamics is fairly simple. We can't insist on the dynamic being led by us. But right now, neither of the two parties to the conflict, so to speak, if I were to use the word loosely, seems to be interested in anything that involves a cessation of conflict until their aims are met. But it's not just about not wanting to play a role in escalating the conflict. India has repeatedly refused to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and has continued to buy or increased substantially its consumption of oil and gas from Russia as a result in the price of Russian oil and gas declining. Are these things not actually tacit support for the invasion if you're refusing to condemn it? So let me first come to your point about buying more oil and gas. as you probably know, the international sources for oil and gas aren't very many. Our purchases were primarily from the spot market with some amount in long-term contracting. One of our sources, our significant sources in the past, has been Iran, which you've got sanctions on Iran, so we can't buy oil from Iran anymore. Another source used to be Venezuela. You've got sanctions on Venezuela. We can't buy from Venezuela. One of our top five sources of oil was Iraq. I don't need to remind you what happened to Iraq. Under these circumstances, we weren't buying very much from Russia if you actually look at the numbers. But what we are doing is essentially purchasing what's available. when the West stopped buying Russian oil or has reduced its purchase of Russian oil, where are you getting your oil from? You're buying it from the same people we were buying it from earlier and using your long-term contracts to procure larger amounts. That squeezes us out. Now, we buy, we need, 80% of our energy sourcing comes from abroad. We are not in a position to turn off the taps on our economy and say, you know what, let's wait until the contract gets over, and then we'll buy oil. Right? So what's left, the only oil that's available in the market now is Russian oil. So we will buy where we need to, and we will buy from whoever we need to keep our economy running. And I don't think that's unreasonable because frankly everybody else is doing the same. And not voting to condemn the war? Look, the voting to condemn the war, if you look at our explanation of vote at the last United Nations General Assembly resolution, we have made our views extremely clear. We are not in favor of conflict, but we are in favor of conflict. but we are in favor of resolutions that call for ending the conflict. That is not the case. Now, resolutions have to be seen in their totality. All UN resolutions are framed with a particular set of language, right? Our effort has to be that the language has to also contribute to finding a solution, or at least stopping a conflict. Merely voting to condemn a conflict doesn't stop the conflict. Our interest is in a solution rather than in necessarily being part of, part of sort of a sign on to this. Now, do we wish to see conflict? Absolutely not. Our Prime Minister has said so publicly, including in Shanghai, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in Tashkent last year. Now is not the time for war, he said exactly. Now, so obviously we're not in favor of conflict. We are in favor of the UN Charter. All of these have been explicitly stated by our leadership, but we're also in favor of a cessation of hostilities. Now, nobody's talking about that. We would like to see resolutions at the UN that actually take on board these suggestions, but nobody wants to take those suggestions on board. But even if it's not formally supporting a UN bill because of the concerns you raised, do you not think that India has a responsibility to affirm national sovereignty and state publicly that any breaches of national sovereignty are... But we have. But why would we do so publicly in the forum? But we have. Foreign Minister said it at the UN. But he was to vote saying the same thing. Because it's not covering the rest of our interests. So any bill that India wants to support must cover everything that... That's how UN votes happen. Have you seen how UN votes... They don't tend to happen, but that's the UN. That's not your fault. So look, I mean, that's hardly my fault if the UN cannot bring together everybody's views in one piece of paper. I suppose as a follow-up then, after that, do you think the United Nations has a continued role to play in things like this if it can't bring together the interests of the West, India, China and interested. Thank you for saying that. This is why we've been talking about UN reform. So yeah, you think the UN has a fundamental problem? Yes, that's the whole point about UN reform. I mean, the UN must take on board the views of more countries by having more countries that may not have been relevant to the world of 1945, but are relevant to the world of 2023 in the way the international system is structured. And that, by the way, is not just India, but it also includes other countries in Europe, but also in Asia. Brazil? Brazil? In Latin America. Anyway, have any audience questions for the next five, ten minutes? So we'll go to the member right here. Good evening, sir. I have a question regarding the war itself. So considering India's stance and their support for Russia and, you know, their individual opinion of the war, I'd like to candidly ask you of the pressure or the experience the Indian company. or the office of the Indian contingent face to lean towards the narrative of the West? No, look, let me first slightly correct that. We are not supporting any side on the war. We are supporting ourselves. The side that we are on is India's side. And our interests as any country should be are India's national interests. development, India's need for energy, and India's interests in peace and security in the world. So our position, we have explained it repeatedly and more eloquently than I could by my boss in stating candidly how we wish to see the world actually deal with this terrible crisis and actually find ways of de-escalating it and at least bringing the fighting to a pause if nothing else. That is, to my limited knowledge, the norm that has been followed elsewhere in the world, on other conflicts. And we see no reason why we shouldn't at least aim to stop violence, to stop conflict, which is costing everybody in lives on both sides, and find ways in which we can take the narrative forward for finding a solution to the conflict. Now, whether we face pressure or not, look, we're here for that. We are open to talk to our British friends. We believe that as sister democracies, it's possible for us to have an exchange of views to understand each other's concerns. And we have our share of concerns and absolutely the British have their share of concerns. And among partners, it should be possible to at least find ways in which we can find that intersect between what both of us is looking for on any issue of the day, including this one. Yeah. Thank you so much for all your insights. I actually spoke a lot about democracy and I truly believe that India, we have democracy embedded in our country but when we talk about the government in India now and I think the BJP has done a fantastic job and it's great to have a centre with that sort of the mandate, right? But how do we keep that power in check? Because these are the conversations we're trying to have big people, that the BJP has 3003 seats, the news about the Congress. has 52, how are we trying to keep that power in check? Because I think what's concerning today is not that India is not a democracy. I think those are questions in the past. There are definitely a democracy. But forward, how do we have an effective opposition to keep the government in check? It's hardly my job to tell you how to create an opposition. But look, there are two things that work in favor of checks and balances. Obviously, a political party, any political party's jobs to win elections. And any political party, not just in India, will seek to maximize its political gains. That's perfectly legitimate. But we have two things that work in India that are critical to this. One is obviously, as I said, the court system. And the court system, there is no way in which you can cherry-pick judges in India. They are done by the collegium, which is the structure that creates, you know, through which judges are appointed, etc. So the legal system is very much a separate pillar of our democracy. And that's an important check on the larger system of governance. But the second and equally important one is the fact that in a curious sense, India is also, it's not a union of states as in the US sense of the term, but it is a federal structure. Because states have powers, the constitution gives them a significant amount of powers, and states have elections. And the same party doesn't win all elections, as we've seen repeatedly. So never mind which party is in power, there is always a diversity of parties running our states. And that in itself is a means by which the political system balances itself out. Public opinion is a third. And frankly, as I said, of course there are voices that are strongly critical of the government, as they should be in any democracy, but they are critical of India's government from within India. What more do you need as a check? I mean, if they were critical of India from outside, it's easy to dismiss them as irrelevant to our concerns. But these are Indian people who have their own view of India's government. They may be right, they may be wrong. I'm a civil servant. It's not my job to take that view. My job is to serve according to the Constitution of India. And that, to me, is the fourth and most important check. The Constitution of India is clearly defined. It is a written-down constitution, and it sets out in clear terms what India's democracy should be all about. And for those who have doubts about democracy in India, I urge you to read the Constitution. I'm afraid that's all we have time for, as his Excellency needs to head off from the meeting. But ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking His Excellency for the talking questions. Thank you.
