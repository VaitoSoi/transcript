 Thank you, Mr. President. I think I can defect any claims of being a nepo baby considering the fact you don't even know my job. But anyway, I think from listening to Kira's speech, a lot of us can come together in this debate and find that, I mean, I was drawn to this personally because when I first heard this motion back in this really cold and depressing days of the VAC, I thought, I want to speak on this because I'm not immediately sure what I think. Unlike other things like economic equality, great man theory, I can't look at this motion and say, oh, snap, I know what I think about this. And so I had to take some time to really think, why do I believe in gender? Why do I think that there is a future to gender? again, I'm also a bad feminist. I think it's really funny we didn't compare speeches before this, but I've also shaved my legs tonight and I am wearing makeup. And while I consider these things something I may cut out in the future like dairy or fish, I can't really ever see myself cutting out my gender, even if it makes me a bad feminist to have one. I'm not going to stand here and tell you what the definition of a woman is. I think that's a reductionist view of this debate, but what I can tell you is that I know that I am a woman, and I don't think that's going to change any time soon. The argument for gender abolition is that gender equality is simply a plaster on a bullet wound. It's neoliberal, which is probably the worst insult of all. Thank you. That's the best joke in there, so don't get your hopes up. And that utopian society necessitates the elimination of gender. This would also, according to many abolitionists, see sex-based discrimination. This viewpoint says that gender is inherently oppressive, it's unsalvageable, and we should express our identities in simply other forms. In this speech, I'm going to attempt to address each of these points and offer what I hope will be some suitable counter-arguments. But before I begin, Mr. President, I must introduce to you our speakers on the proposition tonight. Firstly, we have Ms. Kira Rushden. Before this speech, I went around the committee asking members, oh, what do you think I should say about Kira? And her closest friends inform me, I should be very happy that she's managed to make a speech tonight after those couple drinks we had. Considering last Sunday, after an event I won't name, she became so drunk she forgot her sexuality. So congratulations, Kira. You were very coherent. Next is Mr. Rico Jacob Chase, trans activist and star of Channel 4's Make Me Prime Minister. I understand from this show you've already met an Oxford student. After hearing about her antics, I really, really hope we can make up the reputation of Oxford to you tonight. And I promise I'm not going to leave halfway through. Next we have Ms. Aaron Rose Philip. In 2018, at the age of 17, Miss Philip became the first. black, transgender and physically disabled model to ever be represented by a major modelling agency, has since worked for brands such as Mark Jacobs, as well as shooting editorials for British, American, and Vogue Italia. When researching Miss Philip, it was really distressing to discover we are the same age, considering my greatest achievement is the number of places in Oxford I've chund. Next is Hugo. God, what is your name? This is the problem. I'm so sorry, Hugo. I've never met you in my life. When I wrote my speech tonight, I have Hugo, question mark, question mark, blank space. I haven't found out any facts in the meantime. apart from you apparently really like watches. I am so happy to be able to hear from you for the first time tonight, and I'm sure it will be a great one. Mr. President, here are your speakers, and they are most welcome. To quote Simone de Beauvoir again, It wouldn't be a feminism speech without one. Man is defined as a human being and woman as a female. Whenever she behaves as a human being, she is said to imitate the male. Usually in practice, efforts to make things gender neutral fail according to this principle. Infamously back in 2017, Samir Ahmed infamously tweeted about the Barbican Centre in London having toilets with the signs, gender neutral of urinals and gender neutral with cup. leading to an obviously large queue outside gender neutral with cubicles. An ill-thought-out attempt to neutralise the bathrooms has led to those who could use the urinals, having twice the options, which naturally punished mostly women. Or in my time at the Oxford Period, which is a society campaign for the free and equal distribution of period products across the university, speaking to students led us to realize that there's a systematic issue across colleges of only taking out sanitary bins at the same time as regular bins. This is not only unrealistic during a certain time of the month, but also unhygienic. Treating these bins as neutral has led to natural biases against those who menstruate by the people in power who most of the time do not. And what's more gender neutral than numbers? Yet women are disproportionately affected by data gaps in most aspects of life. In AI, 78% of professionals are men, so it's not surprising that in face recognition algorithm studies, the algorithm detected male faces 99% of the time, and black women 65% of the time. From checking in an airport to unlocking cash in banks, facial recognition AI is becoming increasingly important, and it's unsurprising that it is the marginalized groups of our society that are increasingly being left behind. And these data gaps have more menacing consequences. Crash car dummy tests do not take into account breasts in pregnant bodies. They prioritize naturally the models of adult males, and as a consequence, women, are 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a crash, and 17% more likely to die. Related to this, almost all CPR training mannequins are flat-chested. Many students never learn how to perform CPR on mannequin torsues with breasts, and as a result, women are 27% less likely to receive CPR. If the future is post-gender, it's certainly very distant. Oh, but I hear you say gender neutrality can help these problems. this is a barrier we can overcome. We can have these equal number of mannequins and also no concept of gender. But even when policies attempt to even this playing field, they still fail. Back in the 90s and early 2000s, there was a group of universities in the US which attempted to achieve gender neutrality through offering parents an extra year per child to achieve tenure from the typical seven-year period of evaluation. The idea here naturally is to tackle the fact that women are more likely to miss out on career, opportunities, as they're more likely to take on the burden of raising a family and hence losing out on working during a critical time of their careers. So this policy levels the playing field. Everyone stays at home for the same amount of time. This brilliant gender-neutral policy led to the probability a male academic would earn tenure at his first job to raise by 19% while it dropped by 22% from women. The majority of those physically giving birth were women who used the year to recover their health on top of the pressure to raise the children. The majority of those who didn't give birth were men who used the year to get ahead and research for their career. And the evidence is simple. Gender neutrality does not and will not guarantee gender and sex equity. I think it's become a pretty predictable fact, like I mentioned earlier, that the union will have one feminism debate per term, and I guess this is it. But if I were to debate, to classify the same. debate and compare it to others, I wouldn't necessarily choose those that we've had previously on porn or hookup culture. I think a more accurate comparison would be one to religion. So, you know, the future is atheist. I don't know about you guys. I know most of us consider ourselves pretty forward thinking, leftist, you know, logical scientists rely on facts. and I know all too well the damage that organized religion has done on society. I mean, we were all at debate, well, last term, two terms ago. I'm a terrible Christian if I am one. I steal the plastic bags from Tesco's and I only go to church for carol services. But I do go and I get a strange feeling of warmth and solidarity and community, which I'm sure many others relate to. And despite knowing all those internal conflicts of Christian logic, I still cross myself when there's turbulence on a plane, and I'm also usually the only one, which is even more embarrassing. Gender like religion in this metaphor, the other side will tell you it's not innocent. It's a social construct, like Kira said, and theoretically unnecessary for society to function. But what is culture but a social construct? And what about the value that we extract from culture? And who's to say what is worth sacrificing in our culture? Who are we in this room to claim, for example, that two-spirit identities of indigenous North Americans are outdated and unnecessary? And what of the comfort that we receive from our identities? The philosopher Matthew J. Cole wrote in a paper, We should be wary of it the abolitionist position as it imperils trans lives. Cole makes the argument that without gender, there would be no transgender people, people who find gender euphoria in their identities, and writes, one of our moral political purposes ought to be to maintain the existence of gender in order to do justice to trans people's gender identifications. He focuses on trans people as a group who find themselves in the most vulnerable people with respect to gender. As a transgender man, he does justice to those with concerns of being ignored or demonized. I bring up these points because my intention for this speech is not to wholly frame gender as some impenetrable prison that even if we want to, wanted, we could never escape our ingrained biases on failingly trapping us. I want us to view gender as a concept which can be both freeing and comforting. It's a distinctly human experience to wish to distinguish and define ourselves, whether that be star signs or MBTIs or gender. I mean, I'm a Capricorn, EMFG, and Charlotte from Sex in the City, and I'm a woman at the end of the day. Culture, tradition, and their subversions, not to be cringe, but to quote the two, dead poet society, is this not what we stay alive for? Gender is at its best when fluid, an individual, a choice. It's not necessary for all, not at all. And it does not have to be binary, but isn't that where the beauty really lies? Tonight, I ask you to go forward and vote with your feet for the future of this choice.
