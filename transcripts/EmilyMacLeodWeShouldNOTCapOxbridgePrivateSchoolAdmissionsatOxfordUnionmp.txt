 Next, to open the case for Emily McLeod, it brings me great joy to welcome, to open the case for opposition, he makes me great joy to welcome Emily McLeod, Lady Margaret Hall, who studies English and French. First of all, thank you, Mr. President, for giving me this incredible opportunity to speak in this truly historic and beautiful chamber. It's a great honour to stand and speak before all of you, friends and strangers alike. To debate on a topic that is close to my heart, as I did not myself have a privilege note into Oxbridge. This is my first speech at the Union, and I must admit, I was incredibly nervous to find out I would be participating in this debate. That is, until I found out, that the other side would be from the other place. And honestly, any first speech jitters disappeared quicker than any chance Cambridge will ever win the bonus in 2020. Before I go on to my speech, it falls on me to introduce the proposition speakers. Speaking first for the proposition is Lucia Archie. So, her internet footprint was rather menial. I could not find any type of information on Lucia at all. At least none that I could say anything negative. about. She is a very impressive speaker. But honestly I also struggled to uncover anything of an emote interest, much like I'm sure the content of her speech. The second speaker for the opposition is Will Hutton, a British journalist. Currently he writes a regular column for the observer, co-chairs the purposeful company. He He writes, he is the president, designeate of the Academy of Social Sciences, a very impulsive man. You've done a lot of things. I thought I was going to drag him quite badly today. That is, until a quick thousand of his Wikipedia page led me to the information that we share the unfortunate experience of going to school in not so appealing areas of the Scottish Central Belt. So all I can say is, I'm very sorry about that. The third speaker for the path opposition is Teodor de Cthama. And a quick glance over his Facebook gave me a lot more information than Lucia. It will tell you two things. One, that he needs to change his privacy settings. And two, he loves a good quote. One profile picture caption from 2018 was simply insert Mamma Mia 2 in Athens here. And just like Mamma Mia 2, he has no nowhere near as funny to deserve the long-awaited denial or the big stage. The final proposition speaker is Professor Daniel Markovitz, who is the Guido Calibhese Professor of Law at the Yale Law School and the founding director of the Yale Center for the Study of Private Law. He is also known for his book, The Metropocacy Trach. A fitting title for a speaker who has fallen for the trap of oversimplifying the problem of admission statistics, but I will get to that later. Mr. President, these are your speakers and they are most welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, debates like these impacts like these impact their lives, they all parents and their children. So it is crucial we listen to people with first-hand experience. I grew up on council estates. I benefited from free school meals. And I have only ever attended state schools. I'm not ashamed of that. And I'm not telling you this because I think it will help me win. But believe me when I tell you that if you were to imagine the typical type of student to propose this motion, someone like me would come close to mind. Education, education, education. The famous words of Tony Blair later turned into the daytime TV show, location, location, location. Education can change your life. It ploddenshanisans, it gives hope, and that presents to so many a sense of freedom, progress and prosperity. It shapes who we are. The subject of education is no laughing matter, and whilst we have been taking shots at each other across the chamber, we are here because we believe it deserves to be debated. The stakes are high, make no mistake about that. It is with this in mind that we must consider the core principles of this debate, with nationality and a result-focused mind. performative in Candio's displays of concern did not make my journey to Oxford any easier, nor did it make it easier when I was sitting in tutorials, seminars and lectures when I finally ennived. The most effective line of thinking about this debate is to consider which of these two mechanisms to cap thive at school admissions at 7% or to not will lead to more or less inequality. it's as simple as that. And it's an ultimatum we must keep at the forefront of our minds, even after I and if the other speaker has spoken, and you inevitably vote with your feet. My first point argues that capping private school admissions only pushes wealthy parents to send their children to highly selective grammar schools and invest in private tuition on the side. So education, and he is a moment. matter of location. The most selective grammar schools perform better than many private schools, and their students pay tuition in the form of house prices, which can be much higher than the average private school tuition fee. Believe me, Oxpridge will be filled with exactly the same rich kids. Their parents will make sure of that. So, why does the burden of of education fall on state schools to absorb the masses of students who only wish to the main privileged. Surely it is about uplifting state school students either at the start of their state education or at their entry into university. The goal is to have prepared and confident working class students at Oxford, able to start on the same footing as their peers. Admission is only one site of the coin. Adequate prefaceation for the gruelling student life at Oxford's, is another. My second point argues that it is unclear and unlikely that there will be an increasing public funding due to the private school cap. While other access initiatives and capping admission are not mutually exclusive, one may indeed, and is likely to predict that a showy display of so-called access is likely to take vital resources and attention from schemes such as the foundation year, of which I was one of the first students in Oxford to participate in, and Opportunity Oxford. These schemes have been proven time and time again to actually work. Frankly, it seems inatic and inesensible to push this 7% figure as a so-called indicator of equality. By proposing this motion, team with opposition has betrayed a deep misunderstanding of inequality in higher education, but especially at Oxford. Indeed, by proposing this motion, they would have you believe that the mythical 7% will solve the question of access and outreach. Denied. Shoving Kthive at school students into my state school would not have made me feel more welcome here, nor would it have made me feel more prepared. Access in Oxpidge does not stop at admissions figures, and that does not always give us the full picture. Throwing students in the deep end does not fix inequality. Schemes like Opportunity Oxford and the LMH Foundation year have proven the success and importance of looking beyond admissions figures to bridge the educational gap. The success of these schemes are ever growing. The LMH Foundation has inspired a university-wide initiative in the form of the Oxford Astrophorea Foundation Year and the Cambridge Foundation year two. The proposed 93% of state school students in Oxford does not take into account Knamar and state distinction. For those in the audience who may not know, grammar schools are selective schools whereby students are admitted on the basis of ability. Some are fee paying, but not all, and so they can be viewed interchangeably with normal state schools. But this is not the case. Students from more privileged backgrounds will have been able to afford resources, such as private tutoring that will put them at an advantage. By allowing students to enter on the basis of their ability at that given moment, as opposed to their potential, exacerbates the divide in education even earlier than university. Kthammer schools also have more resources and take in fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds than state comprehensives. Oxford University made headlines when the 2022 admissions districts were the least, with a record number of state schools being accepted but this is misleading it is foolish to believe that the culture of not what you know but who is a thing of the past and my second point is that it is unclear and unlikely that there will be an increase sorry sorry got flustered Capping private school admissions to 7% does not mean that advantage students magically vanish. They will not simply stop existing if we just close our eyes and cry ignorance. We would be punishing the state school system when actually access does not end when you are accepted. So why does this motion only focus on that? I stand by the fact that I have come from experiences others here may never have dreamt of, but I carry with me the lessons of those struggles. I know who I am, and I have worked hard to get here today. Opposition believe this motion is not only a disgrace to the disease of inequality at Oxbridge, but would actually worsen this wound rather than heal it. Vote for the future, vote opposition, and show the tabs. Thank you.
