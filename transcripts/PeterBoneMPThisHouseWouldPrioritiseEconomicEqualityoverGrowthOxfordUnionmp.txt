 Well, thank you, Mr President, for inviting me here to the Ox of Union. It's a great honour and a privilege. But there's a better reason why I'm here tonight. The rest of my party are somewhere in a hotel at a bonding session in woolly jumpers. So I'm very grateful for you getting me out of that. I'd also I suppose I ought to thank the ghost writer who helped me provide the speech, Isabel. She's got all my WhatsApp messages but thankfully it's not Isabel Oachot it's Isabel Jackson who's my senior parliamentary assistant Now in the House of Commons My goodness me I thought I was coming to a civilised House tonight having left the House of Commons My God you're worse Now, in the House of Commons, you have to find something nice to say about the previous speaker. And actually, it's very easy to find something nice to say about Johnston because he made my case. They were wonderful speakers on the opposition. Unfortunately, they weren't addressing the motion. Now, when you come and vote, you can agree with that. But vote for the motion. Now, obviously, you're going to do it anyway. because the three speakers before me on my side. Now, the danger is, of course, when I speak, that it will go the other way. But the question isn't about equality. It was about equality being the governing factor. It wasn't that we don't agree. You know, growth is good, and you've all agreed that, but you want equality. Well, that's fine. But that's not what the motion says. It says the goal in itself is economic equality, and that's a nonsense. because I was coming to the Oxford Union, when I go to the Cambridge Union, I don't prepare anything because I can log it, but I thought you lot were more intelligent. Anyway, I decided to write something, so we'll see how far we get before you stop me. The proposal of this motion want you to believe that the opposition wants to make the rich, richer, and the poor poorer, a catchy slogan, but in no way connected to reality. By the way, one of our, you sir kindly said, we want a better tomorrow. And then I turned and saw Edward Heath peering at me. That, would you believe, was our manifesto commitment under Edward Heath. Now, this has really got nothing to do with the motion, but since you guys didn't speak much about the motion, I thought I might as well follow your example. When the UK voted for Brexit in 2016, Brexiteers like me wanted to cast off the yoke of EU regulation and go for growth. By the way, I was the poor man's lever. I wasn't like Dan part of this vote leave elite. I was the grassroots lot. You know, the ones with Farage and people like that. I just want to make that clear. I didn't want Dan to be... We argue for the opportunity to dispense with petty rules, putting onerous demands on businesses and unleash the potential of the UK economy. And the trouble is when you have a speech prepared, you have to be able to turn the pages of. It may have come as a shock, and it certainly did, to David Cameron and the liberal elite and back in Remain, just how well that message resonated with working-class communities. But it was no surprise to us. The big government socialist philosophies of the European Union stand in contrast to the values of hard work and just reward, underpinning those communities. I toured the country with grassroots out, and the message I heard over and over again was they didn't want handouts. They wanted hand-ups. They wanted to be aspirational. They wanted to improve their lot. They didn't want to be given stuff by the state. Point of information? Of course. You say, isn't Germany, which has much higher growth than us in the EU? Yes, Germany's in the EU. and the proposition would have us prioritise economic quality over economic growth but the people they would claim to represent tonight do not want their help these people recognise that economic growth drives job creation wage growth and tax revenues to fund public services they want the tools to succeed not a condescending shift in economic policy which this motion calls for. When we talk about economic growth, we're talking about the creation of wealth, increasing the size of the pie so that everyone's slice gets bigger. Have you remembered that I'm a Boris supporter? That should have been cake. The bigger the cake, the more everyone gets a bit. When the chance to sit down at his desk in the morning, he knows that without economic growth, his tax receipts will shrink with falling revenues and any government's other policy goals become redundant. and that's the point about equality. If you don't get the growth, you can't do all the things that that side would like to do. I'm going to make a party point here, which you made a party point about me. Every Labour government believes in equality and things. Oh, by the way, isn't it true that every Labour government leaves office with more people unemployed when they come into power? They want to do the right thing, but they mess it up because they believe in equality, not growth. The proposal of this motion want to reject the only way of making policy with a proven track record of lifting people out of hardship and into prosperity. And yet nothing I've heard so far has convinced me they have solved any of the challenges that have plagued every socialist government in history. Now, of course, I wrote that before I heard what you had to say, but it's true. You didn't even try to address that argument. You didn't try to explain to me without growth How are you going to do all those things That are wonderful by making people more equal Every attempt Now you know what we say here Chuntering from the front range Go on if you want to intervene No you see you don't I won the argument on that one Every attempt to create a utopia of economic equality Has resulted in terrible failure and any attempt to prioritise economic equality over economic growth would end similarly. This issue is further compounded when you consider whether the proposition would have us strive for economic equality at a national level or if it would be international. In this case, economic progress in the UK risks leaving developing nations further behind. Economic growth does not have the same moral dilemmas in the global market. If the demand from the UK grows because our economy is expanding, this is good for everyone. Post-Brexit, by removing free movement of people from Europe, the UK has introduced a more global, outward-looking, points-based immigration system. The UK now welcomes workers from across the world. from much poorer countries than in Europe. Not only does this benefit economic growth, but it also provides additional income to poorer nations from workers who are able to send higher wages home to support their families and communities. And of course, when they go back home, trained in this country, they do even better. Every single political system that has ever existed that has espoused equality as its ultimate goal has handed huge power to the state and been rife within confidence and corruption. Inevitably, the poorest, who those in power claim to be helping, suffer the most. I concede, and this is a point that was raised many times on the proposers' benches, that excessive accumulation of wealth can seem vulgar. However, profit essential is an extremely powerful motivator. Looking at the Forbes list of ten richest men in the world, the companies behind their fortunes include Tesla, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. These companies have brought forward generating, groundbreaking ideas and innovations. They don't just make their bank balances better or their employees better, but it actually improves the quality of life for everyone. But if, as this motion says, the pursuit of economic equality is the main thing, you couldn't have to have that. They'd have to be checked. They'd have to be state intervention to stop them because they're making too much money. and then we wouldn't have had all the benefits that they have produced. State intervention would drastically, drastically reduce your wealth through taxation. However, changing the level of taxation prompts behavioral changes. So higher taxes do not always lead to increase revenues at HMRC. And this wasn't mentioned, and I'm not quite sure why the opposition bench chose not to mention. mentioned this, the top 10% of income taxpayers currently contribute over 60% of income tax receipts. The bottom 50% of income taxpayers contribute under 10%. The government needs revenue to ensure there's a robust safety net for those who need it and to fund certain essential public services. It is the high earners who contribute more than their fair share through taxes. You know, when I wrote that, I wondered if anyone... Yeah, but that's a slight different point. It's a well-made point. But what the motion for the validation, not just to advance to the political, that there are a position of trying to be. The position of my attention. Yeah, but that's a slight different point. It's a well-made point. But what the motion calls for is that you were prioritise. economic equality and I'm going to run out of time anyway so I'll ignore the speech but what the situation is if we made we're leveling up our government is leveling up well okay okay yeah I tend to laugh at that as well but um but it but but what the actual policy the motion wants us all to do is to level down we could all be equally poor and we would achieve what the motion requires. And that's basically what you would have to do. Isn't the point that we're not discarded in the context. We're not saying that we shouldn't achieve. We are just saying that we should prioritise the motion. No, that is not what the motion said. If the motion had said that, I might have been on that side of the dispatch box. Probably not, but you never know. Now, are you digging that because you support me or is there some meaning to it? It's a time restraint. How many of one I've got? Half an hour? About two or three minutes. Now, look, I just want to bring it back to everyone in this room. I'm not sure you would have all worked as hard as you did in your previous academic careers if the reward for your efforts was not potentially a mission to, let me be very polite here. one of the top universities in the world. Similarly, if taxes are too high and talented people cannot see the return on investment for their time making their business is profitable, studying for professional exams, or learning a trade, they simply would not do it. Ah. Hang on a minute. I'm nearly finished, but all right. has a certain amount of gross income, that a person's wealth becomes excessive. Like, I have one to think it gets no sense for us to tax every $1,000, somewhere, and a big dollar over a hundred million in the air, that makes sense. No human being needs more than $100,000 per profit. That is unreasonable. So, does that make sense at a certain point that's actually what you're wrong. is he American how can someone from America suggest that to me that look I I mix with many billionaires as it happened because I chair the all party group for American football and the owners of American football clubs I have to remember whether they're billionaires or multi-billionaires they seem quite nice people to me but in the UK in the UK we have progressive taxation and I proved the point earlier on with the figures and that's the way to do it but not at 99% because the people wouldn't be here they'd changed it so you have to oh go on again this was something Dan wasn't it something Labor way back in the 60s or something they charged 101% on your income didn't work because you don't actually, what you didn't do, if you're that rich, you find ways of, you know, becoming a non-dom. No, I'm not allowed to talk about that. But it's true. So you've got to remember there are taxation rates cause behavioural change. And there's an argument actually if you cut taxation rates that after occur, actually you finish up with more income. So something that perhaps the chance to look at. Look, I can't remember where this speech is. So let me just conclude by saying, look, in the House of Commons, bizarrely, we are supposed to look at the motion on the order paper, which actually I do, and then vote the way that, as a member of parliament, now I'm going to come to your point. And that means quite often I'm voting against what is called the government whip. By the way, it was very kind. Someone introduced me as a former deputy leader of the House of Commons. Somebody said that. Yeah, I managed to do it for about seven weeks before they sacked me. So I've been all my life an independent member of the House of Commons. No, I can't take it because I'm being dinged. Basically, the situation, I read, I read what's on the order paper, and then I vote whichever way I think is fair, even if it means I'm voting with a Labour Party or whatever. Shame on that. Whereas other people, other members, just vote the way they're told. Don't vote the way you're told tonight. Don't wait because it's the right thing to vote against Peter Bow. Do it against Dan Hannon. Because, well, no, not so much you, but me. Do what is right. Read the exam paper. Read the motion and vote against it. You cannot seriously, in all fairness, vote for it. So I urge you to vote against the motion. Thank you so much. Thank you.
