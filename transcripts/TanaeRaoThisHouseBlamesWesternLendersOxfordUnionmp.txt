 Thank you, Mr. President, for inviting me to speak here tonight and giving me a full 24-hour notice to prepare for this debate. You may have noticed that all the real experts are on the other side of the House, which I hope you don't take to imply something about the defensibility of the opposition side. So it's no wonder that they invited me to speak, because when you need someone to argue about something about which they know nothing at all, you call a PPE is. My case tonight is simple. We can't assess the blameworthiness of Western lenders in isolation, but rather we need to ask whether we should prefer them over the feasible alternatives. Because we can go back and forth all night about whether the policies of Western lenders have been suboptimal so far, but if the proposition cannot explain why the counterfactual world, the world without Western lenders is a better one, they lose. And the question you need to ask them, the question they've been avoiding all night, is what is the alternative to Western lenders. Because if I'm a distressed developing economy in a world without Western lenders, where do I go? Why is that a better option? That's the question I'm going to answer today. I'm going to explain to you why Western lenders are better than those alternatives. And I think there are two clear alternatives. Either developing countries might not have any foreign lending at all, or they turn to non-Western foreign lenders such as China. And after making some clarifications about the opposition's burden in this debate, I'm going to go through each of these alternatives one by one. I'm going to try and explain why they're worse than distressed developing countries than what for Western lending. I agree with Ahmed that the charitable interpretation of this motion is that Western lenders have caused a net harm to developing countries. That is to say that developing countries are worse off as a result of Western lending than they would have been without that Western lending. And I think that is a position that the proposition is most reasonably tasked with defendant. So very simply, if Western lenders left countries worse off than they would have been without them, we can blame them for their plight. And if they left the developing world in a better position than we don't blame them. Simple. And note that acknowledging the flaws in the current system doesn't imply that Western lenders haven't been a net good to economic development. So we can support reforms like the last speaker mentioned of preventing individual lenders from blocking debt relief, as has been supported recently by the managing director of the IMF. We don't have to prove that Western lenders are perfect because they're not, but merely that are better than the alternatives. Okay, let's start with alternative number one. The first possible alternative to Western lending is no foreign lending at all. And this is a complete non-option because it leaves the governments of developing countries highly constrained in the investments that they can make and the support they can provide for their population. There are broadly three factors which make foreign debt critical for many developing countries. Sorry, I'm tired. It's the last speech. We want to go home. First, they lack domestic financiers and kinds of well-established financial sectors that exist in these wealthy nations. Second, there are severe problems in collecting sufficient taxes, both because households make very little income on average, and also because of corruption-related logistical issues, things like illegible territories, et cetera. And third, I think there's hangover in many cases from bankruptcies of past administrations, which leaves nations, treasuries, empty, and domestic investors deterred. So you can't fund most government programs without foreign lending in most of these states. And these government services are critical for their population, right? They're things like subsidized health care, like public education. These things have allowed countries to build important infrastructure, ports and dams. And very importantly, it has eased the effects of financial crisis experienced by the average household within these nations. So Sri Lanka, for example, has recently entered a severe financial crisis caused by a combination of COVID-19, inane government policies like the banning of fertilizer imports. They're now bankrupt, they're probably going to require IMF assistance. I'm glad to live in a world in which they're likely to get that assistance, because without such concessionary finance, there would probably be a prolonged period of austerity. far more intense than what is typically mandated by Western lenders. So they can go on all night about how the IMF is not going to allow them to spend a sufficient deficit. But the reason that they're able to spend in a deficit at all is because you had some kind of foreign lending to allow you to do so. I think that is an important fact to remember when you walk out of the chamber tonight. But we've gone over this at length in the debate so far. I'm happy to move on. I want to talk about why. Because deficit spending is deeply important, developing nations would almost certainly turn to other foreign lenders if the West were no longer willing to help. I'm going to argue that these alternatives, especially China, who we've seen transitioning towards emergency debt relief over the last few years, have all of the problems of Western lenders and more. So I'm going to use Pakistan as an example here, because growing domestic frustrations with the IMF have caused Pakistani politicians to accept emergency aid like debt relief from China. It owes about $30 billion, as you've heard, we are tonight. That's far more than it owes the IMF. It will need to pay back this emergency debt relief. The proposition says that West's, lenders don't offer concessions when needed. They're not nice enough, essentially. But other lenders, from the CCP to Japanese banks, are also profit motivated. At best, they're profit motivated. At worst, they're motivated by more kind of, like pernicious factors, things like geopolitical considerations that mean that these countries are even worse off when they were, with like, private bank lending. So Pakistan has essentially changed creditors, but what hasn't changed is the economic reality that there are consequences to not paying back these loans. Beyond this, I'm going to list three reasons for why loading from China is comparatively worse than loaning from the IMF, or indeed from multiple individual private Western lenders. So that argument is going to be robust to no matter how you interpret the somewhat ambiguous motion that we presented with tonight. First, China has displayed a willingness to seize other countries' territory if these loans are not paid off. In Sri Lanka, for example, the international community took notice when China seized the Hanban Thota ports after the local government could not pay off the debt with loans. which that construction was financed, right? So to be clear, I don't think this proves that China is like inevitably going to end up controlling all of Pakistan or any other country's infrastructure. I think that would be quite a logical leap. But I do think there is a non-negligible risk if the debt threat continues to worsen and if alternative lenders continue to have their way when Western lenders are no longer in the picture. In contrast, neither the United States, as the national federal government, nor the IMF, has ever responded to a loan default by seizing foreign territory. And look, I don't care whether you've been enacting harm since 2013 or the 1970s. I just think that having infrastructure seized is harmful, right? So I think in the absence of the West, this happens more often because you have to turn to the alternatives. So the argument isn't like, oh, China is bad to vote for us. The argument is China is comparatively worse. In the world without Western lenders, you turn to China. That is a net harm. I would rather be on our side in which there's a net benefit. I think that's just like how counterfactuals work. Second, I think there's far less transparency about the terms of lending, where investments are being spent, the consequences of default. Partly, because Chinese debt is kept off of government balance sheets and is said is placed on state-owned enterprises, state-owned banks. This makes it harder for domestic voters to scrutinize these deals. It probably makes Israel's research a lot more difficult. I don't know why he's on that side of the debate instead of this one. With the Brennan Woods institutions and bond markets, there's at least like a baseline of transparency, right? These are international bodies. They have to publish some degree of information to their member states, which includes, like, the developing countries in the world, the global funds of investments are legally required to be transparent with those investors. And so there is a baseline of transparency you simply do not get with actors like the CCP. Third, taking a loan from a single actor with obvious geopolitical interests risk undermining countries like Pakistan's foreign policy independence. It means that the average voter in Pakistan or any other country taking an emergency loan from a single multiple, like a single government instead of, say, a multilateral institution, like Bread and Woods institutions, get far less control over how their nation is positioned internationally. Because when you are overly reliant on one country to bail you out of financial crisis over and over again, that country can exert a lot of influence over domestic affairs in a way that does not suit your interest in a way that is unforeseeable to the average voter. Compare that to the Brett and Woods institutions. Obviously, as has been pointed out by the proposition speakers, the mechanisms through which decisions are made in these systems, partially disenfranchise those developing countries. But each country in the IMF at least gets a basic vote regardless of how much they financially contribute, especially since 2016, as quotas and voting shares were shifted more towards developing nations. It is fair for the proposition speakers to criticize this model as privileging wealthier nations, but the alternative for Pakistan, for many other developing countries around the world is the Chinese government or a non-Western private free market lender. They, unlike Western, unlike Western, lenders do not have a vote into CCP, they do not have a vote in like for-profit non-Western banks, they would have you trade off some voting power over creditors with no voting power at all. So that's the missing premise in their case, why this lack of developing world representation in the decisions made by creditors is necessarily improved when you remove the Western lenders that gave them the votes in the first place. So I think you can hate Western lenders in the IMF. You can hate the refusal to allow debt relief. You can hate some of the conditions imposed like structural adjustments. And of course you can hate colonialism and the immense amounts of suffering it has caused, but you can still vote for the opposition tonight, because they needed to defend on their side the crisis insignation caused by an absence of foreign lenders, or they needed to explain while the alternative lenders, like non-Western governments, were preferable. That was their burden. They failed to even attempt to fulfill that burden, and as I've argued in this speech, it is far from obvious that either of the two clearest alternatives would have made developing countries better off than they are today. I think this is the part of the speech where I'm supposed to urge you to oppose, but Given that I've been assigned aside, I think that would be slightly disingenuous. So vote how you like and enjoy your night. Thank you.
