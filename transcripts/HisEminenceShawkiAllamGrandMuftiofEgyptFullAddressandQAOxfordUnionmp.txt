 Thank you. Thank you. In the name, God, I'm a rechman and I'm sadd to be in this place and I'm in the arraqa to Oxford and the name of God most gracious, most merciful, let me start by saying how pleased I am to be at such an historic giant place like Oxford and Oxford Union. Today we're going to address a number of the assyla. It's a question that we'll talk today that's the challenges that we're going to in our world in our modern. Today, allow me to share with you a number of questions. These questions help us understand the enormous challenges we are facing in the modern world. It's a question, the fact that we're talking about him, to be it to him to who I asker the question with what is he's talking about the Islam, as who will he say in the inthus'i, as what will he say in the physics, we're in among a newm we need to to specials in it. So it's a question is a important. The first and the foremost question that we need to raise and find legitimate answer is who can adequately speak on behalf of Islam. Like other sciences and scholarships, we can ask the same question about engineering, who can speak on behalf of engineering or physics and other sorts of sciences. So these questions carry within themselves real importance. I think that the Dene is important in our lives and is a part of the whole. And, amam the tithiads of the Mawasurer, We need to this question, how I'm the other question the other, what is he'll talk about his name of this Dene? As you all know, religion plays a crucial role in our modern life. So the question is, how can we adequately understand the essence of religion. and the essence of religiosity and also who is authorized who can speak on behalf of the religion we're notharm in this time and we're in a a group of a area and in a place of an aryquefort. And I'm, I've got from a a group of Azhar, the Shreif, and that is the age now from the 1,000 so, so we're, we're in a tchassus, amyke, and we're we're can say that this, the, the, the we can give us the answer the real about who will he say to have what I'll say to have and how I'm in a world that respects specialization and scholarship I come from an ancient and historic university it is called Al-Azhar university which has been in operation for more than a thousand years. Like Oxford University, also has been an operation for so many centuries. So these two institutions draw upon themselves expertise and the scholarly depth that help us answer the two questions I pose earlier how can we understand religion and religiosity and how and who can speak in the name of religion? This is the history that's in the fact that it gives me a manhagyia, this manhagia, a great and a reaerousa. Not in the Azzhar, but in the Mouassas'at the Almean the different, from the emceal, the Mastjid or Jami'amuian in Dmitas, and the Carrawean in the Morgh, and the Zetuna in Tunis, and in many places in the world, werest of this menehagea from the time, we can't say that we're We are we're talking about in the Acese of the different in the different which you'll give us this manhadiah that I'll talk about. I'm talking about a particular scholarly methodology that has been passed on from generation to other. This methodology is founded in many centers and seats of learning, other than Al-Azhar of Cairo, we find this methodology in Damascus, in Morocco, also in Tunisia, Zaytuna of Tunisia, and also in Yemen. So these seats of learning, because of their historical scholarship, And cumulative understanding of this methodology help us understand and answer the question that I posed earlier, what is this methodology and who can adequately represent Islam and Muslims? This is the monahagia has it's been taken in these the institutions, and in the special in the Azhar Shreif, from the time, a year-in-after-geal, is a case a matter and a case that's a matter of a matter of then, so it can I say that the the fom the sedeed to the Dien can come from this area the area, the arieca. As I shared with you, this method, methodology has been passed from one generation to another to form a continuous chain of transmission. And this methodology has accomplished fruits like stability and constructive development of the societies. And we can safely say such methodology represents the orthodox authoritative and authentic teaching of religion. This is what we call it in the in the realm of the right in our within the standard of metastal. The other of this manhagy that's intertive that's from a year to another she, in the fact, you, this is the this is a not take tisle, and not to getzied a few of the fackarerate, a from the Quran the other, but it takes the nests as a one, one. And then, if it was taken these nossusus as one, one, it's just to be the of the whole of the deen. This methodology has been forming what is known as a continuous chain of transmission. of teachers from one generation that hands this knowledge to the other generation. The second element of this particular methodology is that this methodology understands faith and religion in a holistic way, not in a truncated way, taking everything from religion as a whole. And in other, there's also the there's also the which is a form that's on the way of the same the meaning of the the world, the form of the aloof of the halitha. All that, it will help ushawit on the the law or the or the Dene in a shape and I'd drive for for that, a example, he came in the Sunna, the Synna thebuei, and this is used to use the group of the extremity, use of the gaiya and he build on the arduhats of this in his in his saying, said, I'm I'm to be to the people. I'mer to to cut to the This, in the fact, it would give an intipa, that the person is that a question is not a not if we have this in his name in his in his life in his in his own, it was it was called in it. The third element of this methodology is that for a religious scholar, he has to do his or her or her homework in understanding the different circumstances circumstances surrounding the sacred text, the different contexts surrounding the sacred text. And let me give you an example that has been used by extremist terror groups. A prophetic statement that was narrated from the Prophet, that he said I was commanded to fight the people. So the terror groups use this prophetic statement in a horrible way out of its context, which his eminence is going to explain. The fomest right to us, that we're not to fom this halis in the context of the zarf of zamani his own he has he asked for his and he's said that he waser to fight the people in his and in his who are not all the people. So the correct authoritative understanding of this prophetic statement meant that the prophet himself was commanded to defend his territory from aggression against a particular a particular people that his eminence is going to speak about, the Kymnese. So, so the people in the language of Arab, and that's important in the fathom of the I'm going to, we're going to the language of Arab. The people here are the the Mawoodine, the Mareuthian, who are the Lord of the Sallululah, and not all the people. So the word in the prophetic statement, the people does not refer to refer to the general people in Arabic language, the prefix AL, Al Nass, refers to a particular people who lived in a particular historical period, which refers to the aggressors who attacked the prophet at that time. If we have this Nass or this Dene on this the meaning, we'll we'll end up to a result of which is that the Dene is a part of the HAD, and it's in the human and in the interests. If we're we're not a question, it's a question, this is a fact, this the fact, will be a mowling to the HADM and will be a harm on the people. And, So, I can't say in a period that the that the inter-theid and the the talk of the unflathe, is a chadim of the human, and not against the human. So this was just an example that I explained to you to let you know that how important it is to understand the context of the sacred text. sacred text and not to take the sacred text at the face value. So if we understand faith and faith traditions, in this way, we can safely say that, yes, religion is part of the solution, that religion aims at achieving the best interest of humanity. Otherwise, if we take the sacred text out of their context, religion can be an instrument of destruction and an instrument of terror. And as we're end up to these medeuvre, we're nothered by that all the allum material, There is a difference between the of the field and the and the phozyia and the chemistry and the chemistry and the silhou and the philosophy all these all these the law is a realom in the fact to the nature. We're just we're just of the whole and that he's a time of his life of human. Therefore we ought to understand that religion is in service of humanity. And we ought to understand that sciences and the scholarships complement each other. Religion, religious sciences are important, so are the secular sciences. And both of them complement each other. There is a perspective that we need to understand that all sciences, are integrating with other sciences. Let me give me an example of this the commal in the alom, in a person of the philosopher, the big, Ibn, E. Muhammad, Ibn, E. E. Muhammad, I. He is a demarthe, between the medicine, and the phleg, and the philosophy, and the fuk, and the and in his own, all the all of the whole of the meaning that the chasus with the respect to it, it's to be the one one one of the one of the example of how sciences integrate and complement each other is the famous Averos, the scholar from from Andalusia, who excelled in many sciences, like medicine, astronomy, Islamic jurisprudence, and law, and judiciary as well. So he is an example of an encyclopedic person in many sciences because he believed in the complementarity and integration of sciences. I'm in the in the final I ask or I ask myself the question and I ask the people of all this question what the is the way that we if we'd have we'd have had this manhagey I think that there's a lot in our between us on this manhagia the same that's to the of the human, in that the group of irhabilia that this the fact of and it's behind to and that this is a war in a war that in the of the not the war, not the Arab and the Muslims, are the one the one of the group of this dine, and that's about it was brought by it on the manhagia the of our our own our our own our conclusion I wonder myself and also I'm posing this question to the audience what if we steer away from this holistic, moderate methodology of understanding and applying religion. To me, the answer would be the discourse, the religious discourse, will be hijacked by a minority of people who will wreak havoc and spread corruption on earth and wage wars on everybody to accomplish their political interests. And this corruption will not be confined to a particular geographical area, rather it will be everywhere, including Europe as well. So we have to work together to spread this moderate, holistic understanding and methodology in order to avert destruction and corruption. I know that I've gotled to a and I've gotled to but I'll take the magal to the language of the dialogue, inshua, inshall. Sorry for taking so much time and I will conclude by this and I will open the floor for questions and answers. Thank you for your patience. Thank you very much, Your Remenance, for those very kind, a very interesting words. Sorry, I'll just wait for there. And thank you for excellent translations. Thank you. So, Your eminence. Let's start at the beginning of your journey, I suppose, being born and raised in the Nile Delta. When did you realize that you wanted to be a cleric and a religious scholar? I'm sure. I'm going to be in a community of the community of the community. This is a question is important. I'm a little bit of the Daling Dieny and I'm a small to the gaiya. I was going to have I've got to the Quran the Kareem 11th of and I've gothawr ashr ashr ashr ashrieff in this time, until I'm from the Jambia in the year of 84 and I've got on the doctorate in the law of genuany in the Sharia the Islamia in the same hundred and sixty-and-six and I'm a stazzo's in the in the Jambia of the Jambiazhar Sharia. And I've taken a monceb Mufty of the Jumhorite MISR-A-Rabia since 2013, until now. Thank you for the question. When I was a bit old, I discovered my religious leaning and interest. The first step was that, was that I committed the entire Quran into memory when I was 11, which is, by the way, a very genius way of doing that. So then I joined the Al-Azhar Seminary, and I graduated with a BA in Islamic law in 84. in 84 and then my interest grows and I pursued my grad studies and I was able to finish my PhD in 96. I became a professor of Islamic law at Al-Azhar University, the prestigious Al-Azhar University. I was elected to be the Grand Mufti of Egypt who is the second highest religious cleric in the country. As I was just mentioned you were elected by scholars and you were the first Grand Mufti to be elected rather than appointed by the president. What brought about this change to the appointment of the Grand Mufti and what consequences has it had? The Mufthi, the Mufthi, on all of all of course, is a very, the Mugner of course of all of you, the author of all of it. The fact, in the history of Mast, is from the alamalmah of Azhar Shreif. And the alia, so on the time, in the time, The Ullia, it's in every the lawlain the barrens in the Azhar Shreif and that's a matter of this mansep. There's no a difference of this way or this way, because I'm in a macket-a-islemmy and not just a mouard to choose an intikov to a person that could not be in the mhness and in his, in his, in his knowledge, he is the most of the most of the Mouftees throughout the history of Egypt's Daril Iftaq have been senior scholars of Al-Azhar University. The instrument changed with me, but it is not based on contesting the election or the competition among us, the criteria is purely scholarly, who is more efficient and who is more knowledgeable about this particular field of knowledge. This is the underlying route for the selection. So the tool did not have much repercussions or effect. Rather, all of them, the past Grand Muftis, were as efficient and all of them contributed to the scholarship of the post of the Grand Mufti. In your opening remarks, Your Eminence, you spoke about who has or should have the authority to speak on matters concerning Islam and Muslims. What authority do you see the role of Grand Mufti having within Islam outside of Egypt? And do you liaise much with leaders of the Islamic world outside of Egypt? What is it? I'm not sure you on the question of the book for the question of the media to make it in the matter of this question? We'll just ask for the question and it is, in fact, of the fact, that it's a let's just to not to leave it in a of the other one of the marrable, but it's sire in every time, to get up the thing that's a thing that with the interests of the people. Without a sure, that the is important, and so we in 2015, in 15 December 2015, we've been we've made the the Amman of the Allmahmah to the Uffat in the world. And this amannah, now, 80 Mufty, on the mostowah the world. We can't say that from through the the an between us, we're we'll send a a quatheal, a talk with the of the whole of all the so the time. The time is before this, and now it's a I think what I have made up to make I have raised this question who can adequately represent Islam and Muslims. I think I purposely raised this question so that it will trigger a healthy debate among us because I think it is a very crucial question that will hopefully achieve a correct and authoritative understanding of the faith, something that we all need to grasp at this critical juncture. I yield the spiritual authority outside of Egypt because, as you know, Egypt is the seat of learning to all Muslims all over the world. As his eminence referred to shortly that Al-Azhar is more than a thousand years old. So the Grand Mufti of Egypt and the Grand Mufti of Al-Azhar, of course, whenever he goes to different countries, of course he yields spiritual authority. In terms of leasing with other religious scholars, let me share with you that December 15, 2015, we established an umbrella organization for Fatwa authorities worldwide. And I'm happy to say that it is the only and the largest umbrella organization for Grand Muftis all over the world. We have 80 Grand Muftis cooperating and coordinating with each other so that we could liaise with each other to unify our religious discourse and also to debunk and defeat the radical discourse. Has Your Excellency engaged in the religious discourse? Your Excells engaged in dialogue with any Shia clerics, particularly those in Iran. I'm, without a shak, that we've learned in the Azzarer, and in this manhadiah, that I said, and in the foresnail the word, that the fom of the, is a single, it makes you an unfeathean on the whole, it's just a certain of this or this is a part, but it's a need to have to to actually to understand the whole and it'stufed with what it's theathe in any way from the amazement. And so we're in aetor the form of the nass not we don't know a fruquean many from what we're into in the deferser the time as it, and that's a lot of the words of the alimmy. And as it's a lot of the matter of the fact that you see a huge, so, if you see, there's a chivalafing as I pointed in my opening remarks, I am a product of Al-Azhar and we have been taught at this historical seminary that Islam is an open paradigm. that Islam seeks to engage with people from the same faith or across other faith traditions. This is the proper understanding that we have been taught and we also practice. So we are open to engage with dialogue within followers of the same faith or across faiths, so long as these initiatives of dialogue, you know, restrict themselves to the confines of decent understanding of religion and steer away from political motivation. So we are for scholarly dialogue among people of other faiths. among followers of the same faiths. Thank you very much. I am conscious I want to open up to questions from the audience. I'll have two more questions from me, one on Egypt and its political situation and one on the fatwa apps that you have launched. Firstly, it's been now over a decade since the Arab Spring and the removal of Mubarak as the leader of Egypt. How do you think that the country has changed in the last decade? last decade. Without a much the matter of much a big change a because because to take forward in a much much and a very mhawar. The first is the building the area the and that's important to to get to the next the main the main of the MISRI and it'sqiv and this a of the things from the Mhwar the Shihah, Mhwar the Alim There also the the idea of for the community of the topacques the poor and that's in the five years in the year of the year of Seasie. It was a biger very from the through the a new a matter of and it got in the of the mrs. So, so we're in a muchhid the same the present in many muchooooes and Maybe shehade me's a majorouche, but who who is that, who is the fact that we're in a lot of a great result. Of course, I'm a bit biased to Egypt being my country. And I think overall the ending result of this decade, Of course, the first few years have been tough and difficult for Egyptians, but the ending result, especially the last few years, we see Egypt is progressing at a marvelous rate. Everybody, even the people walking in the street, are feeling this. There has been so many development in terms of infrastructure, roads and better services being offered to everybody. Also on the front of caring for the human being, there has been so many initiatives, including health initiatives, education, and also societal protection initiatives, initiatives and let me just share with you that there has been an initiative called Decent Life which is giving care and social care and also other important care for more than 60 million Egyptians which is roughly 50 60% of the population so Overall, we feel qualitative change in Egypt, and we hope that this continues in the future. Thank you very much. And finally from me, two days ago in the Palace of Westminster in London, you announced the launch of the Fatwa Pro mobile app dedicated to Muslims in the West to help provide all fatwas of interest and answer questions within Islamic societies. described it as a moderate, permanent and available Mufti at any time for Muslims in the West. This bridging of technology and religious teaching is very progressive, very innovative. What's the story behind it? How did it come to be? And what are you hopeful for? Thank you. The fact, the fact we're in the Darl Fetal, the world of the Fetrean-Masry, we're using the technology the modern in the human, and for that we're using it in the country, in the Arabian, is an use of course of Europe, using a great, but it's a to be more, and we're also in the lullagued in 12 languages from the Islamisle of the Islamis in in Europe, and in America, and in Australia, and it's shatted the world that that's not to call in the Loughatheal of Arabic. We'll talk about 12 languages, but it's in the fact that we're using a new The language of how nice in the applications, and I think we've got a lot, and we've done the and we've got to that the application that's the use the user the unconfettish, is the, the, it's a type on the, uh, thehawattva pro. Uh, so I'll know the, aught of pro. And I'd, I'd like, or I'd think, that the wasatia is the because the answer and the answer of the different and the system will be a lot of the one, the matter the one, and it's the moreaes of the social to all the community of the other, mureat, the maraud of the third, the moraeat the fahmique to the nonsuels the shirreary which has been the one on the our slydna our sallel by this the three of the estuarial the and the russus and the idea, we can't say we can say that we can't we'll souddr the and that's the the talk the shawed to the nussus shirreary as we we're we're all and we're we're going to we're we're going to the very happy that you raised this question and this important initiative that we recently launched as a matter of fact since I headed and presided over Egypt's Daril Ifta we prioritized the use of technology and the use of the electronic space to reach out, especially to young people who are glued to their smartphones most of the time. So we wanted to reach out to them. So we started with electronic websites at that time, and then later on it developed into state-of-the-art Facebook fan pages, and also Twitter, and later on Instagram, and the last one was TikTok. So we started with our Arabic Facebook fan page, which has more than 11 million subscribers. And it has been an organic development and number. And then later on, we said that our discourse should not be local. So we expanded on other languages as well, European languages, Eastern languages. So we developed 12 languages so far. And basically we thought of reaching out to the Muslim communities in Europe, in Australia, in French-speaking countries as well, to have a platform or an electronic application so that they can reach out to us and ask questions, religious questions. And we have a particular methodology. Number one, we respect the context of the concerns of these Muslims, whatever they happen to be. So we do not, for example, a typical question that comes from Egypt should not necessarily be the answer that we give to someone who lives in UK or Germany or Australia. So we respect the context of Muslims. Also, we aim at equipping Muslims to be good citizens of the countries they happen to live in and to be instruments of stability for their societies, not instruments of havoc and destruction. And also our fatwas, they follow strict methodology of understanding the religious texts that I shared with you earlier how to understand the religious text in a nuanced modern way. And this Fatwa app, Fatwa Pro, aims of course to reach out to Muslims everywhere, the people who use smartphones, as well as also, it aims at marginalizing the radical discourse so that we could present the better alternative for our fellow Muslims. Thank you very much. Thank you to answer all my questions. Thank you. I now look to members present for any questions, suggestions that they may have. Please raise your hand in the air and one of our team will come and bring you a microphone. Please stand up and speak into the microphone with any questions. If you have any questions, please raise your hands now and they'll be translated for His Eminence. the member in the blue shirt. Do you have any ideas on the next project that you'll be working on after this app? Is there anything else lined up in the future? And as a man is a lot of you have to think a lot of and to beaqqaq and to be in the future of the and what you need the insan and so we're in the Duthorasasat Musrii an Mertka, a center, a center of this is a Makhassie Mue and he's on a of a work with a RACCELMENT, the world, we're going to be the world, we're going to be a meeting in seven, six, the next, the we're going to be that these the the ways that's the talk about this is the mostiast that's going to comeo'a the Let me assure you that we are too ambitious at Egypt's Daril Ifta and almost every day we have innovative and creative ideas so that we could help Muslims and reach out to them especially, you know, they have so many questions in their questions in their mind so we would like to reach out to them in a creative innovative way and and this is basically our mission on this earth is to try as much as we can to serve others until until we die I would I would just say that recently also we also we put together an It's called Salam Center for Countering Extremism Studies, which is the first of its kind think tank to coordinate the work among specialists in this field to get together and to think of ways to debunk and correct inaccuracies and radical ideas. So when I fly back to Egypt, it will be very busy in putting together the first international conference. It will be in June, early June, 7th to 9th June, more than 50 countries will take part in this important conference. And I really hope that the recommendations and the conclusions and the conclusion the concluding statement of this conference will help us to achieve world peace and also to liaise with other people so that they will be working on the common agenda of peace building and bridge building. Thank you very much. I look for another question, the member in the green shirt. It is clear that in the West in this century we are becoming more secular. Do you think in Egypt that Egypt will become more secular this century or do you think religion will remain very important to the daily lives of Muslims in Egypt? And in Egypt, by its nature, with its its, and with its its and its'n its long, and with its' it's all its long, it's, it's to be it all the whole of the whole of the societies. and istafad it from the and aphalate the and aphalra the insania not today but from the time. So, it's the age of the culture in it to get to seven thousand years before this time. This is the history of in the fact it gives us a matter that we can understand the of the fathar in the in the itar also for mehom for the Dinn's right in the nature of the Christian with our estifidates. And so, in Islam, the word is the chkma is the dulled the moumin, where what is it, for what is it, so as a fqar that will come to us to us a good to feed us in the in the we're not manna'an to we're not able to in the itar of our our right in our human that's Egypt has to me a particular nature it's a great country with an ancient civilization that that dates back more than 7,000 years. And throughout its history, it has been a melting part for ideas and engagement with other civilizations and cultures and people. So Romans came to us and Persians and many other Arabs, many other different people came to us with their ideas. And as you know also, Great Britain came to us, and France came to us. So his eminence is saying that it has been a melting pot and nothing or no civilization or no people forced their ideas on the Egyptian people. Rather, they retain. they retained their moderate religiosity and understanding of the faith. But at the same time, they were open to engage with other people. So they retained their particular identity, so to speak, but they engaged with other people. So it will remain the case that any idea or any idea, culture or any civilization. When it comes to Egypt, people do not accept it at the face value. Rather, they engage with it, but at the same time, they retain their identity, so to speak. Thank you very much. I'm afraid we only have time for one more quick question. That's from me, and it's a question we ask all of our speakers at the end of their addresses. If what advice would you in two or three sentences give to the members of the Oxford Union and the students of Oxford University? Your Honor, Your Honor. I think it's a lot of the students of Oxford University, a level high we're to continue the and the research the real which is the the world and it's a lot of the Gamsuford is the the university the I mean the and the mowgrey to this will be the the research and the research of the university. I think the students at Oxford are first-class students everybody envy you. And from the bottom of my heart, I wish all of you that you excel both in your education and in life, and that you take this education as a tool to serve humanity. This is extremely important because education in itself without rendering services to humanity is not adequate. So I urge each one of you to serve humanity when you are studying as well as when you graduate and also to serve your great nation, the United Kingdom. This should be a part of your goal. And one day I wish to be at Okon Oxford, you know, this great historic place. And I wish that our engagement continues. And I wish that I come back soon to this great place. Ladies gentlemen, please join me in thanking his eminence. Thank you.
