 Thank you, Mr. President, for giving me the opportunity to speak in what promises to be a highly memorable debate for the Oxford Union in its bicentenary year. I feel immensely privileged to have been able to work on delivering such a strong term card with a fellow Scott at the helm and one who actually knows how to reel, unlike myself. As I'm sure we are all aware, this Tuesday marked Valentine's Day. This year, I spent my evening with my newfound and blossoming love, the Oxford Union. For my sins, I found myself... For my sins, I found myself in the Union Bar, drinking my woes away with a dram and bemoaning my lack of a Scottish accent. Tonight, I would like to remind members of the long-standing love present in another union between Scotland and the rest of the nations that make up the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Now, I'm not so naive as to paint a picture through rose-tinted glasses of a fairy tale romance between Scotland and England. I'm certain any couple who have enjoyed a long-standing marriage will readily tell you it is not without its problems. but that when times are tough, the answer one hopes, should never come to splitting ways. Scotland and the rest of the home nations in their matrimony have of course endured a afraid relationship with tensions over the usual issues, money, autonomy and freedom, to name a few, but the solution to these problems should not be to break away and give up on the marriage. No, it should be to solve the problem in a way that is mutually beneficial. remembering the love that has bound us in this union for over 250 years, and the capacity for that love to evolve. Tonight, I would like to bring to our members' attention three issues the people of Scotland are facing today. The public health crisis, a failing education system, and the depleting natural resources in the North Sea. Let me make clear, if Scotland were to become independent, these issues would only be exacerbated, not solved. But first, before I get too carried away with myself, it is my privilege to introduce the speakers in proposition of the motion this evening. You have already heard a fine speech from Oliver Crawford, a first-year classicist at Balliol College and a guest liaison officer here at the Oxford Union, which basically means he has the cushions job on committee. Oliver is a fine choice to speak on the motion tonight, Mr. President. He is half Sri Lankan and has a great deal of national pride for the country. He even has a Sri Lankan flag hanging in his room in Balliol. The only problem is that it took him a whole term to realize he had hung it back to front. Next, you shall hear from Mrs. Tasmania Ahmed Sheikh, a former member of Parliament for Ochel and South Perfshire and Scotland's first female Muslim MP. Mrs. Ahmed Sheikh was a member of the Scottish National Party for over two decades before joining Mrs. Salmon's Alba Party. There's a poniency in the fact she began her political career with the Scottish Conservatives before joining the S&P and subsequently losing her seat in the Commons to the Conservatives in the 2017 general election. What goes around comes around. Finally, you shall hear from a man whose reputation precedes him. the right Honourable Alex Salmon, former First Minister of Scotland, former leader of the Scottish National Party, and now the current leader of the recently formed Alba Party. It is an honour to have Mrs. Salmon here with us tonight, but hopefully he can deliver his speech more successfully than he delivered Scottish independence during his time as First Minister. These are your guests, Mr. President, and they are of course most welcome. Public health is a big issue in Scotland. It's no secret we enjoy our food, and therefore it should perhaps come as no surprise that as the nation responsible for the creation of the deep-fried Mars bar, Scotland has the lowest life expectancy of all UK countries. There are huge disparities in life expectancy between the most and least deprived areas of Scotland. Men and women born in the most deprived areas can expect about 24 fewer years of good health than men and women born in the least deprived areas. In the most deprived areas, men and women spend more than a third of their life in poor health. Furthermore, NRS statistics show that drug-related deaths are 18 times more likely, and alcohol-related deaths are four times more likely in Scotland's most deprived areas. But is the solution to break away? To go it alone? Of course not. And Scotland would be worse off for it. Spending is currently 30% higher per person in Scotland compared to England due to the Barnett formula. Yet, Scotland contributes less in tax revenues per person than the UK average. As a result, the gap between spending and revenues in Scotland was 23.45% of GDP in the year 2020 to 2021, compared to 15.24% of the UK GDP. If Scotland were to leave the UK, they would have to deal with the same health crisis, but with far, far less money to solve it. Scotland's National Health Service would suffer. Scotland's National Health Service would suffer, and so would its citizens. The only way forward for Scotland is to remain in the Union, to take advantage of the financial benefits it provides, and to reform its health policy to tackle these issues effectively. Similarly, Scotland's education system is failing its students. PISA, the publication for international student assessment, which gauges student attainment in countries across the world, found in 2018, that Scotland was suffering from a long-term decline in attainment in key areas such as reading, science, and particularly mathematics. Over the course of almost two decades, Scotland's scores in mathematics and science consistently declined, whilst in England, scores have increased incrementally in mathematics and reading. It is also important when comparing the two countries to consider the socio-economic attainment gap in England and Scotland respectively. The gap has closed in both countries. However, in England, this has come about by boosting the attainment of those from a lower socioeconomic background, despite those of a higher socioeconomic background, also improving attainment. Whereas in Scotland, it has come about by a drop in attainment from students of a higher socioeconomic background and a small improvement from those of a lower socioeconomic background. ground. These problems have only been aggravated after cuts made to education in Scotland in recent years, and subsequent growing class sizes and limited subjects. Furthermore, Scotland's curriculum for excellence has proved itself to deliver anything but. Let me ask you this. How did an independent Scottish government go about solving these problems with even less money and the same inadequate leaders at the top? The answer is self-evident. The Scottish education system is already failing its students, but an independent Scotland would disadvantage them even further. Now, not only would Scotland have to deal with these issues without the support of Westminster, but they would have to deal with finding new markets to trade in and a blow in their trade with England. 60% of Scotland exports are to the rest of the UK, with just 20% going to EU countries. The proposition will tell you Scotland will be able to rejoin the EU if they leave the UK, and will therefore benefit in the long run financially. But what about the here and now? What about the people of Scotland, who will no doubt have to suffer through years of austerity in an inadequately funded state before the EU will accept them? Once again, it is surely clear the way forward for Scotland is not to endure the messy breakup, but to work together with Westminster and with the Welsh Senate and the Assembly in Northern Ireland to solve these problems together. There's one last point I would like to raise tonight. And to do so, I'd like to take you all to a wind-swept rock in the middle of the North Sea that I call home, the Shetland Islands. People often ask me what Shetland is known for, to which I reply, good nitware, myself and the oil industry. When oil and gas were discovered off the coast of Shetland in 1971, it revolutionised the British economy and brought Shetland a huge amount of wealth. And as a result, we now have an obscene amount of public swimming pools. But the thing is, the oil and gas is running out. yet Scotland is still hugely reliant on it and would continue to be dependent on it if it were to leave the UK. The people in Shetland recognise this and as a result are staunch liberal Democrats. It would be quite a sight to behold, though wouldn't it? The hypocrisy of a nation hosting a global climate conference just two years ago, then having to rely on and indeed ramp up the production of oil and gas industries to support itself. but it needn't be the case Scotland can remain financially stable whilst transitioning away from oil and gas to new sources of green renewable energy but only if they remain a part of the Union with such a budget deficit and reduction to public spending it would simply be infeasible for an independent Scotland to invest adequately in renewable energies whilst oil reserves drop lower and lower once again the choice is clear we're better together To conclude, I'd like to remind you here tonight of the words of John Don. No man is an island entire of itself. And indeed, those sat opposite me tonight will do well to remember these sentiments. Scotland is not an island. Whether they like it or not, we have shared, currently share, and will always share these British Isles. Increasingly, some of us Scots may fear that those we share this island with treat it more and more as exactly that. But let us not respond to this introversion with equally narrow-minded nationalism, but on a smaller scale. The problems each home nation faces are not to be solved by divorcing our union and by giving up, but by reforming policy, by working together and by remaining as one united kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Our nation's constitution has brought about over 250 years of peace. And this level of stability is not to be underestimated. Robbie Burns said that he looked upon the British Constitution to be the most glorious on earth or that perhaps the wit of man can frame. The words of Scotland's greatest poet ring true today just as clearly as they did when he wrote them. If you value our four home nations, if you truly want the best for Scotland and her people. If you believe that unity is the way forward and not separation and isolation, then I urge you all tonight to vote for the opposition and to vote for a united kingdom. Thank you.
