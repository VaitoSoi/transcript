 Good evening, everyone. It's lovely to see you here. Rebecca Black is an American singer and YouTube personality, who gained fame in 2011 with the release of her single Friday. The song went viral on YouTube, reaching over 160 million views. Her songs, covers, and collaborations have earned her over 1.5 million subscribers. Her latest EP, Rebecca Black, was here, was released in 2021, and earlier this week, Rebecca has released her first full-length album, Let Her Burn. Please join me in welcoming Rebecca Black. My gosh, I'm way too prepared. Brought many beverages. You can never go wrong. Welcome, Rebecca. It's lovely to have you here. Thanks for having me. And especially as you've just wrapped up your UK and Ireland tour. Can you tell us a bit about that? How is that going? Or how is that going? It was so much fun. I mean, I have to say as somebody who is just kind of at the beginning of my touring career and I was able to come here in May and play my first shows, and then, you know, visit a few more city. It's just, it's so incredible to be so far away from home, but feel so supported and to see people really connecting to, especially, you know, what I've been doing recently. And, yeah, it's just, I feel so special that every, I feel so grateful that, like, every night, the energy in the room, even though half the tour I was playing an album that wasn't even out was just so good, so warm. is so special. Amazing. And you mentioned your album that's just come out now. It's come out 12 years after you were first kind of in the spotlight. So what has what has the process been like putting that together? What was the inspiration behind it? I mean it's been something that's been in the making for 12 years in one regard in the sense that like ever ever since my start as unintentional as it was once that happened, I had never felt more out of control in my own life. I mean, I was a 13-year-old, so, like, I was the epitome of out of control, obviously. But I just so desperately, I think, for so long, felt like I had been robbed of this experience of being able to show the world who I was on my own terms. And that obviously came with a lot of pain, that came with a lot of shame with what I went through. And I don't know if I knew it at the time, but like the most important process for me over the past 12 years has been, one, obviously growing into just any version of the person that I was going to become, because that doesn't exist when you're a kid. You have no idea who you are or what you're going to be. But yeah, just again, like being able to define myself on my own terms and understand what I had to say. And I mean, we can talk about the inspirations of the album in terms of what each song is particularly about. But really, the inspiration behind the album was I needed to, as a person, as an artist, as a creative, understand and find the ability. to know that I had something to offer when the entire world had told me for years and really harped on the fact that, like, I had nothing to offer. And even though I don't know if I'd be able to say that a few years ago or a few months ago or even a few days ago, but, like, I know now that, like, a piece of myself somewhere deep down believed in who I was and believed in what I had to say, and knew that, like, regardless of whether anyone thought it was good, like, as a person, I deserved that, right? And, yeah, I guess that's why I'm here, is because this album is, in so many ways, just the beginning of talking about what I really have to say and showing people who I am, you know? Yeah. I just wanted to go right back to the very beginning before the tour, and before kind of everything, because you were obviously very young when Friday came out. Was music something that you'd always wanted to do, or was it something that you just kind of decided to give a go? Well, I was a kid who grew up performing. I mean, I think just like on a whim with my parents trying to give me and my brother things to do, they tried putting my brother in karate lessons and tried putting me in a dance class to see if hopefully that gave us some, version of a hobby and I fell in love with performing and I spent the entirety of my childhood in different performance groups, dancing, in theater. I was like a huge musical theater kid. And that was just like where I found a first version of like freedom and identity. So yeah, I was always doing it. And for me like Friday was just like one of those things that I stumbled on an idea, talked about it to my parents thinking that, or to my mom, thinking that, like, she would never agree to doing it. And then, you know, I got the opportunity to do it as kind of like a, let's see if this could go on a resume one day as, like, experience, you know, for whatever I want to do. At that point, like, was by no means trying to become a pop star at 13. It was just kind of like, this is something that puts you in a studio. or like gets you the opportunity to see a side of this that you're still trying to figure out for yourself, you know. Yeah, and was it something that when you kind of saw it come through and when you had made the music video, was it something that you thought was going to go viral? No! Oh my God. I mean, I, even at that point, 10 years ago, like the internet, I was just some kid in California going to middle school, like, living my life. I mean, I remember, and I've talked about this many times, but, like, you know, while that video was, or before the video existed, and even just when I, like, met with the company for the first time, it was kind of like, oh, you never know. Sometimes, like, you know, if it goes online, it can get views and become a thing, but, like, I was like, absolutely not. There's just no way that's going to happen to me. So it was really just an experiential, again, like, resume building. thing of maybe one day when I start to apply to college, I can talk about the experiences that I had as like random as that particular choice was. And how did the rap from Friday come about? Because that's something that's often talked about. The rap bit. The rap verse. It didn't exist until like the day of the video they showed up and were like, there's a rap verse in it. I mean, I don't think people realize, like, truly how, and we were talking about this just before we came on stage, like, how much of a bystander I was in that situation. Like, I was, I had no creative decision-making or control over that thing. Like, I was literally just showing up. You know, they sent me the song. I felt bad, like, I didn't want to ask for another song because what right do I have to, like, be that picky about this thing that's just kind of going to, existed in my own world and you know the video kind of came about like I was just there to do it and have the experience and all of that yeah and um since then obviously you've released so much more music and YouTube content as well do you kind of get sick of people calling you like the Friday girl or associating you with that or is it something that you kind of think of as something that helped get you to where you are now but now you have more to offer I mean, on one hand, I obviously, I think one of the most important things for me to come to terms with over the past 12 years has been that, like, I, on one hand, will never be able to control what everybody thinks about me. And if I do spend the rest of my life trying to do that, I'll rob myself of like a lot of freedom and opportunity to think about other things. But at the same time, like, of course it's frustrating because that was one tiny moment of my life when I wasn't even who I am now. I mean, imagine if like every person in this room was known by like one day in their life from when they were a 13 year old. like we would have really complex relationships with each other and ourselves. And there's just so much more to who all of us are, you know, that exists way down the line. I mean, right now, like, that was half my life ago. But hopefully I'll live a lot longer than I do now. And that will become, like, a very, you know, small, early days version of myself. And also, like, I think the idea of defining people, by one thing that's happened to them and defining people by something that happened to them as a child is just like such a disservice to like who we are as people and the capabilities that we have. So of course, like, I'm not the Friday girl. I've lived so much longer than that. But at the same time, I know that people will always see me as that. And I think that's a shame for them because if they took a second to, you know, you know, look past that I think maybe they could see something that's a way more interesting story than just what Friday was, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. And throughout the years, you've been very open on your YouTube channel and appearances on the Tonight Show about mental health and the impact that a lot of the, like, internet trolling and cyberbullying has had on you as a teenager. How did you deal with that at such a young age? I mean, I did the best that I could. Like, there's not, unfortunately, and even still, I mean, we watch kids go viral every day. And like the resources that exist for young kids, specifically in that experience, in that experience, it's kind of impossible to guide somebody through that because it's such a strange phenomenon. And also, the internet is changing so much every day. So the ways that people go viral and deal with that is different for everybody. But I mean, I think back then, like, all I could do was cope with it. And for me, as a child, you know, I've talked about how, like, being that young, you have no sense of self. It completely, you know, warps your perception of reality because everybody who's older than you, you assume to be smarter than you, because that's kind of how we're taught to be, or at least how I was taught to be, when I was that young. your elders guide you. So when the world full of adults told me that I was an idiot, told me that I was ugly, told me that I was stupid, told me that I was talentless, told me that I had literally no worth as a person, like there's nowhere else for that to go other than straight into your reality, right? But as I grew up, I mean, the only person that was going to do that was going to do that guide myself through it was myself and I felt really lucky to be able to work with some people and professionals even that really helped me guide myself through that healing because I I would have never been able to be here in this moment if it weren't for the work I had to do on myself. And what do you think are kind of like some of the cultural changes that we can make to protect like other young teens like yourself who are put into the positions? That's a big good question. And I wish I had the answer. But I mean, I think really it all starts with the way that each and every one of us interact with something online. And it's funny, the thing that I've gotten the most in terms of like people kind of talking to me about how their feelings have changed about me or you know that experience over the past few years as so many people have said to me like I didn't even realize that you were 13 I didn't realize that you were a person that was real I didn't really realize that like you would see what I was saying but it's like we all use the internet in the same way whether or not I was 13 or 18 or 25 like every single one of these people on the internet reads and watches in the same way. And it's trying to find the version of themselves on the internet and be, you know, accepted. So the way that we interact with that, every single one of us, like, whether it's liking something or commenting something, you know, mean, but it's funny, you know, all of those things are equally as meaningful. And also, like, sticking up and showing support for people is equally as meaningful. And sometimes I think, like, no matter how, like, mean a joke is, like, slides by because it's funny, like, is that really worth it? You know, it doesn't mean that criticism can't exist, but, like, I guess it's at what cost? Are we all willing to, you know, do something because it's right? Yeah, and then in 2016, you started releasing a lot more new music, like The Great Divide, followed by Foolish. And firstly, what was the kind of inspiration behind those? And secondly, how did you deal with going from the backlash of Friday into becoming a different artist and releasing a lot more serious music? Yeah, I mean, that specific period of my life, like, I was just learning. I had to go, I mean, I had this thing happen to me as a kid. I like went to high school, finished it up, graduated, convinced my parents that like, I'm going to go try and do this for myself and learn and find my way into rooms with songwriters, with producers, with anybody who would work with me just because so many people wouldn't give me the time a day at that point. And those songs were just, like, I think the first, you know, versions of myself on paper of, like, trying to figure out how to make something that was somewhat resonant of me, but, like, I was still only, like, 18, 17 when I wrote those songs. So, you know, even now, like, as a 25-year-old, it feels like it's been so much time since that, and that was still, like, such an early version of who I was as an artist. And, I mean, I'm still in an early version of who it was. who I am now. But yeah, I think it was just trying to kind of figure that out and learn. I was trying to take every session as like an opportunity to be taking in like, how does this process really work? Because my original experience was nothing like the industry worked. It was like kind of like, here's a song, here's a video, bye, you know, that's not, that's not creativity, really. So yeah, I mean, I think that what I make now and even the time since those first kind of releases was so important to just learn and also learn how to make my own choices and speak my own choices because my biggest issue as an artist when I decided I really wanted to do this was okay I've decided I want to do this but like I'm so stuck in my own shame that like I can barely even speak in these rooms and I feel like I shouldn't be here and I feel like everyone that's in these rooms with me doesn't want to be here with me because why would they want to be here with me? Because I've had this big kick-me sign on my back for the rest of what feels like my whole life. And I had to grow through that and push through that. And so Rebecca Black was here. That was the first project that I was like, okay, I'm on to something. Like I'm figuring out how to lead through my creative influences and really put who I am into these songs just a bit more. and then, you know, let her burn the album that just came out, that process started while Rebecca Black was here was happening, and that was really empowering to really, really lead something through who I am now. And do you have one song or one song lyric that you're most proud of that means the most to you? Oh, wow. It's a difficult question. It's a difficult question. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it changes all the time. And I think it's been really cool and really special to see the way that people interact with different songs because I have different ideas of, you know, what I think people will love versus what they end up loving. And it's really fun to see people love the songs that were like the bigger risks. Songs like Misery Loves Company and Destroy Me. And even there's a song called Doeite on the project that is, like one of the most insane things I've ever written because it's so sensual and explicit. And like that was really important for me as an artist to be able to find legitimacy in. But I think if I had to pick a song right now, I'm really proud of the song called Performer. And in 2018, you appeared on the American Singing Contest before. And I think that was probably the first time. that a lot of people had seen you since Friday on kind of on the big screen. What was that experience like? It was a scary one. Again, that was like a period of my life where I was really still trying to understand who I was and like find acceptance within myself. And it was an opportunity that came up. and my biggest challenge over the past few years, one of them, has been like finding redemption, not just with other people, but with myself. And when I get an idea to do something, I go for it. So I did that show, and it was so crazy, because that feels like lifetimes ago, but at the same time, that was a really, like, awesome little healing moment for me to walk into a room full of people who probably only knew me from, again, this thing that I've been unfortunately defined by for so much of my life, and give everything that I had. And people were so accepting of it and so supportive. So yeah, I think it was just kind of a small but important step into finding the confidence that I have now. And when you look back through your career and your time, is there one moment that you're most proud of, one kind of highlight that you have? I think this is the highlight. Just this experience of being able to talk about this moment that I'm in and this whole week has been the highlight because finally like whether people like it or not like I'm here I've shown you who I am I've shown you what I have to offer in this moment and like I will only take it further from here and it's so exciting just again like as a person who like finds so much identity through creating and performing I love what I do, and I feel meant to do what I do, and to be able to do that and play it to a room of, like, I was just in London two days ago for my biggest headline show I've ever done, and I played to a thousand people. And like seven years ago, I booked a show in New York and eight people booked tickets. So I had to, or bought tickets, so I had to cancel it. And to see that evolution and see that, like, I guess it's ironic because for so many, years people have been like, I can't believe that you're real and not this weird viral robot. It's like seeing people show up today or show up to that show and see like a thousand people in that room, I can't believe that this is real. And it's so exciting and so encouraging to see people just resonating with, whether it be my story or my music or both, you know, and creating a really good energy in the room. That's the highlight, I think. Yeah, amazing. And when you look back at your journey, is there one person that you feel really indebted to, or one kind of big inspiration for you? I mean, there have been, over the last few years, so many people, and not just over the last few years, It's like over the entirety of these past 12 years, and I could probably go through further than that, who have just stuck their necks out for me, and who gave me the time of day, and I couldn't put that down, I think, to one person. But people who have gone against, I guess, what was cool or popular to do, or maybe the safer thing to do in order to just give me a chance and hear me out and see something, you know, in me that was more than this thing that, again, I've been defined by for a really long time, that being producers, songwriters, the people on my team, you know, people in my family, my friends, like other artists that I've had the opportunity to work with, that's really, I mean, the people that show up in my shows again, that's so meaningful because there was a time in my life where, like, that didn't feel like it existed at all, you know. Who's been the best person you worked with? I could never say that. I don't know if there's a best person. You mean, like, in terms of music or producing? Oh, my God. That's an impossible question to answer. I mean, this album is an amalgamation of a lot of different collaborators and a lot of different producers and writers that I was able to work with all so different and from so many different backgrounds. That it'd be, yeah, impossible to pick. Yeah. And in 2020 on an episode of Dating Straight, the podcast, you came out as queer. What has the reaction to that been like, and what has it been like sharing such a personal part of you with the world? I mean, I feel really lucky to be able to be somebody who can come out in a time where I was met with so much acceptance and so much welcoming. And I've been so great. grateful for that because I'm just very aware of the fact that like that one has not been the case for so long and also there are so many people within my audience who have accepted me who don't get to share that same experience in their own world. So it's been really empowering. I mean I love being able to play a show full of gay people. It's amazing. It's some of the best, you know, energy and there's this, you know, there's this, you know, shared, I think, like thread even outside of my own relationship to the community in terms of like my own sexuality, being a queer person that I've said this before, but so many people in the queer community were there for me and stood up for me before anybody else would because of some thread that they found with me and my story, again, before I even talked about my own, you know, piece of it. And that's never left me. So I just, I have so much respect for everybody in the queer community. And I'm, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and your career has been one that's filled with many, many roller coasters, many challenges that you faced. What would you say has been the biggest challenge and how did you overcome it? I mean, I think that it's this. moment as well, even though it's the highlight. Like, I am here to show people again and convince people who love to define everything on the internet by, like, really simplistic things that, like, I'm here to do this, and here's what I have to offer. And I know that the internet has really high standards, especially for, like, young people, young women, young women in entertainment. And yeah, so I guess it's, that all comes from the ability to even have the confidence to do it. And like, I've never been more ready in my life, but at the same time, like, it's fucking scary, sometimes going up against the internet. And trying to convince people who you're only just like a flick on their phone. right, for two seconds. And if they've already seen you before and decided how they feel about you, it can be really hard to change that. And I felt that, I think, through, like, my own shame for the last 12 years. So getting past that level of fear is probably one of the biggest things. Yeah. And I want to save time for questions because I'm sure a lot of you have them. So yeah, does anyone have any questions for Rebecca? Yes, let's go to the International Officer. Hi. I was just saying before, I know Friday was so long ago, but honestly, I think... Sorry, I was just saying before, I know Friday was so long ago, but I feel like, in a way, it was my hyperpop awakening before that existed. It was like something about it, like clicked in my head. And I feel like when you released that remix with Dorian Electra, it was almost like reclaiming that into who you are now. And I guess my question is given that you, some of the music that you produce is hyperpop, how do you understand that genre? Because to me, it feels like a really expansive kind of genre in the sense that you've got 100 geeks on like one end, but then you've got kind of bubblegum like Slater and even yourself and Dorian Electro, you've got kind of like Glave, which is more like punky and then you've got more chill like Ainon Bonsai. So how do you kind of see yourself in that space? and what does Hyperpop mean to you? And my second question is for the old girl is, where do you get your clothes from? Where did I get my boots from? On the back. Or your clothes from? Just in general, is there like a place that is like really good to find old clothing that you can. Well, that's the exciting stuff to talk about. No, I'm kidding. That's funny. We'll get there. And thank you. How do I understand Hyperpop? I mean, I've had such an interesting relationship with it over the last few years. And I mean, I think that first and foremost, like, I have so much credit to give to the artists in the hyperpop world who were some of the first people to ever give me, you know, like a personal sense of legitimacy. And again, were some of those first people who saw me as more than like, I don't know, some random thing that happened a few years ago. And I've always been really grateful for the sense of community that that gave me. Like people like Dorian specifically were so welcoming and so, I don't know, just like an inspiring person to even know and understand and see somebody kind of rise through their own creativity. but I think that hyperpop, you know, it's interesting to see the world become more familiar with this like super niche part of music and try to commodify it as something that like it's just one of those communities that I think a lot of pieces of greater pop music take inspiration from but don't give credit to in a way to make it like a little bit more like you know commercially marketable. I think that as a community, as like a space of artists, it represents so much of what I hope pop will become in terms of the risks that it takes. You have artists like Gex that like in their music, like are so self-referential to what pop is and could be. And I think that's, I hope to see more of those artists like actually become big pieces of pop and not just have their elements taken from and use in pop, because those are the geniuses that will continue to make music interesting and will continue to make music inspiring and continue to build a legacy of artists that are continually shaping what pop could be. So I think it's exciting. And I think it's an important thing that, like, I hope doesn't just get commodified and then like thrown out as, like something that's just one note because like you said, it's so vast and it almost is about more of like a creative energy than an actual sound, you know. But I don't know if I would consider myself fully a hyperpop artist. I've been so lucky to work with so many people in that world and I'm so inspired by, you know, like legends like Sophie who have just approached the way they make music in a particular way and I think that's what I'm trying to do more than anything. It's like try to challenge myself and make things that will hopefully challenge other people in some way, or just be iconic and fun if nothing else, you know? I think that's also a second question. Close. Do you recommend that to such a fine tool? No, everyone here has such good style. I feel like I have no authority to say anything, honestly. But yeah, shop vintage. Yeah, but I mean everybody knows that that's the way to go, is what I'd say. Does anyone else have questions? Let's go to the member over here with the scarf. Thank you. So, you mentioned about the troubles, the issues that you face when after the video release and the backlash you got, and I've also watched the video of your video on Buzz where you also discussed that. And I was wondering, what would you say to people that are facing that at the moment and like the backlash and depression and other issues like that? What would you say to them and what would you recommend to them to help them get through that period? It's, you know, I mean, I think there's so much advice that I still have to learn from in terms of healing, but, and there's just like truly like no rulebook on how to get through dealing with, you know, I think so many of us are so used to our personal bubbles of like the people that we give authority to and build trust with in terms of like when somebody gives you critique about yourself, you know why they're giving it to you. It's not just like a stranger on the street being like, I think you should do this. Or like, this was bad, bad idea. or whatever the comment is that you get on like a backlash type thing. And so I think even just recognizing that like what that experience is so unnatural, but at the same time, like, you don't have to give validity and authority to what every single person thinks about you. like at the end of the day, like just as much as somebody has, I guess, the right to say whatever they want, you have the right to intake whatever you want. And like building that kind of inner, like, layer of being able to bounce off, or what's a better way to say that? Like, that inner layer that allows you to say, like, I agree with that or not is so important to building who you are. And that doesn't mean that, like, you won't be able to take or not take criticism through that, too, because that criticism is so different than backlash, right? And, yeah, I just, I really think that, like, us as people just can't be defined by one thing or one moment or one decision. And also, the Internet lacks context most of the time, and that's, like, one of its, like, biggest failure. years right now. So that makes things a lot a lot more difficult in terms of like in taking comments or people writing comments, you know. Yeah, I hope that makes sense. Yeah. Let's go to the member on the end of the front row. Thank you. I feel like in the past couple years has been kind of counter movement in pop culture of reflecting on people who have had a moment of fame years ago and people who at the time unfailing mistreated people like Hayden, Christensen and Brendan Fraser who are now seeing a big resurgence in popularity and a kind of recontextualizing of everything and I was wondering how much you've felt that and how that's changed your relationship to that time in your life? That's a good question. I mean, I think my relationship with that time in my life is really unique because one, I was literally so young that like most of this, Most of us don't remember much about, like, you know, the times when we were 13 and the everyday moments, unless they were, like, really traumatic or, like, really exciting, you know? Like, in terms of the other pieces of my life from back then that I remember, it's like, I remember the Justin Bieber concert that I went to. Or, like, I remember, like, the really fun trip I took with my family, my friends, you know? So it is bizarre to see so many people, I guess again, like, be surprised with the person that I am now and put that right next to this version of myself that like honestly doesn't really even feel like it's mine anymore. Like there is like this very particular image of like the Friday video where like it's me in front of the fake bus stop with like the backpack on. And like it I don't even think that that. That's like, even though it is a picture of me, it feels like as outside of myself as like it probably feels to anybody else here. Like it feels like something that doesn't even feel like a real piece of my life because it's become like more of a symbol of this thing of, you know, what people think I am are also. I don't really know a better way to say that. Yeah. It's interesting to watch the internet grow and shift a narrative that it's had on its own. And I've felt that over the last 12 years, but definitely over the last couple years, especially as I became more vocal and learned how to articulate who I was a little bit more and find myself on the internet. like I watched the internet shift its perspective with me and it went from being like this bizarre random internet moment to like oh this song feels like it represents like a nostalgic piece of time or a nostalgic piece of internet culture or watching people also grow up and learn from like what maybe they would now consider mistakes and how they dealt with that moment moment and saying like I can't believe that I said this or that I let myself do this or I can't believe that the internet let this happen to a child you know and it's interesting I think what I hope again the the context thing is so important because yes this thing happened it was crazy it's awesome to see so many people now look back and say like oh my god I would never do that now I hope that internet never lets this happen again, but like it is happening to other people and it's happening to other kids. And like you can have somebody say that one day and then literally two seconds later see them comment on like, you know, some TikTok of a kid and making fun of somebody. So I hope that the internet really truly like learns that like these moments that feel isolated are all connected in the ways that we behave with them. So yeah, I guess it's like finding the threads through the things. internet is the most interesting piece. Thank you. Let's go to the member from Keeble College. Hiya, thank you for coming. I was just wondering if there's any artists or producers that you'd like to collaborate with in the future, as you said. It was a very collaborative album, but if there's anyone that you've not yet collaborated with that you'd like to. And then the sort of second part, if there's any other creative industries, you'd like to, you'd like to tap into a bit more? You know, you said you were a musical theater kid, so if you wanted to get more into that or something like that. Yeah. Oh my god, there's so much that I want to do. I mean, I think I've found such like a sweet spot in becoming such a directive part of like the visuals that I create and that's really learning that like I can go as crazy as I want to and come up with the more crazier ideas that I have and execute them and know that my audience will like live for them the most, that's really exciting as like a theatrical kid. And it's, I think finding like, I just try to bring that energy that I loved so much as a kid into my shows and into that. But in the future, like, I would love to go do everything and, you know, explore different types of art and works, works that I don't know would be so interesting but in terms of artists I mean I'm so inspired by so many different people I mean I'm a huge fan of like Trent Rezner and I thought it was so exciting when like even just hearing about them at Nine In In In Innings Nail's like working on like that Halsey record a few years ago I love to see these like more kind of detached genres of music come together and make something interesting and I think that like the album was such a good place that can go so much further and I would love to try to take it there with somebody like like them. I mean, I love Apex Twin. Like I would love to work and do something just really surprising and challenging. God, I don't know. I love artists like Mitzky. I love Carolyn Polichick, who we're here is here tonight somewhere in the city. Obviously, I've been so inspired by people like Sophie, I love Charlie, LexiX. Oh, Addison Ray. I am obsessed with her. And I think that we could say of pop music legitimately if we worked together. So Addison, hit me up. Yeah, yeah, there's so many, I think, exciting people and faces out there. And it's really encouraging to see so many, like, to be in a time where music can be truly as niche as it deserves to be and people will resonate with that. Let's go to the member at the back. Such good questions. It's so fun. Hi Rebecca. Thank you so much for speaking to us tonight. I suppose there's been this discussion in the last few years around exploitative contracts in the music industry. And I know you mentioned that, you know, when, you know, in the Friday era, you know, you were thinking about that as being something for your resume and, you know, doing something cool. You know, how do you now view, you know, production companies like that, which you worked with and, you know, how they can potentially sometimes, you know, treat early career artists, you know, poorly? Um, hmm. I mean, I'm trying to be ginger with what I'm saying, or what I say about this because I do think it's important. This was something else we were talking a little bit about before I came down. The music industry and the entertainment industry, like any other industry, is set up by adults working in only their own best interests because it's a job, right? It's a way to make money, it's a way to make a living, it's a way to do things. And unfortunately, in the entertainment industry, specifically, a lot of children get involved. And there's literally no way to involve children without exploiting them in some way, no matter what you're doing. Luckily, in more traditional parts of the entertainment industry, like the film industry maybe, I can't speak for everything because I don't know, but there's been more time for standards to be put in place to protect kids, right? So you have like set laws and child labor laws and things like having a set teacher involved with something to make sure a kid is being treated like a child and protected. And yeah, I mean, I, how do I wrap that up nicely? I think that unfortunately there's just many parts of the industry that exist everywhere, whether we know about them or not, that don't have those same protection set up. And like, that is just not right, obviously. And I wish that it was an industry that, like, put children's ethics and ethics around children before anything else. But unfortunately, I'm not the one guiding every person. So, yeah, it's a, yeah. Thank you. And let's go to remember in the Green Jumper. Hi Rebecca. I guess just for context, one of the things I admire the most about you is how unashamedly yourself you are and how brave and open you are, whether it's sharing mental health experiences or, you know, your lived experience of your sexuality or the, you know, horrible experiences that you went through. And I guess given all that you've spoken about, night about how hard that was and how unprepared you were and the lasting impact that hadn't you, where did the bravery and the resilience that you had to going to get off the mat and come out and put all that work in and share all that work with the world, how did you, how did you face that? And I guess for other people who are kind of coming back from a really difficult experience, how did you kind of stand up and go again? I'd really like to know. Thank you. I mean, there were so many moments, and I have so many moments still, where things get really, really, really difficult, right? And there's no person that can take you to the place that you need to be emotionally, right, other than yourself. I mean, yes, like, therapy is so important, but it is you that shows up every day to do the work on yourself. It's you that shows up every day to take the advice. And I've had a lot of really hard and dark moments with myself growing up. But at the end of the day, like, I think whether this was conscious enough or conscious or not, I oftentimes think of who I was, like before Friday ever existed and who I felt like I wanted to be when I grew up as a child. And I think about, like, the things that brought me joy and the things that brought me, like, vitality as a kid, right? And adventure and fun and all of those things, I would just be so heartbroken if I, like, let all of that go. And I think about how maybe like disappointed my younger self would be if she were to one day watch me give all of that up, like not on my own accord, you know, or because I was afraid or because I was ashamed and like, yeah, I think. Once I realized that what I was struggling with so much was just shame and how none of us deserve to have shame really, or like shame just as a whole is like the most like bone-curdling, like, soul-freezing experience that we can have. and shame comes from other people, not from ourselves. Like, we are not born with any version of shame. It was just a matter of, like, how do I let this go and process this? And what will happen when I do that? And then I started to find that, like, leaving my body a little bit. That's a weird way to say that, but I don't know. I'm cold, so my brain's thinking weirdly. But once I started to, like, let some of that go. I was happier. I had more creativity. I feel like I felt just like myself and like I could make decisions and lead my own life and that everybody deserves that. I don't know as I got older and had more perspective. It just once I started getting little semblances it was like this is I deserve this. We all deserve this like every single person in this room deserves to have that experience and that I feel lucky that like whatever that was in my brain that like pushed me through that that I was able to have that experience and be here yeah um let's have maybe one last question and let's go to the member of the front um I just wanted to ask what's your creative process like and how do you create something that authentically reflects you are. Oh, I mean, it's so different every time. And I think it all just comes with like starting with a question, starting with an idea and knowing that like the idea that you start with may be not a single piece of what the finished product is like at all. But a lot of time it's just like the very, very beginning is sitting with yourself in silence and a lot of times I'll open up my journal when I know that I'm about to go write and just like start talking to myself and see what is actually on my mind because I've found that like there's a surface level of what we're all thinking about but the quieter and quieter that you can get and the more that you can get what is in here just out in some version and that doesn't always come through like physically writing a lot of times that can also just be like in a studio with a mic and just start start somewhere. That's how you find some really special stuff when you try not to like, I know this sounds so cheesy, but when you try not to think about it too much, because those like natural decisions, I think, are really important. And then as far as finishing stuff creatively, it's just a matter of trusting your instinct. Like I think it doesn't, nothing feels done until it's done. And I don't know how else to explain that other than, like, like, I will go through 20 versions of a song. I'll work on a song for six months. I'll work on a song for two years. And as long as I have that kind of inner knowingness of like, this is really good, but like it's not done, I know that. And I just have to trust that. And then one day with enough changes that I make or notes that, like, me and a producer will make on a song, one day that feeling does go away. and trusting that as well is another challenge. But yeah, so I guess it's almost like downloading information that the world gives you and trying to do something with it, I guess. Thank you. And one question that we ask all of our guests is, if you could give our students one piece of advice, what would it be? what you have to offer to the world is truly unique and the way in which that you perceive something and your point of view is just as worthy and just as important and just as interesting as anybody else is and like the world isn't complete without it. So whatever thread that is, that you find that is so important to do so and will lead to so much creativity and fun and reason within your life and and also in terms of I guess my story like you are literally defined by nothing than what you just you choose to define yourself by and it doesn't matter how many people tell you otherwise you You are the only decision maker. And once you find that, you find everything, I think. Yeah, thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks for having me. But thank you very much for coming tonight. Thank you for having me. It's been so fun. I'm
