 I now look to Imam Mullah Hussain to continue the case for the proposition. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. What a great pleasure is it Madame President and ladies and gentlemen to be here in the Oxford Union and thank you very much for all the contributions thus made. Has anyone heard of the path of love and beauty in Islam? beauty of soul, beauty of character, harmony with the natural world. And as the late Anne-Marie Chimel said, when commenting on why she liked Islam, she said, because the Muslims take God seriously. They are aware that God, the one, is near us, here and now, and yet cannot be described. either by intellectual or by supra intellectual means, but can be experienced by the pure loving heart. The purpose and function of a spiritual path must be, in the words of the great poet, philosopher and reformer Muhammad Iqbal, your prayer is that your destiny, destiny be changed. My prayer is that you yourself be changed. It is individual transformation that leads to a vision and attitude of living a life of inner peace, of beauty and compassion that touches and embraces all that comes into one's orbit in this earthly life. Now you might well be wondering what Islam am I speaking about as one of the tragedies of our times is that such a beautiful path has been submerged by the ugliness of violence of hatred and division, unleashed primarily by puritanical groups or those motivated and intent from gaining political power over the Muslim masses. Contemporary Muslim nation states have used the name of Islam to justify oppression and tyranny, thereby suffocating human happiness and spiritual flourishing. What has gone wrong? Well, first, let me share with you how the path of Islam was defined by the blessed Prophet Muhammad, Sallah, Allah, and blessings be upon him. He defined the path or the way of life of Islam as being constituting three integral dimensions of Islam, of imman, of its son. First Islam, the path of surrender or submission to God. Islam is that you testify that there is no deity except God and then Muhammad is his messenger that you should perform Salah, that's five daily prayers paid the Zaka pay 2.5% to the poor and the needy. Fast during Ramadan and perform if one is able to the pilgrimage, the hodge to the holy house and second is imman or faith it is that you believe in God and his angels and his books and his messengers and in the last day and in gatheral fate both in its good and its evil aspects third its son that is excellence beauty and harmony it is that you should worship God as if you see him, though if you cannot see him, know that he sees you. Over the last, over the first three centuries, these three dimensions evolved into numerous schools of law or theology and its son, the beautiful path of so-called Sufism. Islam is not an organized religion, for example in the sense that the Catholic Church is. Scholar jurists who were exceptionally gifted with the most brilliant minds developed methodologies to interpret the two primary sources of Islam, Quran, which is the word of God and the sunnah, the practice, and the president of the prophet. This development was from the grassroots, and it was the brilliance of the scholar jurists that resulted in the growing and diverse Muslim community having the choice, the choice to follow one of them. A similar development took place with the schools of theology and beauty, or popularly known as Sufism. My teacher used to remind me that theology was like Madison. every now and then a little is okay but you can't live on it. However, about a couple of hundred years ago reformist movements emerged whose first onslaught was this integral model of the path of Islam and in particular the path of beauty and harmony. Sufism. It is therefore no surprise that Sufi communities have been targets of suicide bombing. and killings by puritanical extremist groups. I believe that the vision of Sufism and the values that it practices are ones that are contemporary, our contemporary world needs. Its business and core are the human heart. The great struggle or jihad that we must aspire to is to search for meaning within ourselves. As the greatest exponent of the path, Bolesha in the 17th, 18th century states, you have learned so much and read a thousand books. Have you read yourself? You have gone to mosques and temples. Have you ever visited your soul? you are busy fighting Satan have you ever fought your ill intentions you have reached into the skies but you have failed to reach what's in your heart or our master Molan Arumi find the sweetness in your own heart then you may find the sweetness in every heart your heart your heart is a size of inner go find yourself in its hidden depths. Goodbyes are only for those who love with their eyes. Because for those who love with heart and soul, there is no such thing as separation. And you have to keep breaking your heart until it opens. So Molan Arumi was an Islamic scholar of great distinction. But it was the meeting with a wandering the way, Shamsi Tabriz, that opened his heart to the path of beauty and of love. One of his biographers states, the encounter with Shams triggered the completion of a paradigm shift in rumors approach to piety and spirituality. He discovered that beyond the safe, dry, and socially approved forms of obedience, that is prayer, sermonizing, discovering and applying the principles of law and renunciation, fasting, controlling, and passions, and ego. There is a meta-spirituality of love, which consists in joyously and creatively celebrating our relationship with God. Humanity is facing huge challenges. such as the climate crisis, the fear of each other, and sometimes the diversity that exists in the world. Organized religions, and here I mean religions who are fixated upon the outward, rather than the life-affirming and enhancing inner aspect, have failed properly to address the challenges modern life has thrown at us. climate crisis, mental well-being, our relationships with fellow human beings and technological change. The answers lie in the deepest recesses of the world's great spiritual traditions, and not necessarily in the mere outer forms, because that is what the opposition represents. I conclude with a message from Rumi that is pertinent to our times, especially in the light of suffering inflicted through wars and all sorts of extremisms. Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bow of, for your heart so that fresh green leaves can grow in their place. It pulls up the rotten roots so that new roots hidden beneath have room to grow. Whatever sorrow shakes from your heart, far better things will take their place. Thank you. Thank you.
