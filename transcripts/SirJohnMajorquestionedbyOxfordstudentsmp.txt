 Thank you very much, Sir John, for those fascinating opening remarks. One thing that struck me throughout was from almost explicitly quoting for the many, not the few, to your comments on Brexit. I was wondering, when you look at the contemporary Conservative Party, do you find it familiar? Do you think it resembles that which you led? or do you feel like a stranger in your own party? Well, I'm glad you start with an easy question. I'm very great for you for doing that. Things change, things move on. And the Conservative Party began to become more ideological, I think, in the 1980s. And what happened in the 1980s and in the 1992 election is that the members of Parliament who had either served in the war or who had lived and understood the immediate post-war years and that determination that never again would we be split away from our European neighbours retired from Parliament and a new and younger generation who hadn't had those experiences came in and it was a more ideological intake so it has evolved since then Parliament's always changed there's nothing especially novel about that so it has changed from the period where the Conservative Party was much more consensual than it has subsequently become. It has changed. And do you feel disconnected from it? Well, it's difficult to be disconnected for something you joined in 1959. I've been there quite a long time. So I don't feel disconnected from it, no. It still has the same basic underlying principles, but it just places them, I think, in a different order of priority at the moment. Politics is like a stream. It will carry on and it will change and it will change back again. So no, I don't feel disconnected from my party. I think it has changed. Many of the things that it gives priority to would not have been my priorities. Things change. They may change again. I'm sure that they will. One of the things you attributed to being the cause of the breakdown in politics recent years was the ability of fringe ideologues to take control of mainstream parties. There's always been influential ideologues from our ex-president Tony Bend, people like Enoch Powell or Sir Keith Joseph in the Conservative Party. Why do you think that nowadays the ideologues are able to get more power and influence in the parties than they were in the past? There are more of them. It's as simple as that. I mean, in the period that I was in Parliament, of course we had a right wing. At one stage we had the Empire loyalists, then we had a whole range of different. groups that formed. But two things have changed. One, they knew they were a minority, and they expressed their views to keep the flame of their ideals alive. But they didn't actually press it in the way that happens these days now that there are more people in Parliament who have non-mainstream views. And so I think that is what has changed. There's been a slight change in culture, and there's been a change in the number of people who are actually in Parliament who have those different views. What I think lies at the core of this is the change in the constituency parties over the past 40 or 50 years. 40 years ago, when I first joined the young conservatives, there were a million members. It was the greatest and most successful marriage bureau the world has probably ever seen. But there were huge numbers of people in the young conservatives and the Conservative Party was a really mass membership party. There were far fewer distractions in the 1950s and 60s than there are today that people can do. And the same thing has happened to the other parties as well. So the constituency parties have hollowed out. Now who has left? The people who have left are those who are least political, but used to ally themselves to either Labour or the Conservatives or the Liberal parties that they have left. And the people who have remained are the people who are, most convinced of the philosophy of those parties. So that instinctively makes them a little more ideological and it is they who pick candidates for the next parliament. It's not just a problem for the Conservative Party. It exists right the way across politics. And I don't see a day in which the political parties are going to be mass movements in the way that they were in the post-war years. I think that is extremely unlikely. What is important is to make sure that increasingly we seek a proper mixture of people in Parliament and that we try and persuade some of the most able people that it is career that is worthwhile. There are many people who turn away from politics these days because they don't like the way it's conducted because it doesn't pay very well if one takes a Merson review because they don't want the harassment that one actually gets from social media and elsewhere. There are a whole range of good reasons why not to be in politics. But if all the most able people were to turn away from politics, it would certainly diminish the quality of government successively, the more that happened. So one does need a fair proportion of the best people to take an interest in it because it does involve running our country. Taking it then a level above the constituency party to party leadership, you were one of the last leaders of the Conservative Party to be selected purely by the parliamentary Conservative Party for the reforms in the 2000s, which made the leadership determined by a ballot of the members. Do you think that particularly given the events of the last 12 months, this leads to that level of ideological takeover, and would you think it would be a positive step for the Conservative Party and perhaps other parties to go back to a system where the parliamentary parties have more control over the leadership selection? That's a splendidly double-edged. question. I think it's quite difficult to go back. I mean, the truth of the matter is that when the mass party votes for the leader of the Labour or Conservative Party, they don't know the person they are voting for. They know what they read about the person they are voting for. They see the prospective candidates through the filter of the media and through the filter of social media, but they don't know them. They haven't sat with them. They haven't sat with them. They haven't talked with them. They don't know what their strengths and weaknesses are. They don't know how firm they would be in times of crisis, how compassionate they would be in times of difficulty. So I have always thought the wisest ways for the choice to be made by the people who know them best, that is, their parliamentary colleagues. But that isn't the most democratic way. You can quite see why members of the party in the country who pay their subscription, who knock on doors, who do the work, say, but hang on, you rely on me to get you elected, why shouldn't I have a party in electing you as a party leader? So I can quite see how we have moved to a mass party choice. But I do think it has disadvantages as well as advantages. But you wouldn't seek or advise the chairman of the 2022 committee or chairman of the Conservative Party to look at alternative leadership selection processes. Believe you me, if I were to advise them to do that, they certainly wouldn't take any notice. So moving on then to Europe, Brexit, the Windsor framework. work. In a few months' time, the country will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, something that you spent a long time working on in your tenure. May I first start with a personal question? Does it annoy you, or did it annoy you, that the Good Friday Agreement was signed less than a year, or just about a year after you left office, and Tony Blair was able to take a lot of the credit for it, despite it being years and years of your work? you won't believe this answer but I'll give it to anyway the answer is no I didn't we were we thought a long way towards an agreement in 1996 but we were also a long way behind in the opinion polls and it became perfectly clear that the IRA thought they would get a better deal from any party other than the conservatives they remembered the Bobby Sands affair They remembered all sorts of difficulties that have been over recent years, and they simply would prefer to have signed the agreement with someone other than us. So I was perfectly well aware of that. When Albert Reynolds and I started on this in the early 90s, we both realise that it may not be concluded in our premierships or in Albert's case, very sadly, in his life. So my principal thought afterwards, I should say this. when I first began the Northern Ireland process I talked privately to John Smith who was then the leader of the Labour Party and we sat in my room sipping whiskey one evening after a debate and I told John exactly what we were planning to do under Privy Council terms and in those days they were invariably honoured and I can see him now picking up his glass of whiskey swilling it around taking a large shrieg and saying right Northern Ireland well, there are no votes in it. We'll support you all the way. And he did. And so did Tony Blair. The Labour Party were absolutely honourable in the way they supported that. And when Tony went ahead, my principal thought was pleasure that he had taken it so seriously and that he reached an agreement. And to be absolutely fair to Tony, he has never hesitated to indicate the role that was played by his predecessors. So my principal concern was pleasure that it had happened. And if you had seen the way Ireland lived in those days, the fear that existed on the streets, the news bulletins that began routinely, a soldier was killed, there was an explosion. And all that ended. A Northern Ireland is a wholly different place from the one it was. And the relationship between the north and the south of Ireland, wholly better than it was. the UK's relationship with Southern Ireland, the Republic, infinitely better than at any time in history it has been. There's a short blip a couple of years ago for reasons I don't immediately recollect, but it is on balance much better. So the whole relationship has changed and that's something I'm very pleased about. Do you think that the Windsor Framework fixes many of the problems caused by the Northern Ireland backstop? Well, the previous protocol was very poorly designed, I think. Tony Blair and I went together during the referendum to Northern Ireland, to warn of the dangers of leaving the European Union precisely because of the problems it would create with Northern Ireland and the difference between North and South, also being the border of the European Union. and we were told by the then leader of the DUP and the Lenn Northern Ireland Secretary that we didn't know very much about Ireland between us and they proceeded. I think things have changed so much. I think the protocol was badly negotiated the first one. I think what has been done this time is much more detailed, much more effective. It still has some problems. There are still some problems with it. I mean, one conceivable problem with the Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement, is that it requires agreement from both the major parties before the Assembly can sit. And that is a lacuna. I think that is something you might want to look at in due course. But I think it was an excellent negotiation, the Good Friday Agreement, and I'm full of praise for the way it was done. in terms of the barriers to now the framework going through again it's that ideological wing of the party that you're referring to in a certain blonde ex-president of ours do you think that that will be a barrier to the framework passing or do you think it'll be more of a challenge to rishi student acts party leadership and the unity of the conservative party I'm no longer in Parliament so I must preface my answer with that and so I don't know all the members of Parliament in the way I once did so I can't be absolutely certain but I would be surprised if it didn't go through if the Prime Minister puts it before Parliament he will have the support at most of the Conservative Party perhaps overwhelmingly the support of the Conservative Party and I think almost without exception and the support of the Labour and Liberal parties as well. So yes, I think it will go through. And I think it should. You say then you're not in Parliament. This leads me on to a question I wanted to ask, which is that after you stepped down from the House Commons in 2001, you turned down the then customary peerage that Prime Ministers were offered. Why did you do so? And do you regret it now? No, I don't regret it. Absolutely not. I mean, I'd spent a long time in Parliament and before that involved in politics. to the extent it wholly dominated my life really and I thought I finished with politics I didn't see at any point in going to the House of Lords and I didn't think it was proper to take a title go to the House of Lords and not do the work so I had no hesitation in not accepting the offer of a peerage I have never regretted it I'm not in the House of Lords I don't intend to go to the House of Lords I much respect the work the Lords do but my active party political days are finished. Why do you think then that some of those who sat in very prominent positions around your cabinet table like Lord Hustleton or Lord Clark have chosen to do so? Well, you must ask them. I mean, in terms of Ken Clark, Ken eats, sleeps and drinks politics. I mean, politics are the oxygen of life to Ken. Well, that and jazz. And cigars. And cigars and eating and the occasional drink are absolutely the component parts of Ken's life. So I'm unsurprised. And Michael is an instinctive politician at the end of his fingertips and far beyond. As you probably saw here, I think only a fortnight or so ago. So they have different priorities. It just wasn't for me. And speaking of the House of Lords, one of your successors, Gordon Brown, has seemed to make his post-prime ministerial career or project, I suppose, constitutional, particularly aimed at the House of Lords. Do you think the significant House of Lords reform is needed? If so, do you back Gordon Brown's proposals for a Chamber of the Regions and Nations? No, I don't. I mean, Gordon is very clever and he's produced a very skillful, very skillful suggestion. But I think there are several things about the House of the House of. Yes, it needs reforms. It is ludicrous that the House of Lords is the second largest assembly in the world other than the Chinese conference. That's rather stupid. There are 900 members of the House of Lords theoretically. If they all turn up, there aren't enough seats for them all, they'd be queuing outside. So obviously that needs changing. And so do some of the rules by which the House of Commons works. One suggestion is that we should elect the House of Lords because it's democratic. I have heard of many stupid suggestions in the world, but that is pretty much at the top of them. The House of Lords is not an initiating chamber. the House of Lords is a revising chamber. It doesn't necessarily need politicians in it, particularly hack politicians who are sent there to vote for the government or the opposition. It needs people who have experience of life who can revise serious bits of policy to make sure that the legislation eventually passed is the best legislation we can properly frame. It's a totally different proposition from the House of Commons. And if you produced an all-elected House of Lords, which many people, without thinking, I suspect, actually favour, you would get a second-rate version of the House of Commons. I have always taken the view that if the answer to any question is more politicians, it's the wrong question. So, no, I don't favour election. So the reforms I would make would be, well, perhaps to some of the ways they're nominated, perhaps some of the ways they are approved, certainly to some of the ways it works, but I would not change it into an elected chamber, and I would halve its size. 900 is ludicrous. Four to 500 would be ample. Speaking more than about the general culture of politics, you said that obviously the Conservative Party's changed a lot in the last 20, 25 years. One of the big changes, or reversals, I suppose, when you're talking about politics being a stream in post-war British politics, is that from the period of 1964 to 1997, every single British Prime Minister have been state-educated, And yet from 1997 to the present day, I've had two Etonians, Rishi Sunak, Tony Blair, who attended private schools. Do you think that social mobility in politics has gone downhill in the last 25 years? And do you think, as someone who left school at 15 now, you'd have the same ability to progress in politics as you did? Well, if you progress in politics, you need an extraordinary amount of luck, wherever you come from, whether you come from a privileged background or a pretty ordinary background. I think politics used to be the preserve of people from a fairly narrow, from a fairly narrow part of our national constituency. It's a good deal widened now and I think that is welcome. So it seems to me not to matter too much whether one went to public schools or state schools. What matters is whether you have the ability to do the job. And whether also for this matters, whether you think the person chosen as Prime Minister can actually empathise with the difficulties the country is facing. Because we have faced huge difficulties. When people are in difficulty, if somebody can understand the difficulty, understand what they're facing and what they're going through, they are more able to be able to do something to help. And I think that is an important part of politics. So I welcome the fact that people from far more diverse backgrounds now get both into Parliament. This might be cheeky of me, but I assume from that comment that you don't believe all your successes have had that ability to empathise with the problems people are facing. You might say that. I couldn't possibly comment. I'll ask one or two questions about foreign policy, then we'll open up to the questions from the audience. I was interested about what you're saying about, again, to quote a phrase, I don't normally like quoting global Britain and Britain accepting its place as a leading major power, but accepting that it's not a superpower. I remember listening to a recording of you speaking, I think it was at the Hay Festival a couple of years ago, about the withdrawal from Afghanistan, and you were decrying it as being Britain, you know, firmly abdicating her responsibilities to the people of Afghanistan and Britain's role on the world stage. Do you think that Britain should play an active and interventionist role? in promoting democracy and liberal British values across the world? Or do you think that all of that stuff needs to go along with the idea that we are global Britain and the superpower? No, I don't think that at all. I think we certainly have a role in promoting democracy. I mean, a great deal of the world's democracy is actually a variant of what we introduced first in this country. And I think we do have a moral obligation to continue to play a role in that. to play a role in that. I mean, I referred to the fact that we were scuttled from Afghanistan, largely at the insistence of the United States. It wasn't practical to say if they were going, and they were going. But look, what has happened? There's been this vast increase in in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, in, nature of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Afghanistan and Syria are two of the nations that are providing the largest number of these additional migrants. And you can see how desperate they are. If they're going to risk their lives and that of their families in these perilous dinghies going firstly across either the Channel or the Mediterranean, or both, you can understand the desperation they feel. And if you look at where around the world, the whole world is in a migratory mold at the moment, but where are they mostly coming from? They're coming from Afghanistan. They're coming from the Congo. They're coming from Albania. They're coming from a whole range of coming from Syria. They're coming from countries where the public, the people, are jealous of the freedoms and opportunities that they see in other countries. and because these people may be poorly educated and because these people maybe have very little it doesn't mean they care less about the future of their children and their lives than we do here in this room who would object to anybody in this room doing something to better the position of their family we would applaud it what do you think these migrants are doing they're trying to better the condition of their family And part of the reason there are so many is because the conditions in their countries are so dire and in some cases in the case of Afghanistan we moved away from a position where things were getting better and the Taliban returned and made them immensely worse it's now impossible for girls to go to university and for girls to get an education again that's 15th century not 21st century So there is a responsibility on the richer and more powerful nations of the world to consider what the secondary effects and the third set of effects are on the policies they follow. And we have one real problem with this. Forgive me if I go on about this for a moment, but I think it is relevant. In 1946 at the San Francisco Opera House, the victors of the war and others signed the United States. Nations Charter and set it in being. And they set up the permanent five, the permanent five security members of the United Nations, Russia, China, the United States, France and the UK. They were arguably the most powerful nations in the world in 1946. They are not now. Consider Germany, consider Brazil, consider South Africa, consider Japan. And at the moment, each one of those permanent five has a very very very. veto on policy. United Nations can do nothing in Ukraine, officially, because Russia can veto any action they wish to take. Now that is absurd in a body that was actually set up primarily in an attempt to stop the world going to war. It needs reforming, but which of the permanent five nations is going to give up its secure and happy position as one of the permanent members and suggests that the permanent membership should be increased. I think it should be increased. I think there should be two reforms. It should be increased so that the permanent members are perhaps 10 to 11 members, embracing the countries I've just mentioned, like Brazil and others. And the one nation veto should go. If there has to be a veto, let it be three nations. So that the United Nations is not hamstrung from doing so many of the things that it was actually set up to do. Now, if you... you look around the world, where is the statesman big enough and powerful enough to bring the world together and force that change through? I don't immediately see him or her. Now, it happened at the end of the war because the world had gone through such a cataclysm. People were prepared to make really significant changes in the way in which the world operated, and that of course also applied to the establishment of the European Union, starting off as the iron, coal, steel community in the 50s. And we need to look almost all of the immediate post-war architecture is out of date in one form or another, whether it's the World Health Organization, the World Bank, or whatever it may be. But sadly, it is difficult to see how we get out of the rut in which they need reform, but nobody can institute reform. or agree upon what the reform should be. It would be a better world if we could. But ultimately, to talk about the issue of the week, you mentioned migrants, refugees, asylum seekers, etc. The government's new asylum bill seems to rely on this portrayal of the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister have been peddling both in the commons and in interviews and in statements that asylum seekers seem to pose this existential threat to the fabric. of this country or to the quality of the lives of Britons. Do you agree with this portrayal and do you support the government's outlined asylum plans? This is very complex because let's draw a distinction between asylum and other people who don't come through the asylum system. There are two reasons why people don't come through the asylum system. Firstly, the asylum system is very inadequate. A lot of people don't actually have a practical opportunity of getting onto it. and secondly there are lots of people who seek to come here who don't who aren't genuine asylum seekers so there are those there are those two strands sheer practicality says we cannot take everybody in our small island who wishes to come that is a very difficult problem and we can't we can't possibly do it and neither can Europe Europe accepted over a million people over a very short period of time collectively. But the demand now is absolutely astronomical, and it needs a real international effort to deal with it. But when people run asylum together with other people, what is really causing the trouble is the people who are coming in the rubber boats. They are less than one-tenths of the people who actually migrate to this country. We need to actually look at the figures more carefully, and the whole things are sort of bled together as though it was a single problem, it's not, there are a whole series of different component parts to this problem. I don't have an easy solution to it. Some of the solutions that have been proposed are not the solutions I would have proposed, I put it as mildly as that, but there is a problem and we need to try and deal with it. Now it does need to be dealt with collectively. The Prime Minister is meeting the President to France on Friday. And that's very important because we need a collective action with the European nations that we once had when we were members of Europe and now don't. We need to reconstitute that. We need to be able to work collectively so that a fair burden is shared between countries across Europe. We also need to look more widely and see whether there are things that we can do that can stem the desire of people wishing to move in the first place by utilisation collectively of overseas aid and other special areas of that sort. You can see that people feel they're falling behind in these countries and in many cases they're frightened by the nature of governments they have but also frightened at what their prospects are and all of those different components of the problem may need a different solution. So it's much more complex than what is actually done about the admittedly illegal, but possibly justifiable claims for asylum in this country from many of the people who come in unconventional ways. Final question from me and a bit more of a lighthearted one. You've spoken at length about your dissatisfaction about the portrayal of the royal family and your relationship with Prince Charles in the latest season of the Crown. What are your general thoughts on their portrayal of you? Do you think it's fair? Do you think it's amusing? Do you think it's accurate? I didn't see it. You haven't seen it? No, I didn't watch it. So you can tell me, you'll know better than that. Anyone here who saw the crown all the way through? Right, so what happened to studying then? No, I can genuinely and honestly say I didn't watch the crown. There's a great episode with you at the Gillies Ball at Balmoral, talking to Diana. So watch it just for that bit. It's quite amusing. Well, I can tell you absolutely, I never went to the Gilliers Balls. Right, with that... I was never in Belmoral at the time the Gilliers Ballad was held. And if I had been, I would have avoided it like the plague. We'll open up some questions from the audience. If you have a question, please raise your hand or membership card. We'll go to the person right at the back there because you were very quick. Yeah, yeah, he's looking around, yeah. Yeah. To the left, yeah. Yeah. Thank you. You've talked briefly about public policy, domestic policy, and a sensible domestic policy. With the benefit of hindsight, do you think the privatization of railways was a sensible domestic policy? I had that question written down, so thank you for asking it. I suggest there may have been collaboration here. I don't know, forgive me from saying this, but I doubt you're old enough to remember the nationalised railways. And the reason for privatising the railways, the reason essentially for privatising the railways was that there was no investment going into them and there has been the most extraordinary investment in the private sector. What I think has gone wrong is two things. we were originally intending to privatise them with rail part of the privatisation on a regional basis and we persuaded by experts that that would be a bad idea because the investment wouldn't actually go into the rail it would all go into the rolling stock and that would be dangerous and I think actually the split of rail away from the main part of the privatisation in retrospect I think that was a mistake the other thing I think that has been happened of course what we originally did was changed quite considerably by the incoming government in the late 1990s who deposes the privatisation. And I think you might equally direct that question to John Prescott as well as to me. And I would be extremely interested to hear what he has to say about it. So I don't see how any British government is going to be able to afford the investment that British rail needs. Whether you can change and improve the management, whether you can change and improve the structure, I've no doubt now with the experience that we can, but I don't think taking it back into public ownership, unless you're prepared to see your taxes rise quite substantially just for that single issue, is a practical proposition. Next question, please. We'll go to the member over here. Sorry, I'm making it lots of walking, Finley. Thank you. So I'd say that back on Northern Ireland a little bit, I'd say that there's quite a strong feeling in Northern Ireland that it's been... Sorry, it's going to get a little muddled, I can't quite hear it. Can you... Is it better? Yep. I'd say that there is a bit of a feeling in Northern Ireland that the country's being used a little bit as a pawn when it comes to kind of the hardline Brexiteers, and that that might have somewhat shifted now with Rishi Sunak. However, do you think that he was going to be able to kind of suppressed that part of the party still, or do you think that that might have like a stronger impact now on the Windsor framework now that's going to be negotiated upon? He's about, I don't know the present Prime Minister well. He is younger than my son. So there's quite a gap, let me just put it that way, but he is a serious politician. I do know that he spends his time looking at the minutiae of policy. So I think he realizes the difficulties of Northern Ireland. I think he will legislate not for the headlines, but for the reality of what is right for the people of Northern Ireland. I believe that will be the case, and we will have to wait and see. But I think his negotiation of the revised protocol was very skillfully done, and I find that very encouraging. I mean, there is a lot to be done in Northern Ireland. One problem with Northern Ireland is that the assessment, hasn't been sitting for over a year. Now that's absolutely crazy. People think of Northern Ireland and they think can it preserve peace? What about the political difficulties? Is there going to be United Ireland and all this stuff? Meanwhile there are serious problems in the education system, in the health system, in the degree of investment, in private business, all of which need the assembly to be sitting. And while the assembly is not sitting, those problems are not getting solved because the government of Westminster had devolved effectively running Northern Ireland to the Civil Service. But they can't initiate new policy. They can only run things as they were with the money that was voted to them. So policy in Northern Ireland is standing still at a time when there's a great deal to be done. We must get the assembly back. Next question. We'll go to the member here in the blue shirt on the front row. Thank you. I was wondering, you've talked a lot about the... Could you get it, little question? Yeah, sorry, you've talked a lot about the effect of Brexit on Northern Ireland, but I wonder what you think the effect will be on Scotland, whether you think Scotland will get independence, and whether you think perhaps the resignation of Nicola Sturgeon is the bailout for the Union that it desperately needed. No, I think her successor will continue to try and get independence. Indeed, if they weren't prepared, to do that, they wouldn't get elected as the leader of the Scottish National Party. So they will certainly continue. Whether they will continue in quite the same way, I don't know. Nicholas Sturgeon served for eight years as leader. Take it from me. One thing the Americans have got absolutely right in her constitution is that the president serves only for eight years. Whenever you have Prime Minister serving for longer, troubles occur. And I think she was probably quite wise to resign after eight years after doing, from her perspective, a pretty successful job. Now, do I think Scotland will become independent? Well, there are two answers to that, as there are so often are in politics. The first one is, if there isn't a majority for independent now, after the last three years in the UK, I wonder what set of circumstances could possibly provide one. That's my first and immediate thought. A more serious thought is it does actually depend upon the views of the next generation. And the next generation seem much more inclined, perhaps a inexperience in some ways, to want an independent Scotland. And so the problem isn't going to go away. Now, I don't think successive governments, I'm not just talking of this government, I don't think successive governments for quite a long time, have handled the independence questions, perhaps as wisely as they could. When Westminster has powers, but if it keeps legislating to determine what happens in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, without consulting the first ministers, for example, without examining with them what it might mean in their domains, you're bound to create an antipathy to Westminster. I mean, I would like to see the Prime Minister perhaps set up a very small group of himself and the First Ministers in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, who would meet regularly to discuss the policy that was being passed and what its implications in those territories would be. It seems to be that would be a very sensible thing for them to do. If we're going to kill the desire to become independent, and I think if they did become independent, I think Scotland would be, my view is Scotland would be damaged and so would the rest of the UK by losing Scotland. If we're going to stop that, we have to re-enthuse people with the merits, the virtues of actually working together. And that means removing the things that are such red racks to them at the moment. And that can easily be done. So I think at the moment, the risk of independence of Scotland and for that matter, Northern Ireland, which is a different case, is still very clear. I think it is possible to ease that away, and I think with wise policy, certainly in the case of Scotland, you may be able to do so. The position of Northern Ireland may be different because although not every Catholic in Northern Ireland is a nationalist, increasingly the Catholic population will be larger than the Protestant population. So they pretty nearly are a majority in terms of voting at the moment. they just were at the last election and certainly in five years time they will be so if there were a unity amongst the Catholic population for a united island they would win aboard a poll if they had one so again we need to encourage people in northern Ireland to realise there are benefits in being part of a four nation union so it's a big constitutional question and it's one that can't just be considered when there's a problem and then push to side and left It does need a continuing consideration with those countries about how we remove all the sore spots that cause so much antipathy at the present moment. I'm convinced it can be done. I'm convinced it's in the interest of the United Kingdom as a whole to do it, and I very much hope it will be done. Regarding your eight years' comments, John, can you remind us how long your predecessor and successor served for? No, it slipped my memory. We're talking for one more questions. So please raise your hands. We'll go to the member and the... blue and white over here. You've spoken about how Labour are the clear favourites to win the next election. And you look at the polls on the single issues that the Conservatives are behind labour on the economy, immigration, the NHS, you name it. Apart from hoping that something will turn up to change their fortunes and relying on cold comforts that they believe that Kirstama isn't particularly popular or embraced. What do you think the party you used to lead can and should do to turn their fortunes around? Well, history is really what I have in mind. On the day I became Prime Minister in 1990, we were in an almost identical position. We were well over 20% behind in the opinion polls, there were a maximum of 20 months to go before the election. Labor were absolutely odds on favor to win, and yet we won the election. So I rely on the fact that it has happened before, and whether it will happen next time is out of my hands. I am merely these days an observer. But since it has happened before, I do believe it can happen again, and it was upon that that I base my comments, that nothing is certain in politics. I mean, some of the policies the Labour Party? Well, the Labour Party very wisely haven't produced many policies. There are two that spring to mind. They've decided they will remove the charitable status of private schools, which means private schools would have to pay VAT. Now, many of you may have gone to private schools and have had one of your two parents working just to pay the fees to send you to those schools in many cases. They're not going to be very pleased at that. There must be hundreds of thousands of votes that would scurry straight back to the Conservative Party because of that particular policy. And the only other policy I'm absolutely aware of, though I think Labour are about to produce policies, but the only other one is the probable abolition of the House of Lords, which will not win a single vote anywhere. Indeed, since Lords would then be given the right to vote, it might even lose some in future elections. So I think there are a range of things to be considered. The polls and by-elections are always a different proposition from actually considering who might win the next election. And you may be right. It could be that the Labour Party will win it handsomely. Looking at today's opinion polls, you would certainly think so. I merely look back at history and say it doesn't always pan out as you think. Before we thank Sir John for his time and his wise words, in recognition of decades of service to free speech, public discourse and generally the cause of political engagement among students and education, the trustees and Standing Committee of the Oxford Union have voted to elect Sir John Major as an honorary member of the Society. So please will you join me in congratulating. Thank you very much. Thank you very much again. Thank you. I'm a pleasure. Thank you very. Thank you very. Ladies, gentlemen, please join me in thanking to John Major. Thank you.
