 Tonight, to continue the case for the opposition, it brings me great pleasure to invite sociologists at the University of Washington, Professor Michael Hatcher. In this debate, we are asked to consider whether there's a the nation state is being stretched to its limits, and if so, does this mean we need to move beyond borders? If the nation state is really on the way out, then why are there so many more of them and so many more borders now than there were in the 19th century? The average size of states nearly doubled between 1816 and 1876, but it's contracted thereafter. The rise in state size, size during the 19th century was due to the growth of Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires and of federal democracies, which tend to be large, whereas the decline of average size in the 20th century is the result of an increasing number of unitary democracies and newly independent ex-colonies in the developing world, which tend to be small. The same pattern also holds true for the United Kingdom. In the 19th century, it included a Ireland, but then subsequently lost it. Now there's some concern that Northern Ireland and Scotland may also exit in the future. This suggests that borders must be even more desirable now than they were in the past. I want to persuade you that there are at least two reasons why borders are essential to our way of life. In the first place, they preserve national cultures and help mitigate social polarization. Just think how different it is to live in the USA, which has a unified national culture, to some degree, as against Europe, which has protected its separate cultural identities by promoting national heritages, key to collective identity and expression. Besides helping to maintain cultural integrity within societies, there are also guarantees of cultural diversity at the global level. In the second place, the state cannot exist without them. Just how do borders accomplish these important functions? At the most basic level, they enable authorities to choose the people allowed into state territory. This capacity is beneficial because borders help societies provide public goods. Unlike private goods, public goods, like national defense, public parks, lighthouses, motorways, and social order cannot be excluded from any member of the community. community. These goods are costly to produce, but since no one can be denied access to them, members may have little reason to contribute to their production. Instead, they may be tempted to free ride on the contributions of others. This means that the provision of public goods is always problematic. Now what do borders have to do with the production of public goods? Social scientists have long understood that there are two principal ways to supply. public goods. The first way is simply to coerce the contributions of community members. This solution requires the prior establishment of a coercive institution, namely the state. The state can compel residents to pay the taxes required to fund public goods, and borders make it possible to either admit individuals who can contribute to the supply of public goods or deny them entry to those who would undermine it. Since states have a monopoly of the means of violence within their territory, the elimination of borders is tantamount to the elimination of the state. Just ask Somalis and Honduras. Later. Just ask Somalis and Hondurans how they like living in failed states. The second way is for the community to provide informal social norms that act to encourage members who help produce public goods and dissuade those who are tempted to free ride. These norms are most strongly held by longstanding residents of a territory but are weakest among new arrivals. Last, democracy requires borders for without them there can be no electorate. Obviously, borders can also exclude individuals by discriminating on the basis of race, religion, ethnicity, and other ascriptive characteristics. That some borders may rule out immigrants on racist grounds doesn't imply that they should all be eliminated, however. It does suggest that the criteria for any society's immigration laws should be designed to optimize the community's collective welfare, however, it is conceived. But the argument for borders doesn't rely purely on theoretical grounds. A key empirical case close to home provides highly relevant evidence. Following the establishment of the Schengen Agreement in 1985, national borders were dismantled in member states. The main purpose of the Schengen Agreement is to enable people to freely move through the area. This includes traveling without going through internal border checks, queuing at airports, sea or land borders. In addition, third country nationals in need of a visa to any of the 26 participating countries can travel throughout them with a Schengen visa. So how has this experiment turned out? Despite doing away with national borders, police and immigration controls in the Schengen area have been continued and even strengthened in the wake of increased migration from the Middle East and Africa. Police capabilities have been widened. Cross-border observations and chases have been made. possible, as well as the exchange of fingerprint, DNA, and vehicle data between different police authorities. All told, the Schengen process has led to a significant increase in international police cooperation. National and EU leaders have been engaged in politicized debates about sovereignty. This has not only led to the reintroduction of border checks at the actual physical borders between Schengen states, but also to an increase in the usage of Article 23 of the Schengen Borders Code, which legitimates the policing of internal borders. This code has turned the Schengen area into a tech-controlled space in which ethnic and racial profiling identifies undocumented people for immediate deportation to another member state without any safeguards at all. There are at least four lessons that can be drawn from the Schengen experience. First, Nation states need to be in charge of their own border security to protect their citizens from external threats, such as foreign terrorists and pandemics. Second, unless countries have borders, they can't control the number of people entering their country. Uncontrolled migration causes problems for managing social services such as the health service. Third, having a single external border means relying on foreign police forces for security, whose standards and effectiveness citizens cannot themselves control. And last, free movement of people makes it more difficult to protect against other external threats, such as infectious diseases like SARS or Ebola. Finally, let me conclude by addressing the issue of global crises in a world of nation states. Does the existence of national borders inhibit our prospects for resolving global crises? Without question, global warming is the greatest existential threat to the future of this planet. No doubt, a viable international body that would be able to enforce global rules on carbon emissions, let alone nuclear proliferation and pandemics, would go a long way to resolve these kinds of threats. But the prospects for the existence of such a body at this point are vanishingly small. If the UN is the best it can be done at this time, we've all seen how powerless it is to sanction Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Even in the absence of effective international state, however, progress can still be made on global crises in our world of nation states. Consider the Montreal Protocol on Substances that deplete the ozone layer. The only international agreement that has been ratified by all UN member states, it has successfully regulated ozone emissions since 1919. The key to its adoption is incentive compatibility, which occurs when every state can achieve its best outcome merely by acting according to its own true preferences. Unfortunately, we're currently far from this situation with respect to the regulation of carbon emissions, let alone other global threats. But the elimination of borders can provide no panacea for this existential problem. existential problem.
