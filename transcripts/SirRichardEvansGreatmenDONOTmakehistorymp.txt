 Well, first of all, thank you very much indeed for inviting me to take part in this debate. It's very good to be back here again. Let me begin by noting that the motion on the order papers, this House regrets the great man theory of history. And more than a typo, I think, most of the word is different. So I beg your indulgence in not debating that particular motion. I'm going to argue the proposition that we reject the Great Man theory of history. And there's a similar kind of slippage or a slight but significant difference between what the other side has been saying and what we are saying. The other side seems to be saying that individuals do matter in history, that human beings have some kind of agency, and we're not disputing that. We're saying that individuals do matter in history. It would be pointless and silly to say anything else. What we're saying is that history cannot simply be understood as the acts and lives of great. men. Let's come back to the proposers mention of Thomas Carlisle. He said I quote, the history of the world is but the biography of great men. And everything that happens, everything that happens, he argued. There's always been nothing but, I quote again, the outer material result, the practical realization and embodiment of thoughts that dwelt in the great men sent into the world. And his great men, always been men, of course, in this view, rather than women, are born and not made. They shape and mold history. They're not subject to any conditions or circumstances provided by it. And Carlisle put forward these ideas in his book, Heroes and Hero Worship. He argued that great men are, yes, sent into the world by God to be worshipped. Not without reason. Carlisle has been seen as one of the precursors of fascism. The theory was and remains profoundly undemocratic. All we poor ordinary mortals to do in face with a great man is to lie down and let him run all over us. But the experience of the 20th century has taught us to think of some men whose greatness, if we admit for a moment that they had greatness, was surely negative rather than positive. You might be surprised if I take us my example, Paul, the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Was he a Carlisleian figure who came from nowhere and imposed himself on the history of 20th century Germany in the world? Surely nobody can deny his extraordinary talents as a speaker, politician, military leader. But up to 1919, he was a nobody an unsuccessful would-be artist, Rankinefiel Soldier, as a leader of a tiny ultra-nationalist party through the 20s, he was totally unsuccessful. In the German general election of May, 28, the Nazis under Hitler's leadership won a mere 2.8% of the vote. Certainly it wasn't by his talents alone that he became Reich Chancellor and then dictator, Germany, five years later. What happened, of course, was the economic and social cataclysm of the Depression. When the Wall Street crash in 1929, pulled the rug of American loans surrounded the German economy, causing bank crashes, business collapses, and more than 35% unemployment. terrified by the growing threat of communism, determined to overthrow a democratic system that had only delivered economic failure, political chaos and international humiliation. The political elite put him into power in 1933, even though Hitler had only just won, even then, over a third, just over a third of the vote. They thought they could control him and turn his mass support for their own purposes. We know how wrong they were. But it was their support, aided and abetted later, by the weakness of the Western democracies that launched him on his career as German dictator. But like my friend and colleague Ian Kershaw, the biography of Hitler, in the end, I don't really think it's appropriate to call Hitler great. I'll leave that to you to debate. How about Churchill then? Well, when I was an undergraduate here in Oxford, I was, as it happens, the last undergraduate pupil of Sir Martin Gilbert before his appointment. as Churchill's official biographer. And I've always admired Churchill's wartime leadership. But in 1981, an earlier biographer, Robert Jones, published a book ending in the story in 1939 entitled Churchill, a study in failure. As with Hitler, it was wider historical circumstances that poured power to his hands. The need in 1940 for Britain to be led by a man capable as other leading politicians were not of providing a leadership based on defiance, beliverance, and inspirational rhetoric. And I think the cult of the great man can lead to disaster in politicians who think they're great men when they obviously are not. Classic example in our own time, of course, as we've already been mentioned, Boris Johnson, author of the Churchill Factor quasi-biography, designed to point up supposed similarities between the wartime leader and the writer. I reviewed it for the new statesmen that consisted mainly of pointing up gross factual errors in the book. It was headlined by the new statesman, one man who made history by another who just makes it up. The book was obviously dictated into a recorder using notes provided by research, and I was in cautious enough in my review to say that reading it was like being cornered in the Drones Club by Bertie Wooster and harangue for hours on end. This led to quite a few readers complaining that I'd been unfair. Not to Boris Johnson, but to Bertie Wurton. Worcester. The disasters of Johnson's premiership, the chaos and corruption from which we're all still suffering with a product not least of his deluded belief in his own greatness. Let me draw gradually to a close. Well, I'm not saying, therefore, that individuals have no impact on history. You can find some historians, above all, in the late 20th century, who did say that. Classic example was the French historian Fennon Prudeau, a high priest of the Annal school, who regarded politics, wars, and human evansis, what he called surface disturbances, crests of foam that the tides of history carry on their backs. He denied human agency almost entirely, partly because he wrote the book, amazingly from memory, in a German prisoner of war camp when he was asserting the unchanging nature of La France provonde, unaffected by the temporary calamity of German occupation. But his idea of immobile unchanging history only applied to a certain kind of history, economic, social, and cultural, just as the great man theory is almost always applied to politics and warfare. Does anybody really think that the understanding of the past nowadays is or should be confined just to a narrow part of it? How can we really understand such vital aspects of the past as the environment, sexuality and gender, life, death, population, growth and decline, race, slavery, urbanisation, literacy and education, and so on and so forth? How can we understand that by just looking at the lives of great men. Seems to me that the Great Man theory arrogantly and unjustifiably consigns to oblivion most of the history being studied and written about today and the historians who do the research and writing. History in the end is far too large and diverse a subject to be approached through any one theory or approach. The reason why the Great Man theory has been so widely rejected by historians isn't just because of its contempt for ordinary people and its quasi-fascist political implications, not just because of it sexism, not just because it impoverishes our understanding to the past, it's also because it doesn't actually explain anything. Again, what I'm saying is not saying, I'm not saying is that individuals make no contribution to history. Let me leave you with a quotes. It's already been mentioned from a complex and subtle thinker who suffered for more than a century at the hands of dogmatists who treated him as a great man who's ideas of beyond question, Karl Marx. People, he wrote, and he really did say people, it's often mistranslated as men, but he said, der dimension, make their own history, but they don't make it from freely chosen components, he wrote, not under circumstances they choose themselves, but under circumstances that are directly available, given and transmitted to them. And working out the relationship between people's large. and actions on the one hand and the conditions under which they live and act on the other is surely the most central and fascinating aspect of the study of the past. I beg to support the motion.
