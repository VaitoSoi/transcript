 It gives me great delight to welcome Professor Daniel Markovies to conclude the case for the proposition. Thank you for the invitation. It's a huge pleasure to be here. Thanks to all of you for coming out, especially on such a lovely spring night. When my oldest daughter turned 10, she determined that she would have a dog. And thinking I was clever, I said to her that if she could find a dog that fit inside a bottle cap, we would get it. Now she spent a frustrated half day looking for small dogs. And then she had a brainstorm and started looking for large bottles. And we are now the owners of a black English Labrador named Mephistopheles. I tell you the story because there are two ways to interpret the proposition that we're arguing in favor of. One is to reach the 7% by reducing the number of private school applicants who are admitted to Oxford and Cambridge. The other is to reach the 7% by increasing the number of state school applicants who are admitted and by increasing the student bodies at these universities so they become much larger and educate many more people. That's the version of the proposition that I rise to argue in favor of. Before I do that, let me just summarize where we are at this stage in the debate. Notice that nobody on either side of the proposition has in any way denied the that the status quo is completely unacceptable. That we live in a system right now in which wealthy and privileged people buy educations for their children that no one else can afford. That private schools cost 40,000 pounds for Eaton, 30,000 pounds for Westminster, which does not provide room and board. That one in a hundred students at these schools is on full bursary, that they are full of rich children, and that they dominate admissions to Oxford and Cambridge, in the world that we now have. That going to Oxbridge transforms the life of students who come here. Only 7% you've heard of British people are privately educated, but 40% of the elite is privately educated. 40% of politicians, 40% of high-ranking civil servants, 40% of people in the media and in finance, pop stars are three times as likely to be privately educated as the typical British person. The only elite in England that is not disproportionately privately educated is the English men's football club. That's not fair. It's a grave injustice. It's also dangerous. We've explained that it produces an elite that's out of touch with the society that it governs. It produces an elite that is unable to marshal the will or the skill to make good policy. And it produces enormous resentment. a vicious and toxic politics as the rest are angry at their exclusion. You can see that immediately if you just look at, for example, who voted leave and who voted remain in Brexit. Fifteen of the 20 least well-educated communities voted leave. All 20 of the best educated communities voted remain. So the status quo is not acceptable. The question is what to do about it. And what we've heard from the other side is that excluding lots of privately-ed-es-execlutely-eatism. educated people won't fix the problem. The rich will block the plan, that the rich will find a workaround, that instead of actually finding people who are meritorious, all that will happen is that this will mask other forms of privilege and injustice which continue to exist. And therefore, on balance will make things worse, not better. Those things may be true, they may not be true. I'm inclined to think they're probably not true, and if we have to exclude some rich kids from Oxford, that's probably on balance better than not doing so. But none of those arguments applies against an interpretation of the proposition that involves a massive increase in enrollment from all throughout society, doubling or tripling the enrollment of Oxford and Cambridge, taking almost all of the new kids from outside of the privately educated system, making these institutions open, broad, dynamic, inclusive, rather than hierarchical and exclusive. What you'll hear against such a proposition is that there aren't enough qualified people. Well, that's not true. The admissions rates at Oxford and Cambridge, just like the admissions rates at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, have fallen by a factor of two or three in the past 20 or 30 years. These institutions could admit two or three times as many people as they do now, and still have a class as qualified, as capable, as able, as it was 30 years ago, which was a pretty good class. You'll hear that these institutions can't afford to educate these people. That's also not true. The Ivy League today spends twice as much per pupil per year as it did in 2000. Oxford and Cambridge spend much, much more than they did just two decades ago, they could easily afford to educate many, many more pupils and do it well. Moreover, if they did this, if they became open and inclusive and democratic institutions, the education would for that reason in itself be better. As Dewey says, an education is the way in which a person comes to understand themselves and their relationship to the world around them. And that's not something you can do in splendid isolation. That's something you do in an open, vibrant, inclusive community, not surrounded by elites in a pressure cooker. And right now, what Oxford and Cambridge do is they distort the educations of those who go through them, and they distort the educations precisely on account of the exclusivity of their student bodies. Opening these institutions would bring new perspectives in. It would break hierarchies inside of them. It would do something a little bit like what happened to these institutions when women were admitted, which was also thought to be impossible because it would exclude men who were deserving. You know, when my university Yale first admitted women, it doubled its class, and the reason given was that they weren't going to admit any second raters at the exclusion of first raters. And so it was inconceivable they would let a woman take a man's place, so they doubled the class. But of course, what actually happened is they admitted many, many women, obviously, who were just as able as the men, but they also made the education for the men better. Because to be educated in an all-male place is not to be educated, it's to be distorted. And similarly, if we opened these universities to many, many more people, we would make the education for those who are here better in just the way in which past openings up of these institutions have improved them, made them more dynamic, more vibrant, more capable, better, more excellent, but less exclusive. Now, I'm going to close with another story, which I think illustrates the situation we find ourselves in. It's from the movie Jaws. This is the story of a seaside community that is consumed by its own greed, which is embodied in the persona of a great white shark that eats bathers. And there's a point in the story in which the heroes take a small boat. And they go out into the ocean with this misbegotten plan that they would capture and kill the shark. But the shark turns out to be so large that it swims up behind the stern of the boat and opens its jaws and begins to eat the whole boat. And at that moment, the heroes on the boat start clawing and scratching their way to the prow. And they're trying to figure out which one of them is going to get to the front first and escape the shark. And it's exactly the way in which our society right now is consumed by hierarchy, subordination, by inequality. And people are scrambling to get to the top, trying to figure out which one of us will evade this consuming beast. Who gets in, who doesn't? And there's a truth teller, the one person in the story who gets things right all the way through jaws. And at one point he stops scrambling and he turns to everybody else on the scene and says, I think we need a bigger boat. And that's what this society needs. It needs a bigger boat. It needs in Oxford and a Cambridge that admit many more students, that educate a much wider array of students, that has less competition to get in, not more, that focuses on who is educable, not who is excludable, and that brings people of all sorts together into a large community which is defined by its inclusiveness, not by who doesn't get let in. And if you interpret the proposition to say we should reach the 7% by admitting two or three times as many students and have the newcomers come from outside the elite, we can achieve all of those things without sacrificing anything that's particularly important and be at once more just and more efficacious. British universities like American universities have to choose between exclusiveness and excellence and they should choose excellence. And the way to do it is to favor this proposition. Thank you very much. Thank you.
