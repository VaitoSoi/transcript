 I now look to Sharon Chow, the chair of consultative committee, the largest committee here at the Oxford Union, to close the debate. that I am so incredibly passionate about. Before I start this debate, I must admit that it was a struggle explaining to my parents that I was going to speak to a chamber of 400 people about porn, so I must make this worthwhile. The main thing I'm going to be focusing on in my speech today is responding to the arguments that we have heard from our esteemed guests and speakers on side proposition. I'm going to tell you about how there are lots of misconceptions about only fans and about the autonomy, the power that you actually give to women, and what the reality actually looks like for the vast majority of people who use these sites. But before that, I'd like to talk about a personal story. So I grew up, well, I went to a school which only had boys until the age of 16, where it became a co-educational school. So a lot of the contacts that the boys had before the age of 16 with women, with women, girls with love and sex was through porn. They grew up in an era where there was an intersection and mingling of the new and the old age of porn, and I can tell you that they were absolutely awful to a lot of the girls that joined the school in sixth form. They were incredibly rude, incredibly misogynistic, incredibly objectifying. In my year, they had a ranking of girls based on how they looked, based on their bodies, and that is because of a predominantly objectified and sexualizing culture of women allowed by pop culture, by the mainstream use of porn. And that is why I think having mainstream porn in society, as we see it, even with the new era of porn, which incidentally makes it much more acceptable for people to use porn to consume porn, is so incredibly harmful to women and to everyone in the world. So, responses to some of the arguments we've heard from side proposition. From the first speaker, we first heard the argument about autonomy and control. The idea that through only fans, content creators have a lot of choice in their content, they get to control how it's produced, and also the profits that they gain from this. They paint a very rosy picture of taking photos of oneself during lockdown in their bedroom and how empowering that can be. Firstly, we think mostly a lot of these content creators go into OnlyFans thinking they can have absolute control over this content, right? They think they can produce content they like, the content they enjoy and they feel empowered by. The harsh reality is they get sucked into this, and then they have to tailor to people who ask them for increasingly unreasonable things. They get people who ask them for feedpicks, and then increasingly explicit photos, asking them to put foreign objects into different parts of their body. This is, unfortunately, a reality we see with a lot of OnlyFans creators. And this is crucially harmful because OnlyFans is a paid subscription service, right? Compared to a lot of mainstream porn sites where people can access porn for free at the click of a button. Why would they pay so much every single month to see a content creator? It's because they can get content that's curated to their own taste. And that's why it's so incredibly harmful for them to have OnlyFans and to have this platform for them, right? We think this is especially bad when there's a buyer-seller relationship that also happens on OnlyFans. When the buyer is always right, right? They are the ones paying for this content. They have the right to demand anything they want from the creator. And we think this is a far cry from the very empowering characterization we hear from side proposition. Yes. Do you not think it's perhaps like you're patchfizing to presume that these content creators that enjoy doing certain objects, upset, or off the she's. I mean, is it not perhaps? perhaps kind of condescending to assume that a content creator enjoy the sexual activity that they're engaging in and is actually looking too by engaging in on only fans or whatever kind of content cycle of choosing to buy in are actually enjoying it is this not perhaps you know something foolishly to assume that well maybe but I think that it's perfectly possible for individuals to enjoy doing a lot of these actions however there are two responses to this right firstly there are people who do not who actively do not enjoy this And you cannot assume that everyone enjoys everything they do on OnlyFans, and we have to care about these group of people who are essentially being coerced because there is a stream of revenue they now depend on through OnlyFans by doing these actions they don't like. And secondly, even for people who do enjoy it, I think it's great that they're able to earn an income stream from this, but there may come a point at which they are demanded to do things they don't enjoy. And again, this is a problem that can exist for every single constant, content creator. So therefore, I think this argument falls. Moving on to the idea that you get very authentic sex through this. So this was an argument made by both the first and third speakers on side proposition. I want to really, really question this, right? Because if they think realistic sex is having a paid-for, on-demand photos and videos of girls you find attractive, where you're able to scroll through millions of profiles of any girl you want to see, and then if you see that tickles your fancy, you can pay for them and subscribe for every single month for personalized photos for you. Newsflash, this is not real. This is not authentic sex and relationships. This is, in fact, an incredibly fake and very artificial version of what sex and love should look like. And I think that this argument completely falls. You create an incredibly false perception and warped perception of what sex should look like to people who might who might believe that purchasing it is what's going to get them sex. Moving on to what the second speaker talked about. She talked about Make Love Not Porn, which I think is incredible work, de-stigmatizing, celebrating sex, and debunking a lot of harmful myths surrounding sex. In her own words, she said, what Make Love Not Porn does is it teaches people the difference between the two, right? And I think this is incredibly important work. However, surely it's much better to have a world. in which you don't have to tell people, look, this is porn, this is bad porn, because the woman here isn't really consenting to it, because there's incredible use of violence, it's incredibly rough, and this is not what real sex and what real female orgasms look like, and instead, it's much better to be able to teach people what actual sex should look like without a lot of these harmful stereotypes that are perpetuated every single day by the use of mainstream porn, right? because the unfortunate reality is there are far more people watching mainstream porn unthinkingly every single day than people who actively seek out such resources that tell them what actual sex and love should look like. So the comparative here is not between they're having porn and teaching people that this is bad. The comparative is we remove porn and we are able to get rid of a lot of these unthinking kind of stereotypes that people have when they watch a lot of this porn. Moving on to an argument that was brought up in the POI and in the subsequent speech about the black market. So the idea that the viewership always exists, and once you take it away from mainstream platforms, they're going to go into the dark web, and this is going to be much worse because it's unregulated. So firstly, how many of us actually do go on the dark web? Not that I expect a show of hands here, because that would probably be kind of bad, But compared to a person literally typing porn in their Google browser and getting Porn Hub, getting porn videos literally at the click of a button, even when you're not intending to do so. So for example, while I was researching, porn, purely for research purposes, I didn't want to watch it, but it literally just showed up on my browser. That's what I'm saying in case my parents are watching this. But basically, the comparative is, even if it is unregulated and it does go on the dark web, which is incredibly unfortunate, and is a problem that faces basically every single thing that is criminalized in the world. It exists in the black market. The comparative is we remove it from mainstream porn. You don't get teenage kids who are like, ooh, I'm kind of interested about sex. Let me Google it, and the first thing they see is stepsister stuck in washing machine, or whatever, mainstream porn. porn tells you sex is about. When you remove that, you don't get young teenage boys actively going into the dark web, looking for rape porn, for example. And so we think the comparative benefit of this, even if there is some kind of black market that exists, is much, much better under our side of the house. Lastly, on what the third speaker brought up to this debate, she talked about reformed better porn, specifically porn that was made for women by women. I think this is an incredibly good argument, and I personally, no, I'm not going to talk about what I think personally. But a lot of people who watch this porn are feminists themselves, right? You don't get misogynistic men who objectify and vilify and sexualize women going onto these specific porn sites that produce feminist porn and watch them. You don't get them clicking even on PornHub the four women categories. You still get them watching a lot of mainstream porn. So a lot of these problems are still not ameliorated, even with this new era of porn that currently exists. And secondly, even if there is some sort of reform, most porn is still very much tailored to the male gaze. The unfortunate reality is most of the consumers of porn are men, and even if women do enjoy producing a lot of that porn, they do have to do it based on what male viewership likes, and this, we think, is incredibly harmful to women. Because of all these reasons, I really, really hope you can walk through the no door tonight. Thank you.
