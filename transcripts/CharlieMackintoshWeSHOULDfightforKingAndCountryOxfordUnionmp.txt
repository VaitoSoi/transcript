 Thank you very much, Mr. Ex-President. I hope the chair is as comfortable as you remember. Honourable members, when I first got involved with the Oxford Union, more than two and a half years ago in the depths of quarantines, lockdowns and pandemics, I always felt like that slightly too keen fresher with an odd interest in the union's history and traditions. So to be stood here as your president, speaking on a motion of such historic important to the Union and such impersonal importance to my future is a great honour indeed. Indeed, all of my time in the society has been a great honour, and I'd like to thank all of those who have been a part of it as I stand to give what is surely my last paper speech. I am aware, however, that you are not here to listen to the self-indulgent crap that I've just spewed out, and we shall save that for seventh week, eighth week, rather. You are instead here for debate on the motion this House would not fight for King and Country. 90 years ago, our predecessors met here in this same chamber to debate almost this same motion in the same format we continue today. And whilst I hope that the result tonight is rather different, the fundamental issue at the heart of this debate remains the same. Should this House and its members expect individuals to be willing to fight and potentially die for their king and for their country? The answer to that question is and has to be yes. But before I start my speech proper, it falls to me to introduce the proposition speakers in tonight's debate. Now, I do so with some trepidation, not least because of Mr. Galloway's fearsome reputation as an orator, but also because I don't want to be seen to be punching down on some of the most junior members of my committee. However, Izzy, from whom you've just heard, showed no such trepidation in insulting her boss, so the gloves are clearly off. Izzy is a first-year classicist at Baylor College and one of my most hard-working press and sponsorship officers. A couple of weeks ago, however, I received a random Facebook message from Izzy that read something along the lines of, Hi Charlie, I've come across a bit of an issue, and I was hoping to get your advice. Basically, both Olli and I are keen on running to Besecki's this term, but obviously it is ill-advised for two people from the same college to do so. I was wondering if there's any way around this. Being very busy, I forgot to reply to Ms Horrocks Taylor's message, but she later informed me that she had found a way around this. Or should I say a way around him? Regardless, when it comes to portraits and union relationships, as he, perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones. Furthermore, the portrait of her late Majesty of the Queen was not above my headboard, it was above my, on the mantelpiece, where His Majesty's portrait now proudly sits. Speaking second is Mr. Louis Wilson. Again, one of the union's most hard-working press and sponsorship officers. Now, Mr. Wilson is blessed by possibly having that holy triumvirate of reputational suicide. Having attended St. Paul's School, Louis decided to escape that bastion of entitled and opinionated men to expose himself to a whole new world by studying philosophy, politics and economics at Christchurch, Oxford. I'm convinced, I'm convinced that Louis, with his natural, patriotism and support for the monarchy is only speaking in proposition for one reason alone, that he is scared that he is too short to be allowed to fight for king and country, and so must ensure that no one else can. Well, good luck, Louis, you short king. Finally, speaking third in proposition is Mr. George Galloway, a former Labour and later Respect Party member of Parliament. Now, Mr. Galloway has been a public figure for so long, indeed he told me he first spoke in this House in 1986, that he is indeed in Michael Gove's presidential debate photo on the walls over there. But I was surprised when I was researching him for this introduction about how little I knew about his career. In fact, Mr. Galloway has represented not one, not two, not three, but four different constituencies in the House of Commons. It's no wonder it doesn't want to fight for his kingdom country. He's probably too busy still trying to work out who he's representing or where he's living. But I will give you a hint, Mr. Galloway. This time at least, it isn't Russia. These Honourable Members... are most welcome. Now, the proposition will try and portray this motion as this pinnacle of imperialist jingoism that has brought Britain down so many dark roots in its path. And I will address this in a second. But in fact, this motion is not that. Indeed, it isn't really what is he portrayed it as, because it's not really even about the United Kingdom or our monarchy. It is a motion about life, more specifically about your lives. The issue of the heart of this motion I think is perfectly demonstrated by one of my very favourite poems, namely Tommy by the Great Rudyard Kipling. The last answer of the poem, written from the perspective of a turn of the 20th century soldier, reads thus, You talk a better food for us, and schools and fires and all. We'll wait for extra rations, you treat us rational. Don't mess about the cookroom slops, but prove it to our face, that the widow's uniform is not the soldier man's disgrace. For it's Tommy this and Tommy that and chuck him out, the brute, but it's savior of our country when the guns begin to shoot. and it's Tommy this and Tommy that and anything you please and Tommy ain't a blooming fool you bet that Tommy sees In a break from Union tradition and committee that's the first and last time you'll hear me say that this term I'm not going to make three points in my speech In fact I shall make just one That to support this motion is to reject the existence of the society we live in And how you all live your lives For when the guns begin to shoot Our very way of life is reliant on those individuals those saviors of our country, to be willing to fight and even die for our king and our country. So what needs to be proven in this debate? Well, I don't think the opposition has a burden to convince any of you that straight after this debate, you must march down Mordland Road to the conscription office and enlist into His Majesty's Armed Forces. I'll leave that to some NAF video about being born in Glasgow or being able to fix a bike or something. What we do have to convince you, however, is that you should, and that you tacitly do, support the concept of individuals serving in the armed forces. not in some poppy-buying abstract sense, but that you fundamentally acknowledge the need for there to be individuals willing to fight for our king and our country. The overwhelming majority of you are not going to serve in the armed forces. And that's absolutely fine. I hope you will go on to lead very, very happy and successful lives, unless of course you're going to work at Goldman Sachs, McKinsey or Slaughter in May, in which case, get a life, you sad, sad losers. But by not choosing to serve In the armed forces, you are making a decision. It is a decision which is implicit in our society, and you'll almost certainly make unconsciously, but it is a decision nonetheless. You are making the decision to abdicate the responsibility for the maintenance of your way of life to other individuals. And you advocate that responsibility to our armed forces, to what Mr. Kipling calls the thin red line of heroes. Very few of you seriously believe that the status quo represents the end state of global politics. Professor Fukuyama has been proved wrong on that on umpteathe's occasions. The reality we have grown up taking for granted is rapidly dissolving, and more than any point since 1991, there is a real and ever-growing threat to the United Kingdom, both internal and external, threats that challenge the life you intend to lead. Banking during bombing, McKinsey through the missiles, or corporate law in a civil war, don't quite have the same appeal without the stability of the status quo. If you don't believe me, ask the people of Ukraine. I think when prompted, we all do realize the fragility of our own lives. But most of us, most of the time, do not have to think about it. Because it is safeguarded by their ever-shinking thin red line of heroes. They worry about it, so we don't have to. They fight for our king and country so that you don't have to. At the most fundamental level, that is why you must reject this motion. Because supporting this motion is to say that one should not fight for one's king and country because of one of two things. First of all, there are no threats to the United Kingdom. Well, I think none of us believe that. Or secondly, you must admit that our way of life is not worth fighting for. And I think this proposal is not one that many of you are willing to do that. If, on the first front of threats to the UK, the war in continental Europe is not enough to convince you, then spy balloons over our greatest ally should be. The entire system in which we live, dream, aspire and hope is one worth defending, and I hope you will agree with me. Now, one only needs to look back at the history of this debate to see that the point was borne out. When 90 years ago, this motion passed by a comfortable margin, our members were rejecting that. We were rejecting this notion that Izzy set out about blindly fighting for your king and country about the status quo being worth defending. And yet, what is sat behind Mr. Beloff, a war memorial to the officers of this society, who, six years later, almost to the man, went and fought, and some of them died in service to their country. And again, if that's not enough for you, look at the people of Ukraine. I think, however, the point that is, made, this imperial malaise point is one worth addressing. Because whilst I think it's a lazy straw man, it is certainly a convincing one. It is basically the argument that the King and Country argument can be very noble in certain circumstances, but throughout history has been used to persuade the young and the vulnerable to go fight for this sort of moral, jingoistic and imperialist cause, sort of militaristic opioid of the masses. And in fact, I'm wholly expecting Mr. Galloway to give us a moral audit of the worst actions that individuals in the British Army have ever committed in the name of King and Country. King and Country. The funny thing about this argument, however, is that it's entirely true. Horrible things the world are over have been done in the name of King and Country, and specifically in the name of British monarchs and the British state. There are two clear rebuttals to this, however. Firstly, an individual ascribing their actions to a motivation does not confer the blame for the action upon the motivation. To use a contemporary example, if someone protests a motorway in the name of stopping climate change and three people die in ambulances on the way there. It does not mean that protesting something in the name of saving the planet necessarily carries the moral burden of killing people. In the same way, claiming that General Dyer carried out his at Atrocious actions at Amritsar because he thought he was serving his king emperor and country does not discredit the motivation that others may serve their king and country morally. Furthermore, the proposition straw man represents a severe misunderstanding of the motion and a confounding misrepresentation of the nature of service. Service is an individual act. When Sir Tony Blair and George Bush decided illegally to invade the state of Iraq, they did not do so in service of their king and country, they did so for political reasons. The soldiers who were sent out there to fight their war did so because they were serving. Politicians make political mistakes, soldiers serve. And that is how it has to be, because the alternative is unthinkable. Would you rather your soldiers followed their elected government in service of their king and in service of their country, or would you rather them follow the pursuits of money or the political whims of their leaders? On the one hand, you have the freedom and stability of the United Kingdom, on the other, you have the military coups of Latin America and Central Africa. To give yet more time to my opponent's argument, I'm sorry, I'll take one or two more minutes, Tom. Let's take this argument to its logical conclusion. Do we support fighting in a kingdom country, well, that country is not ours, when we agree that the cause of war is wrong? Does our argument just amount to good soldiers follow orders? Well, to answer those questions, I want to tell you about what is possibly my favourite place in all of Oxford. Shockingly, it is nowhere in the premises of the Oxford Union Society. Perhaps less shockingly, it is also not in one of Oxford's many libraries. Nor is it anywhere in Pevson's perimeter of perfection that is the Radcliffe Camera. It is, in fact, a dark corner of the New College Anti-Chapel. There lies a grand memorial to the 228 fellows, scholars, students, choristers and staff of a new college who died in the First World War. It is not this memorial, magnificent though it is, that makes it my favourite spot in Oxford. It's because what is inscribed next to it on a much smaller, unlit plaque. The plaque simply reads, In memory of the men of this college, who coming from a foreign land, entered into the inheritance of this place, and returning fought and died for their country in the war 1914 to 1919. It refers to three new college alumni, who died in the Great War, fighting for Germany and Austria-Hungary. like the 228 inscribed next to them, they died fighting for their king emperors, for their countries. Do I believe that they were fighting for aggressive imperialist powers hell-bent on the conquest of Europe? Yes, I do. Do I believe that the war in which they died was wholly unnecessary? Largely, yes, I do. But am I incredibly proud of my college for fighting the Furore of the Age and erecting a memorial to them? Without hesitation, yes. Because that plaque, next to the grand 228 plaque, recognizes men as men, not as mere puppets of their country's political regimes. They are remembered as individuals who died fighting for the way of life they valued. By recognizing that they too died for their king and country, we restore them of the humanity that war robbed from them. As I started with a great poem, it seems fitting to end with one as well. Dolce et decorum est pro patria, Mori. It is sweet and proper to die for one's country. This Horatian phrase, carved into the walls of the chapel at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, make up the central theme of Wilfred Owen's most famous wartime poem. The sentiment of Owen's poem is exactly what the proposition our straw manning us is saying tonight, that we glorify war, we trivialise sacrifice, and we use rhetoric to send young men to their deaths. Of course it's not sweet and proper to die fighting for one's country. It is never sweet and proper to die. But the The sad truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that it is sometimes necessary to die for one's king and country, necessary to the lives that you all live each and every day. It's not sweet. It's not proper. It's seldom ever-glorious. But there is a thin red line of heroes, willing to fight and die for their country, fight so that you do not have to. By voting in favour of this motion, you're rejecting that. You're rejecting that sacrifice that others make on your behalf because of a duty that you quite justifiably have abdicated. So, before you walk through that door tonight, please pause and consider. Consider the life you live, consider the opportunities available to you, the hopes and dreams you have for the future. Then stop and imagine the horrors of war and the terror of oppression, the plight of the people of Ukraine. The willingness of our armed forces to shoulder the great abdicated duty of society in the name of King and Country is all that stands between those two possibilities. So, vote the way you act. Vote no. May God save the King and the United Kingdom, and most importantly, may he save those who save them. Thank you very much.
