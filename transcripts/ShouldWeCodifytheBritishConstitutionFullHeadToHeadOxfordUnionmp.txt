 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to today's event, the head-to-head on Constitution. The question in front of us today is, should we codify the British Constitution? Now, with the fall of Boris Johnson's premiership and the rise of Lestruss and the unwritten British Constitution has been arguably pushed to its limits. From the prorogation of Parliament ruled unlawful by the Supreme Court to Listrouss's proposed legislation allowing government to override, allowing government override of European Court of Human Rights rulings, the extent to which the British Constitution relies on convention and governmental integrity has been revealed. In turn, some politicians, scholars, and commentators have argued that a written constitution is a better guardian of fundamental rights and the separation of powers. On the other hand, critics of written constitution point to the United States, which arguably faces rights retrenchment and an activist judiciary. Would a written British constitution be a stronger shield against tyranny, or would it merely empower unaccountable judges and stymie positive societal change? To introduce our speakers for today's event, on proposition we have Professor Randy Bonnet. Now, Professor Randy Barnett is the Patrick Houghton Professor of Constitution Law at Georgetown University and is the faculty director of the Georgetown Center for Constitution. He has written five books on the US Constitution. On side opposition, we have Sir Robert Buckland. Sir Robert Buckland has been Secretary of State for Wales since July 2022, after having served as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice until September 2021. He has been the Conservative MP for South Swindon since 2000. South Swindon since 2010. To take you through the structures of today, at the structure of today's event, we will have opening remarks of 20 minutes from each speaker, which will be followed by five minutes of rebuttal from each speaker. This will then be followed by questions from the audience, so the audience questions have to be sort of addressed at both speakers. But yes, at any point, if anyone has a question or a point to raise, please wait to until we get to the point of questions, and then you can raise your questions. Now, I would like to invite Professor Randy Barnett to give his opening remarks. Thank you. I have my remarks prepared, so I'll be sitting during my presentation. Listen, thank you so much for the honor of inviting me here. I don't actually have a bucket list. But if I did have a bucket list, debating at the Oxford Union would be on it. So there's one more thing to be crossed off my imaginary bucket list. So before making a case for Britain adopting a written constitution, I offer three caveats. First, when I travel abroad, I never tell people how their political system should be organized. Being an expert on the American legal system does not make me an expert on the legal systems of others. And there is no single best form of government that will achieve good public policy while protecting the rights and liberties of the people. So I offer you my advice this wonderful afternoon because I was invited by this union to do so. And you knew I was an American when you invited me. My second caveat is that I am Heikian enough to believe that there is wisdom embedded in tradition. For this reason, we should not lightly mess with traditions which may have functions that we just don't fully appreciate. The burden of this debate, therefore, is properly placed on me to affirmatively convince you that Britain should adopt a codified constitution. Now, while I'm a proponent of tradition, I recognize there's also great injustice and error to be found in tradition, which reason allows us to discern, and I would submit that the Western tradition of reform, based on rational reflection, is responsible for the undeniable, improvement of the human condition over the centuries and the millennium. It was reason that led from the formation of the first anti-slavery party in the world in Philadelphia in 1775 to Britain breaking with tradition to abolish slavery in 1833. I count the American innovation of having a written constitution to be one such improvement that has proven itself over time. My third caveat is that while I may be an expert on the American Constitution, I am no expert on the British Constitution. Now it's true, I was an avid watcher of the original House of Cards and the Crown, which I'm told provides a thoroughly realistic behind-the-scenes account of Parliament and the monarchy. But I also confessed that I never really got into yes minister. So even my pop culture understanding of British political system is wanting. Now with these caveats to one side, let me now turn to whether having a written constitution is a good thing or a bad thing. It's my burden to convince you that it's a good thing. To be clear, I'm not going to be advocating that Britain adopt the American constitutional scheme as its own. Indeed, I'm not going to be advocating that Britain adopt any particular constitutional scheme. I'll instead solely be arguing for the advantages of a written constitution over an unwritten one. A written constitution is either a feature or a bug depending on whether it makes a governing system better or worse. My contention is that all things being equal, a written constitution makes a governing system better. In these remarks, I'm going to explain how. First, a written constitution is the way you can lock in a form of government. Now, whether lock in is a good thing, will depend on what the written constitution says. If it's a good constitution, a written constitution helps preserve it from being changed by those to whom it delegates power. If you like the British structure of government, the way it is, a written constitution is the means of keeping it that way, even when a transient majority of parliament thinks otherwise. Unwritten norms that have proven to be valuable over time can be more easily transgressed, precisely because they are unwritten. For example, by retiring after serving for two terms, America's first president, George Washington, established an unwritten constitutional norm that American presidents followed for 142 years. Then in 1938, Franklin Roosevelt broke that norm by running for a third term and then a fourth. He died during that fourth term. In 1947, this led a newly elected Republican Congress to propose in three quarters of the states to quickly codify a two-term limit for all presidents. In doing so, America then locked in the traditional norm that had been broken. To take another example, because our Constitution does not codify the number of Supreme Court justices, Congress may set the number. Since our founding, it has been as many as ten and its few as five. But for the past 154 years, a norm of nine has developed. In 1937, FDR tried to change this norm with his court packing scheme. At the time, his party held supermajorities in both houses of Congress. But his plan was repudiated by Democrats as pernicious and unconstitutional, thereby reinforcing the norm of nine with another unwritten norm, and that was the norm that the number of justices should not be changed to affect the rulings of the court. Recently, however, many members of the Democratic Party have become unhappy with how the Supreme Court has decided cases. Some have threatened to expand the court so a Democratic president can appoint justices who will rule the way they want. Once again, there has been strong opposition to doing so, including from prominent Democrats. Yet even the threat of partisan court packing can undermine the independence of the Supreme Court, which may well be the motivation for having issued the threat. If the norm of nine had been codified originally or in 1937, we would not currently be facing this effort to flout an unwritten norm, and we would be better protected from a partisan court packing that undermines judicial independence. My third example concerns rights. At the time of the American founding, the right to speak and publish one's thoughts was thought to be a pre-existing, pre-political, natural right of all persons. One of the most salient objections to our original Constitution was that it did not put this fundamental right in writing. As a member of the First Congress, it fell to James Madison to propose these rights be codified in our Constitution, not as any new limit on the power of government, but in his words, quote, for greater, caution, unquote. In his speech to the House, he observed, quote, if they are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardian of these rights. Now, our Ninth Amendment to the Constitution says that the enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. But this amendment has been all all but ignored by the courts. In contrast, the codified rights of freedom of speech, press assembly, has been far better respected than have the unannumerated rights retained by the people to which the Ninth Amendment refers. And our codified rights have been better respected not only by the courts, but by the legislature, and even by the people themselves. These three examples illustrate why unwritten traditional norms are not enough. Locking these norms into a written constitution cannot guarantee their preservation, but codification can strengthen them and make them more resistant to partisan displacement. Therefore, far from undermining beneficent traditions, one of the benefits of lock-in provided by a codified constitution is the preservation of these traditions. A second reason for Britain to codify its constitution is to clarify uncertainties in its current constitution. Constitution. Written constitutions cannot clarify every issue that may arise in the future, but they can address issues where a lack of clarity has become apparent. For example, as you all know, the role of popular referendums in the British Constitution is unclear. This lack of clarity put the country through a great deal of turmoil during the debate over Brexit. Such conflict can be reduced in the future if the relationship between popular referendums in Parliament was clarified and then locked in. My third reason for a codified Constitution is that this is the only way for the people as a whole to subject those who govern them to a higher law. Now I hold here in my hand a copy of the written Constitution of the United States. For we Americans, this is not the law that governs us. This is the law that governs those who govern us. Only after those who are empowered by this Constitution take an oath to obey it, can they then make laws to govern us? Just as we cannot change the laws that bind us without going through the legislative practice, process, those who are governed by the written Constitution cannot change the commands that bind them without going through the amendment process that stipulated in this Constitution. to protect the rights retained by the people, no single player in a governing system should be above the law. In this, I would include the courts as well as the legislature and executive officials. There needs to be a higher law above them all. The only way I know to accomplish this is to put that higher law in writing. A codified constitution helps to bind everyone, even a sovereign monarch, to the law. When considering whether binding the lawmakers to a codified higher law is a good idea, ask yourself, was it a good thing that the Magna Carta was put in writing? How else were the barons at Runeh going to lock in the ultimate lawmaker, King John? Should they have simply accepted his unwritten assurance that no freemen will be taken, in prison, deceased, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, except by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land? was it a good thing that William and Mary had to sign a codified Bill of Rights before they could take the throne? Would it have been better to accept their unwritten assurances to subject the monarchy to the authority of Parliament? Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights did not invent the tradition that British monarchs were subject to the law. Unlike other monarchs, British kings had long been thought to be the subject to the law of the land, as well as the rights of the English people. Both Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights use codification to lock in these pre-existing but unwritten limits on the royal power so as to better protect the rights of the English people. To these examples, I might also add the British Human Rights Act adopted in 1998. If you believe that it was better for these rights to be codified, ask yourself why. Then ask yourself why it would be better if these already codified. rights were elevated to the level of constitutional rights so that they cannot be overridden by a simple majority in Parliament. Now in answering these two questions, you will be making the case for codifying the British Constitution. The only way to subject those who govern the British people to a higher law that governs them is by a codified constitution. Now I think the resolution before this House does need to be clarified in one respect. The resolution calls for a codified Constitution. To decide whether the British Constitution be put in writing or codified, it's important to define what a constitution is properly conceived. A written constitution is not just a writing that says constitution at the top. A written constitution is not a super statute that is just harder to repeal. A written constitution is not a list of policies. A written constitution is a framework for making policy. What is called the British Constitution is the British framework of government, and it is that framework that should or should not be codified. A written constitution that attempts to lock in particular policies, rather than locking in the way that policy is made, is not truly a constitution. So the question before this House is not whether to lock in any particular set of policies. It is whether or not to lock in a particular policymaking system. That is the proposition on which you will be voting. This framework can, and to my mind should, include the express protections of side constraints on policymaking called rights, or more precisely, constitutional rights. Given the nature of a Constitution, constitutional rights should not themselves lock in particular policies. Properly understood, constitutional rights are not mandates for policymaking. Constitutional rights are constraints on the lawmaking and enforcement powers of government. They stipulate that the lawmaking power be limited in both its ends and in the means it employs to reach those ends. constitutional rights address, in Madison's words again, quote, those cases in which the government ought not to act or to act only in a particular mode. For example, searches and seizures should require a particularized warrant rather than a general warrant. In looking over the British Human Rights Act, I would say that they all fit the description of constraints on policymaking. The only possible exception I saw was the right to education, a phrase that might suggest a particular policy of government funding for schools. But taken as a whole, I think the text of this right appears to guarantee equal access to whatever schooling the government chooses to provide, which is also a constraint on policymaking rather than a policy mandate itself. Now I realize that there are many objections to this proposal, and my time is nearly expired. But with the time I have remaining, I wish to address one concern, and that is the concern about the role of judges. To be sure, you can have a codified Constitution without judicial review, so the resolution before you does not require you to favor judicial review. But to be effective at providing a higher law to govern those who govern you, a written Constitution does seem to presuppose some form of judicial review to ensure that legislative and executive acts conform with the requirements of the Constitution. To be legitimate, what a written Constitution says must be good, but having a good Constitution only make things better if it's actually followed in practice. A codified Constitution cannot interpret or enforce itself, so it falls to some other institution like that of an independent judiciary to ensure that it is followed. Some may characterize this as judicial supremacy or ruled by judges rather than rule by the people or by the people's representatives. Properly conceived, however, judicial review does not equal judicial supremacy. Under a codified constitution, judging the constitutionality of a law will, in the first instance, fall to parliament. Should Parliament decide a particular measure violates the codified constitution and therefore declines to enact it, the judges will have no say. Only if Parliament decides a measure is constitutional, will the judiciary have any role. Just as it takes multiple people to launch nuclear missiles, or so we hope, it takes both the legislature and the judiciary to concur before a law may be imposed. on the people. This is judicial equality, not judicial supremacy. In the U.S., Congress tends to follow the terms of the written Constitution when it anticipates that its actions will be reviewed by the courts. For example, Congress tends to be more mindful of the freedoms of speech, press, and assembly, and the free exercise of religion precisely because these rights have been codified and their courts can be expected to protect them. And when courts do so, their rulings are given legitimacy by the existence of a written constitution they're enforcing. So keep in mind that the American Constitution does not empower the Supreme Court to be a roving legislative commission, making laws for the American people. It may only decide cases and controversies that come before it, brought by parties who have been directly affected by the actions of the legislature or executive branches, and judicial, litigation is not legislation. Under a codified Constitution, judges to our servants of the people. Judicial review can provide an independent intermediary to whom individual members of the public can appeal to assert that the legislature has exceeded its constitutional powers. Grievances of particular individuals are not well handled by legislative bodies. An independent judiciary in which individuals can make their case puts popular sovereignty above parliamentary supremacy. Moreover, a codified constitution is an important constraint on the judiciary itself. Israel provides a good example of how overbearing a judiciary can become in the absence of a codified constitution. In 1995, the Israeli Supreme Court elevated the 11 basic laws that had been enacted by the Knesset over some 45 years to the status of a constitution. It then granted itself the power to strike down new legislation that the court contended to contradict any of these basic laws. Israel's unwritten constitution provided no clear remedy for this judicial usurpation of legislative power, much to the chagrin of popularly elected Israeli officials. In my view, the Supreme Court of the United States has been far too deferential. to the other branches when it comes to enforcing our written constitution. The first line of my book, Restoring the Lost Constitution, reads, if the judges had been doing their job, this book would not need to be written. But the fact that our codified constitution has not been repealed allows those of us who wish it to be more fully enforced, an argument we simply would not have in the absence of a written constitution. Still, if American-style judicial review is just too much for Britain, its codified Constitution could provide for the kind of legislative override that countries like Canada have. I advise against this, but voting for the resolution to codify the British Constitution is not a vote for the exact same kind of judicial review we have in the U.S. or really any judicial review at all. To conclude, if you like the traditions embodied in the British Constitution, you should want to lock in these traditions by codifying them, and so you should vote for the resolution. If you think it's important to clarify some of the uncertainties in your current unwritten constitution, then you should vote for the resolution. If you think it's better that Parliament be subject to a higher law, that it may not alter at the will of its majority, such as those already codified in the Human Rights Act, then you should vote for the resolution. In some, if you want a higher law to govern those that govern you, then you should vote for the resolution to codify the British Constitution, even though it's an American who's advising you to do so. Thank you. Thank you, Professor Andy Barnett, for that fine speech. I now invite Sir Robert Buckland to speak in opposition of this motion. Well, thank you very much. I hope everybody can hear me in a hall whose acoustics can be somewhat eccentric. Eccentric, there's a word to begin. Many people think the British Constitution is rather eccentric. Let me give you an example of that. At the time just before my sabbatical from cabinet ended in early July this year, the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was under huge pressure to resign which eventually he gave into as a result of pressure from me amongst others. But if you remember there was a serious conversation about whether or not the Prime Minister would be minded to go to the late Queen and ask for a dissolution of Parliament in order to, in a force the issue with Conservative MPs. And wiser heads in the constitutional firmament dug up something called the Lassel's principles, which had been set out by a former private secretary to the King, George VI, back in 1950. Now, Sir Alan Tommy Lassel's, legendary figure in court circles, was not somebody who made direct approaches or indeed liked his name to be associated with anything said or, done in public. There was an issue about whether or not back in 1950 when we had that short period between the 1551 elections with a very narrow Labour majority under Clement Adler, whether or not there was an untrammeled right for the Prime Minister to go to the sovereign and ask for an election. And in his elliptical way, Lassels wrote to the Times under the non-deplume of Cenex. And in that letter he set out some principles about the constraints that are placed upon the ability of a Prime Minister to merrily go to the palace and ask for an election. One of which, well, there were three constraints, one related to whether or not we had a viable and vibrant Parliament. In other words, was there a majority in Parliament capable of carrying on? Secondly, was there a threat to economic security? Big issue back in 1950, big issue today. I think we all agree as well. And then, thirdly, whether or not there was another person within the majority party who could carry on and take up the role of Prime Minister without an election. Now, that's a bit eccentric. We've got to rely on a letter to the Times newspaper under the name of Cenex to remind ourselves of quite an important principle. But you know what? I don't think it matters where it comes from. The fact is that we've got it. And my essential contention against our noble proposer, who very nobly has assumed the burden of proof, Note that, ladies and gentlemen, he's assumed that, and I'm going to suggest it's the criminal burden, so you need to be satisfied so that you're sure, beyond a reasonable doubt, as we used to call it, that his case is made, that really you've got to first of all ask the question, the old wartime adage in order to get people to save petrol was, is your journey really necessary? And I've got to ask this question, is the journey really necessary? What is it that we have to be? trying to do here. Now there is a socio-economic argument that's put out. Now, to be fair to Rudy, I think he's been very careful in the way that he's coached his arguments. We'll come to him in a moment. But I do think it's important that we demolish the socio-economic argument in favour of written constitutions. There is no evidence, ladies and gentlemen, that the well-being or happiness or prosperity of a society depends on the existence of written constitution. Now, I'm not going to say in the United Kingdom, there we are perfect, that we live in Nirvana. But compared to neighbouring countries in Western Europe, all of which have, to some or lesser degree, a written constitution, most notably the Federal Republic of Germany, I really find that there is little, if any, evidence to support that contention. I do not think that fundamentally, written constitutions raise people's standards of living and do all the things that those who get into public service want to achieve, namely to alleviate poverty and to make life better for everybody, to save our environment, to do all the things that we care so passionately about. So I've got to ask the question again, is the journey really necessary? Now, two other points I think you need to consider when looking at this question. First of all, can we in the United Kingdom actually draft a written constitution that's going to pass muster? And secondly, are we on our way to one anyway? I think those two questions we should really look at. First of all, can we, is a proper question to ask. Because we no longer live in a unitary state. Since the late 1990s, we have now created devolved authorities, parliaments in Scotland, in Wales, and the Stormont Assembly. Are you telling me that it's going to be an easy task to somehow come to a UK-British norm, bearing in mind all the sensitivities that we know exist in Northern Ireland, surrounding the Good Friday process and indeed the obvious sensitivities in Edinburgh in particular, not to mention the sensitivities that I deal with in Cardiff. I do not think that the task is now rendered in any way straightforward by the devolution settlement. But more fundamentally, we don't start from a blank page. We're not a birth of a nation's moment here. We are, whether we like it or not, an old country that has wended and weaved its wonderful way into a position where I think we can safely say that we live in a liberal democracy, one of the most vigorous liberal democracies in the world. A lot of that was accident. You know, I reject the sort of whigish view that somehow there was an inevitable arc of progress. It's a dreadful word, sometimes progress. We've got to be very careful about how we use it, which was punctuated by Magna Carta, the glorious revolution, and the Great Reform Act. All these things were accidents. The Magna Carta was an attempt by John to get out of a tricky situation. He would assign anything in order to get out the particular situation that he was in. It wasn't John that made Magna Carta work. It was William Marshall and in the early years of the successor, King Henry III, who helped embed it in 1216 with its successor document. And then it was Cook, in the early 17th century, took it up as his shield against the wisest fool in Christendom, James I. And that's where you see Magna Carter starting to rear its head. And then the Americans got hold of it and fell in love with it. And thanks to them, we have the memorial at Runny Meade. It's the American Bar Association who built that memorial. I think it would still be a boggy island if it had been left to English and Welsh lawyers. It was the Americans who fell in love with Magna Carter and have given it, I think, a status that important though it is, it perhaps doesn't quite merit. And then the glorious revolution. Well, I mean, the only thing that was glorious about it was that we got rid of a rather incompetent king who thought that by dropping the Great Seed in the Thames that somehow his authority would be preserved. I mean, the mindset that led to that beggar's belief, but that's what he did. And we did end up with a settlement that meant, in effect, that the king could no longer really do much, without asking Parliament for taxes, couldn't raise his own army, had their powers limited in a significant way. But again, that was politics. That wasn't some arc of progress. And this is the fundamental flaw, I think, with the sort of rationalist case for a written constitution. But there comes a perfect moment that a document that tells you not what you want to do, but how you do it, can be brought into force and creative. because I can tell you, folks, the process by which you do it is a vexed one. I think the consensus would be that having a referendum might be a good idea. I've had more than my fair share of referendums over the years. And we all know it's the devil's in the question and how you ask it. And then a referendum perhaps to ratify it. Well, the great country of Chile has just been going through this enterprise. they all agreed by 80% of them said they wanted a new constitution but when the 358 clause 52 transitional provision document appeared they gave it a very firm raspberry in the recent referendum to ratify and now they're going back to the drawing board and looking at it again and they tried everything they tried a citizens assembly in order to assemble this great document and unfortunately the matter has fallen rather flat think of the energy and the time it's being spent on crafting the perfect document when in a fact they could be getting on with doing important things like fixing the environment, getting school sorted out and getting health provision sorted as well. There's so much in modern government that we've got to get on with that I ask the question about this, is your journey really necessary? Now, Randy's made some very interesting points about the US Constitution and I think he's made a very cute point about the Supreme Court and its numbers. I don't think numbers matter. I think it's what the court does that matters. And I'm afraid we cannot escape from the fact that there have been times in the history of the US Supreme Court when it has embedded and legitimized discrimination. I mean, Plessy is the classic case in 1890s, about separate but equal, which took two generations to overturn. We've just had an example this year. in the Dobbs abortion case about the problem of when things are not in the Constitution and what is not there is as important as what is there. And I think the lesson from that decision was that the court was very clear that because that particular right was not expressly contained in any part of the Constitution, then it wouldn't have as much weight as perhaps another type of. of Wright would have. And that there wasn't actually, in their reckoning, an underlying freedom or or civil liberty that allowed the creation of the framework that was set out in Roe and Wade. Now, I think as a matter of law, I think the Supreme Court were making actually quite an important point. They were saying to the legislature, look, it's your job. You should be legislating on an important tissue like abortion. You should be doing it, not the courts. But look at the consequences. Consequences are pretty baleful, I think, for millions of people in America who now find that particular right is either not available, it's either too expensive, or it's too far away, because of the application of state law in relation to termination of pregnancy. Now, that's a very pretty pickle for a court to get itself into. And I don't think Randy can get away from my central contention here, that try as you might, even with the common law tradition about the court answering the question that it's given rather than strolling across the savannah of the Constitution and opining in general, it's not a good place for judges to find themselves in. I think we owe it to our judges, our independent judges, to ensure that as far as possible, in their selection and in the work that they do, that they are not drawn into the political arena, which is why in the work that I did as Lord Chancellor, everything that I tried to do was to try and make sure that they weren't unduly exposed to those issues, or that when they were, their position was ultimately respected. And here's the thing about the opening remarks of our chair, about the prorogation case. The prorogation case was an example of the unwritten constitution actually working. What happened was the government decided to prerog parliament. It was challenged. The court answered the question that was put before it by the applicant. The government was found to have acted unlawfully. The government complied the day after and parliament was reassembled. We might not have agreed with the judgment. We might have argued against it, but it was respected and it was up. So again, what are we arguing about? Is the journey really necessary? Are we really in a position where somehow this unwritten constitution has unfurled and collapsed before our eyes? I think not. I think that one of the unchallengeable problems with a written constitution is its ossification. For a written constitution to work truly well, we probably need to recall some of the thoughts of Jefferson, who ideally would like to have revised it every generation. But then, I think it would have been a bit like painting the fourth bridge before they invented everlasting paint. The job would never, ever truly be finished. And therefore, the journey isn't only unnecessary. It's everlasting. And we spend more of our time arguing about the how, rather than about the what to do. I think that when it comes to our written constitution, Remember what Christopher Wren did when he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral. His grave is very simple, and in Latin it says on it, if you seek his monument, look around you. And that is what the British Constitution is. It's not in one place, but it is all around us, in living, breathing instruments. Whether it's the standing orders of the House of Commons, whether it's the civil procedure rules, whether it's the acts of Parliament that are passed annually and which are not entrenched, and there's a very good reason why I think they should not be entrenched, whether it's in the conventions that have seen us in one dramatic month through a change of government and a change of monarch without missing a heartbeat. I mean, I'm afraid having lived through this and been an eyewitness and a participant in these proceedings, I think that is an example of a living, breathing, vibrant constitution that does not need rationalism to intervene and somehow seek to gill this particular lily. And I think, in essence, when it comes to, you know, the common law traditions, there is so much more, I think, that brings us together as traditions than perhaps we give ourselves credit for. And I think, you know, Rudy's point, about the quality of judges is a well-made one. But it is undeniably, I think, the case that the status of the United States Supreme Court as a court that has stewardship of the Constitution and its interpretation inevitably means that the process of appointment to the court has become more and more political. And I accept that it wasn't necessarily always the case, but certainly in the last 40 years or so, probably since the rejection of Robert Bork to the court, we have noticed an insidious, I think it's an insidious and an inevitable march towards the politicisation of those appointments because of the perceived views of the judges. And again, as Lord Chancellor here for that period, I was extremely anxious and jealousy possessive in jealousy guarding the gate when it came to making sure that in this jurisdiction judicial appointments would not be made because of the perceived political views of our judges. I think that would be a very detrimental step. And my sincere worry is, by the introduction of a constitution, by dint of that, you will need a constitutional court, and that does me, I think, the danger then of politicisation of those very appointments. I've mentioned entrenchment very briefly, in the time that I have left, again, I take the point that the logic of having something to protect us means that you need to protect it by entrenching it in law. In other words, having a supermajority in Parliament before you can change it, or even a referendum lock, perhaps, before you amend it. Now, I don't like hierarchies when it comes to law. I like simplicity. And I like the principle of Parliament not being able to bind its successes. Why? Because Parliament's change. at every election, and they change, even if the same party might win a majority. I can tell you, of all the four parliaments I've been in, all of them had had a different quality from the last, and as we've seen, all of them have different views and a different approach from their predecessors. And I think that means that we are putting the general election and the electoral process right at the heart of our democratic decision-making. And there's something I find rather worrying about creating this straight jacket of entrenchment, which really potentially imprisons us or puts us, sticks us with, the views of maybe a generation or even more ago. And that's why I think in our country, one of the great things is that we can get things done. And we can get things done in a way that I think is fair, is free, and is democratic. And if people don't like what's being done, then they can choose the alternative as they so often do. And that's why I think entrenchment, which is, I accept the premise of Rudy's argument, is part of the essence of the argument of a constitution is such a bad thing. You don't elevate laws above each other. Let's treat each law equally. Let's repeal the outdated and the bad laws wherever we can, and let's promote the laws that actually change things for the better and get things done in this country. And that's why, in conclusion, attempts to reform the Constitution, particularly by the Blair government, which I think have led to a diminution in my former role, a confusion between Parliament and the courts, and a lack of fundamental lack of understanding of what is our checks and balances constitution as opposed to separation of powers, have the beauty of being simple acts of Parliament. In other words, we can repeal them without a super majority. We're not stuck with them forever, and if we should choose, we can get rid of them. And I think there is a certain elemental quality about that that I think is straightforward, is clear, and which emphasises the central role that the legislature and parliament still plays and must play in our constitution. Now let's keep it simple, folks. Let's read the standing orders of the House of Commons. Commit them to memory, if you like, because there, I think, are the bones of our Constitution. And for those who say, are we marching towards a written constitution already, I would say that because we do not have entrenchment, then that is not the case. But ultimately, ladies and gentlemen, I would ask you to reject Rudy's argument on the simple basis that the... The journey he wants to take you on is not worth the hassle. So please vote with me this evening. Thank you, Sir Robert Buckland, for that speech. Now we move to rebuttal's five minutes for each speaker. So, Professor Fence. Well, thank you, Sir Robert, for those. those very gracious remarks, I won't take too much more of your time in defending the proposition that I've been put forward to defend. I'm happy to assume the burden of a criminal prosecutor. I used to be a criminal prosecutor in Chicago, where you can see we have our challenges in our criminal justice system. And I should just say that having to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in front of a jury, I met that burden. every jury trial I tried in the Circuit Court of Cook County. So I'm happy to take upon myself that burden in this debate. But I think that it's interesting that Sir Robert doesn't have confidence that the British people are capable of writing their own constitution. He says, can we? Can we do it? I would say in the words of our former President, President Obama, yes you can. Yes, you can. If you wish to do so, you can. He also made an argument that seems to be somewhat at cross purposes with each other. Because on the one hand, he questions whether you can do so. And on the other's hand, he says, well, U.S. Order, you already have done so. Just read the standing, what was it, the standing orders of Parliament? The standing order of the House. Just read those. You're already on your way. You just have to write those down. But in fairness, what you already have is a bill of rights. You already have a charter of human rights. You already have a Supreme Court who is charged with enforcing the Charter of Human Rights, you're already well on your way. This doesn't seem like it's an impossible journey to take, and it's a journey worth taking for the reasons that I said, which curiously went unrebutted by Sir Robert. I made three arguments on behalf of a codified constitution. Did I not? I argued that, first of all, it allows you to lock in the traditions that you care for and that you care about, not to invent, using rationalism, the dreaded word, a whole new constitution, but to lock in the constitution that you already have. I heard nothing against that. I heard nothing why. If the British constitution that you currently have is so admirable, then why wouldn't you want to lock it in? And to preserve it, to preserve the tradition. Nor did I hear a response to my argument that there are some uncertainties in your current constitution, like, for example, the role of a referendum. Or devolution, for example. What is exactly the scope of devolution here? I think there is some disagreement even amongst the parties to whom power has supposedly been devolved. This could be clarified. It could stand to be clarified in advance. So that's an advantage. And finally, I heard no response to the argument that a written constitution is the only way to subject those who govern you to a higher law that governs them. A law that they cannot change on the vote of a bare majority of parliament with a single member of parliament. Parliament, I understand that members of Parliament are individually, extremely well talented and of the highest constitutional mind. And I mean no disrespect, but perhaps it should not fall to a single member of Parliament who makes a bare majority to change the law that governs them. And so having heard actually no response to the affirmative argument on behalf of a codified constitution that I made to you, that I put before this House, I would suggest to you that I have met the burden that Sir Robert has graciously imposed upon me of the criminal case. But if in fact that is not the burden that you, but basically you're going to vote on the basis of preponderance of the evidence, that I think clearly on any burden, you should vote affirmative on the resolution before this House. Thank you. Well, I like Rudy was a prosecutor, as well. And I spent a lot of my time persuading the juries in South Wales about the merits of my case, but I was a defence advocate too, and I used to do about a 50-50 case. So I know what it's like on both sides, but I still would contend that despite his excellent record in the state of Illinois, I'm not sure he'd cut it in a jury in Cardiff. But I will invite him one day to, perhaps we should both return to our former practices. He says, he says, that. that I haven't answered the questions. Well, I think that that's somewhat unfair because what I said about, are we on our way to a written constitution anyway, is, I hope, a negative. A negative, because none of the laws that we have are subject to entrenchment. Because part of his argument was that one of the important characteristics of making sure we have a higher authority to appeal to is that it can be protected against the transient whim of a here today, gone tomorrow of Parliament. I'm sorry, you know, a hugely elected body that's been elected by the people of the election. And for that time being, they have the authority to make changes and to carry out their manifesto and to get a programme through. So you can't, I think, somehow dismiss the authority of Parliament or indeed Congress. And one of the problems in the US is that because of the almost overwhelming dominance of this little book that he I think he does carry it around with him. It's not a red book, it's a blue book. That somehow Congress itself then, a part of the system that they operate, seems to be unable to make some of the big decisions about social standards in their country. I mean, take abortion. You know, we legislated on that 60 or 55 years ago. The British Parliament, the here today, gone to tomorrow, parliament, made a decision about it and created a law to allow it to happen. in certain prescribed circumstances, a law that has been amended and revised over the years, and which has stood the test of time. It stood up to the plate and took its responsibility as a legislative body to represent people and to do something about an important social issue, the same with a death penalty, the same with a home mirror reform on laws relating to homosexuality. All those things were done by a set of men and women elected for the time being to represent public opinion and the British people. And the British Parliament has time and time again stood up and done something about it. My worry about constitutions of the like is that they almost sort of disempower politicians to actually do things and to do things in a timely way. They ossify the attitudes of yesteryear. And there is no response to my point about the institutionalisation of Jim Crow. back in the late 1890. There is no response to that. There can be no response other than to say that that was an ossification that was legitimised by a constitutional court. Rundi's characterization of where we are in Britain is, with respect to him, wholly misconceived. The name Supreme Court in the United Kingdom is in many ways a misleading title. It is, in fact, the ultimate final court of appeal for the three jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. It's not a Supreme Court. It is a court of final appeal. It's not supreme over any other part of the Constitution. And actually, in its current constitution, the court behaves in a way that I think is entirely consistent with its role as a court of final appeal. It is a court that is properly respectful of the committee that needs to exist between the legislature, between the government legislature and the judiciary. and we're getting that balance right. We're not in the position where we have a constitutional court having to carry out a charter of human rights. It's not a charter of human rights. We have a Human Rights Act that allows human rights arguments to be mounted at a domestic level, but ultimately the convention is the governing document which we signed up to and are members of, but within which there is a very large margin of appreciation, which allows member states like the United Kingdom to go their own way, and occasionally we see those debates and arguments about whether we've breached the convention. But they are vanishingly rare in the case of the United Kingdom. The number of cases involving us before the European Court is tiny. And, you know, I often think that the issues about the European Convention are overblown when it comes to the political debate here in the UK. What does all this add up to? Well, it adds up to my simple argument that actually for all its idiosyncrasies or for all its eccentricities, for all its seeming lack of completeness, the system actually works because it's all there before us to see if we so choose. And I say again, the journey's not necessary. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for the speeches. Now we move to questions from the audience. Please remember that the questions should be directed at both speakers. So, yes. Could you please ask Mark? So I'm just interested to know from both of you. Obviously, a constitution needs to change. both an unwritten one and a written one. And obviously, if it's too hard to change... If it's too hard to change the Constitution, then you get ridiculously slow progress on solid, a big issue, so it takes way too long to remove three-fifths from the Constitution. But equally, if it's too easy to change, you get things like the Prohibition Amendments, where that really should just be a law, rather than something they put into the Constitution. So I guess what I'm asking both of you is how do we ensure that whatever constitution we have, written or unwritten, has an appropriate pace of change to it? Excellent question. We'll start with Professor Randy Barnett first. Yeah, I think that the questioner raises a very good question, and I think he puts it exactly right. You know, it's sort of the Goldilocks. It should not be too hard, and it should not be too easy. It should be just right. I think there's an argument to be made that the U.S. Constitution is too difficult to amend, although it has been amended when there was a national consensus to do so. I already mentioned the national consensus to impose a two-term limit on American presidents. It was done very quickly. The problem with amending the American Constitution has been that there has not been an overwhelming consensus to change it. There is one party that wants to change it, whichever party it may be at the time, and then the other party opposes it, and under those circumstances it doesn't get changed. But I do think that the U.S. Constitution could use an improvement. I think it should be easier for the states to initiate an amendment to the Constitution than it currently is, which requires the calling of an amendments convention, which people believe to be too dangerous to actually risk. But it would be better if the states could propose their own amendments, that could then be ratified once proposed again once by the state. So I just totally endorse the spirit of the question, which is that a constitution should not be too easy or too difficult to amend. I will add one thing, though. The very process of debating a change in a written constitution performs what contract law theorists refer to as the deliberative function. It actually brings the issue before the people for them to think, think about and to reflect upon and to decide where they stand. That isn't the same with unwritten constitutions, where it just happens. To actually put the matter before the people, even if it's through a diverse number of local governments, let's say, has a salutary effect. It causes people to deliberate, and it cautions them, it cautions them that something is about to happen. And it also preserves the final function the channeling function and the channeling function of a formality is that it tells you how to change. I don't know how you make the changes here. I'm not sure maybe in your answer Sir Robert you can address it. I mean obviously Parliament can do what it wants if leadership allows it to, then Parliament can do what it wants and maybe that's it. Maybe that's just the answer you just take a vote in Parliament. That's how you change your constitution. But I do think that might put it on the side of being taken. too easy. I think that might be an amendment that's just a little too easy. One last thing I just want to say in response to something Sir Robert said, and that is I don't necessarily recommend to you the congressional system that we now have with a Senate and a House that can't agree and supermajority rules in the Senate. I actually don't mind it, but I'm not recommending it to you. If you like your parliament, you can keep your parliament. That could just be in your constitution that Parliament can make policy by a single vote. What they can't do is override, for example, your basic declaration of rights by a single vote. That would be, I think, a modest change to your existing constitution, but one that I think would be salutary. Okay, well, I'll challenge Randy's last point about it being a modest change. I think entrenchment is an immense change to our way of doing things, and it does transmogrify the whole concept of how we as a parliament work, how parliaments do not bind their successes, you know, that I think is quite a sea change. I think the question, I agree with it. It was an interesting question. I think your point about, you know, why was the 19th Amendment, wasn't it, the Prohibition Amendment? Why was it passed? Well, indeed, why was the Second Amendment passed? You know, if Randy's argument is that this is a constitution about how to do things, well, is the right to keep and bear arms, something? Is that how you do things? That's a right, isn't it? That's a right to do something. So I'm sorry, that argument starts to fall apart. And this is where things start to go wrong. Try as you might. You might try and guard the gate to make this some sort of framework document, which is all about the how, but inevitably you start to see the encroachment of rights. And I'll give you a little example. The Johnson government dipped its toe in the waters in the last few months where my successor as Lord Chancellor introduced something called the Bill of Rights. Now, the Bill of Rights was designed to try and reform some aspects of the Human Rights Act. You can agree or disagree with it. I was in favour of some reform when I was Lord Chancellor, but it also started to introduce as concepts a number of very important issues such as jury trial that my predecessor wanted to raise as a right. And that was going to open the door, looking at the scope of the bill, to all sorts of amendments on guess what? Rights, rights to abortion, rights to ending life, rights to work, rights to a job, rights to housing. Now, these are all proper arguments. If we can have the argument about fundamental human rights versus socioeconomic human rights, and I'm a fundamental human rights guy, but, you know, this is the problem with constitutions. They start to proliferate. And no matter how much you might, you know, follow Rudy's Siren song about this being an enabling document already. In that great book there, a little book there, you've got rights that allow people to do things. And by the way, the Second Amendment was passed in 1791. So, you know, this isn't something that is a 20th century phenomenon. And, you know, I think fundamentally, you know, the problem is however hard or difficult it might be to change, that sort of proliferation is something I just think is unwelcome and just doesn't work terribly well for our system. Thank you very much. I think we're running out of time mostly, but we'll have one question. One more question. Yes. So I wanted to ask, so say there was a codification process, presumably through referendums, does that not give the British Constitution a sort of democratic legitimacy since we never actually agreed to the Constitution? Well, you know, I think I should deal with that. I mean, you know, who are we? I mean, you know, the generations, if you like, have an unspoken... I mean, we've sort of got here with this sort of unspoken bond, really, between the generations that we've passed on the torch and each generation has done its path, I think, to enhance... and spread liberal democracy. And we've done it through Act of Parliament. I mean, the extension of the franchise, you know, from 1832 right through to 1968, was a process of 130 years where it was sorted. I mean, for a lot of people, women in particular, it was far too long. But we did it through simple act of Parliament. And the idea now that somehow politically it would be possible to reverse that, I think, is for the birds. You can't imagine any serious political party standing up and saying, we're going to reverse the universal franchise. You know, it's just not going to happen. Similarly, and perhaps more controversially, with the devolved settlements, I think it would be highly unlikely that any political party wishing to get elected would seriously be able to say that you could reverse those measures as well. And therefore, I think that collectively, we've entered up in a position where, I think, as a modern society, we have got that sort of consensus because political parties presenting them to you will work within the liberal model, won't they? The liberal democracy model. And therefore, you know, I'll say it again. I don't think we need to do more to legitimize it. If we do, we'll need a pre-constitution referendum, I think, to decide whether or not we want one. And then we need a post one to ratify it. And there we might find ourselves getting into the same problem as our friends in Chile. Thank you. Thank you for the question. I did not premise my argument on behalf of a codified constitution on the basis of democratic legitimacy that such a constitution would eventually have if it were enacted by or approved by a referendum. I think a referendum of that kind or the participation of the popular vote is an important check on whatever constitution might be adopted and it might be the ultimate test of legality. But what makes a constitutional legitimate in my view is not that it got voted up, but what? what it says. Sir Robert's position is that the British Constitution, such as it is now, is a good one. And he defends it because it's a good one on its merits, which is what he should do. It's what any constitutionalist should approach a constitution considering its merits. I'm prepared to concede that the current British Constitution is a good one, although I don't know enough to be sure, beyond a reasonable doubt that it is. But I think that if it is a good one, it stands to reason that it would be made better if it were actually put in writing, so as not to be changed by transient majorities in the future, claiming democratic legitimacy to change things that would affect the fundamental rights of the people, even if it is only a minority of the people. And ultimately, that is the ultimate beneficiary of a real constitution, and that is it protects the minority from the majority, who otherwise can get their way, in pretty much any parliament, no matter how that parliament is designed. That is what our Constitution sought to do. It failed us, and I have to mention the Plessy versus Ferguson case that Sir Robert mentions, but notice what Plessy was. Plessy was a failure of the court to correct the legislature of the state of Louisiana. It was not a court interfering with the operation of the political branches. It was a court that refused to interfere or to a second guess or even to evaluate the rationality, to take European rationality principles, to refuse to even evaluate the rationality and just blindly deferred to the legislature of the state of Louisiana. That was a failure of the Supreme Court, but it was a failure of the Supreme Court to uphold the written constitution as amended in 1868 by the Republicans when they enacted our 14th, Amendment, which said that no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States. Failure to enforce the Constitution cannot be held against the Constitution. It can be held against those whose duty is to protect and defend the Constitution and who each and every one takes an oath to do so. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Pleasure. Before we leave the chamber, we'll vote on this motion through acclamations. So if you're voting on site proposition, then you'll, I guess, clap with your feet, I guess. And if you're voting in opposition, it will be the same. the one that gets more acclamation will win. So all those for proposition of this motion. So all those for opposition of this motion. And all those for opposition of this motion. Well it's quite a difficult one to tell from that. Pretty difficult. Can we take a draw? We'll take a draw on this one. Thank you very much for coming. We have the Game of Thrones, the Crown, and the Sandman actor Charles Dance, joining us later this evening in this chamber at 8pm. So I look forward to seeing you for that. But thank you very much all for coming to this event. Thank you.
