 Just want to make a few things clear. I'm an artist. I'm not a few things clear. I'm an artist. I'm not a basketball player, so I'm short in real life. That's one. And two, I want to talk to you guys and I prepared a little speech for everybody before I came in here. And three, I'm a little bit nervous because everybody's sitting down and I'm using people jumping. So let's get this thing cracking. Can we get this thing cracking? Okay, hold on. Oh, hold up. Bear with me, y'all. All right, here we go. Life. Life could be as enjoyable as a good film that you've been itching to watch. Life could be as mundane, like a job you dislock a lot. And last, life can be as grim as a post-apocalyptic future with no hope in sight. Curtis Jackson, most of y'all know, most of y'all know him as 50 cent, said, death gotta be easy because life is hard. It could leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred. That statement itself is often overlooked, but as we continue to breathe, that statement has proven true time and time again. I want everybody in this room to close your eyes. Okay, now I need you to imagine a punch coming at you. What do you do in that split second? Do you slip the punch? Do you avoid the altercation altogether? Do you strike back? Or do you take the punch? Now open your eyes. What did y'all see? What did y'all do? Did you slip? Did you avoid it? Did you take it or did you strike back? This is the way that life will come at you. Sometimes you avoid a punch, sometimes you have to take a punch, and sometimes you have to strike back with your own combination. Treat your life like a punch is coming at you. Because when you think life won't hit you hard, that's when it'll hit you the hardest. When you expect the punch coming, you have removed the fear of being hit. It can help you live your life to the fullest. What you're about to learn today is my struggles not as an artist in the industry, but my struggles as a human being in life. Hopefully what I say here will inspire you to take a different form of perspective to help you persevere through the trials and tribulations that you are currently facing in your life. So without further ado, I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Denzel Curry, but today you will call me Professor Zeltron. Thank you very much for coming to us today and what incredibly open open, opening speech. open, opening speech. I'd like to just start firstly by talking to us about what generally inspires you, as in what drives you creatively. What drives me creatively is just being the best at whatever I could possibly be good at, you know? And over the time when I first started, I wanted to be the best artist, just the best artist period. And it didn't even come with rapping at first. It came with just physically like actually drawing, like drawing on a piece of paper, you know, and trying to get better at doing that. And I was drawing more and more and more over time before I even picked up a pen to write poetry or to even write raps in general. So what drives me is just being the best at my craft and just being the best me I can possibly be. And the way I go about it is, you know, I got to start from somewhere. So I start off not being super good and just, you know, just trying to figure out and just trying to push myself as much as possible. So I think that pretty much what drives me, like just things that push me to be the best person I could be. That's amazing. When you first made your first musical piece, you were still in high school. And of course, that's a great time in many people's lives. You got, you got prom coming up, you got all the types of fun things and mischief to get off to. But making music is a difficult process. It's layered. It takes focus, it takes inspiration. What was it about high school and what was it about that nostalgic 64 that made you realize that this was a path for you and how did you cope with the competing pressures of life at that point in time? Well, first of high school sucked. The first two years I was at art school and you know rapping was just a hobby to me. It wasn't like something I took serious like how I wanted to take just taking art serious because if I wasn't rapping I'll probably be a cartoonist or something or making. or making like comic books. But after I got kicked out of art school, due to, I guess, I could have graduated, you know, on time if I would have just, you know what I'm saying? I went to my regular school, but they didn't really want me to. That's when I really took music serious because everything was just a hobby at first, like me rapping, me making raps, me making poetry, that was all hobbies to me, you know? And I guess me getting kicked out, I see my myself as a failure and then things wasn't working out at home you know parents separated my mom and my father completely separated brothers went to college couple of my brothers or in and out of jail raising kids that type of thing and music was the only option and I just felt like if I was gonna go all the way in I wanted to go all the way in and around that time that's why I met like Space Goes Purp and Mike DC and all these guys that like pretty much was in the beginning of the journey you You know, that's what it was. That's amazing. Obviously, family is a key part of us in life. And he highlighted how you sort of went straight into music there. If you don't mind, I wonder to what degree you feel comfortable talking about how Trey's, his death, affected your music, and perhaps your view on the US state. Trayvon Martin. I meant Trian Johnson. Yeah. Before my brother died, it was more so like when doing the Trayvon Martin thing that was happening, it was more so when I was doing stuff like strictly for my Raiders and being at Carat City when everybody walked out when they was like marching in the streets for Trayvon Martin just so they could get justice. That was like a part of history that, you know, that will always sit me, excuse me, that I'll always sit with me because I was there. I was actually there when that happened. And then when my brother died, it kind of, you know, that would always sit with me, that I was always sit with me because I was there when that happened. And then when my brother died, it kind of just, everything just broke apart. And I felt it. I felt what that family was going through. And it always impacted me to talk about injustices that was happening in my community and just injustices that was happening in the world as a whole because somebody that I know was affected by that. And it still haunts me to this day because I didn't even get a chance to say, I really love you, you know what I'm saying? Because that's my peoples. That's amazing. Your music has obviously evolved over time. evolved over time to some people it's a eclectic mix of different zones how do you think in response to what you said right now how do you think your music has involved in relation to the racial reckoning that's happened in the US um is there any relation to that from your perspective at all repeat the question how do you feel your music has evolved in relation to the racial reckoning that's happening in the US and around the world recently well obviously when I started I was really young so I was a super immature and I wasn't really trying to view the world. I was just trying to have fun like everybody else. Like a lot of these kids in here want to have fun with their life at the time. But, you know, and I was just going through phases trying to find who I am as a person or on this type of person, this type of person. But as I kept growing, you know, just looking at society as it is, it was like so much things to talk about. And I guess over time where I felt like I didn't have things to talk about, the world was there and had everything to talk about. So it made me want to speak on certain things that was happening in society. with police brutality, crazy school shootings, things that was happening in my community where it came down to like stuff like George Floyd, Trian Johnson, Trayvon Martin, also with things that was just happening in the industry, in the industry on men, the musical industry, you know, and how people are being pimped. I wanted to talk about it all and that's how my views started to change. It went from me just being like, yeah, I'm doing this, my neighborhood and like anime and this side and third to okay I still like anime but I'm gonna say anime less this time and keep going and keep going and keep going and Even paying attention to my feelings like I felt I'd never paid attention to my feelings before I would feel things and I wouldn't understand them now I do So it just gave me the platform to really like okay, I could talk about my feelings I could talk about the world I can just talk about everything with no holds bar and that's how my music ended up maturing because I thought people like the certain type of record so I would talk about my world I could just talk about everything with no holds bar and that's how my music ended up maturing because I thought people liked a certain type of record so I would try to chase that record, like trying to do Ultimate 20,000 times and it will never work. Trying to make Clark Cobain 20,000 times it will never work. Everything was unique to that feeling. So that's how my things, that's how things change. I mean, that's definitely the case. I think tracks on Melt My Eyes are not quite the same as Ultimate. And you really tease out this fever of self-awareness and trying to dove into your emotions in that album. Could you tell us more about why you had as a transition to be much more introspective with my eyes in comparison to them much more turned up or different times of music you've made in the past. Let me answer your question. How many people listen to music in here? How many y'all know me for yelling? How many y'all know me for loud music? Be honest. having to yell me for it like just shouting okay they ain't gonna tell you the truth but well just kidding but listen um when it came down to me making loud music like the stuff you hear on taboo and like ultimate and imperial i wanted to do something different because people already heard that already plus when i was once i finished taboo i planned out my i see a future As a matter of fact, I still have the plans from when I planned it. Oh, wow. Yeah. So I could tell you about everything that I planned out when I was doing it. There you go. By the way, it was in 2018. So when I first did it, it was like September 2nd, 2018 at 6.36 p.m. Yeah, I know. And so I wrote the title, melt my eyes, see your future. And the genres that I wanted to do was acid jazz, trip hop, R&B, jazz, boom bap, drum and bass, jungle, funk, neosol, dance hall, punk, and synth pop. That's how the project I wanted it to be. And topics that I wanted to talk about was success in music, wanting everything, losing my brother, being in a toxic relationship, being famous in mental health, my mom leaving. when I was 16, becoming a great artist, saving a friend from being homeless, a riff between me and my brother, living with my father, the cycle of hatred, education, sex addiction, finding love, women I did wrong, the future of Denzel Curry, politics and music, street smarts, being a role model, the old me, my religion and my relationship with God and family and friends. A lot of that stuff came into flourishing without me even noticing it because I forgot about this. That's deep. I mean, it seems that not only did you know what you wanted to do beforehand, but then naturally your subconscious started producing that. Do you want to talk more about your journey with sort of like quitting vices as you termed it? How did you find quitting, smoking and taking drugs? And what did you replace it with? I think we're speaking about this before on the phone a while back. Okay, with quitting vices, drinking, come on, bro. you're gonna look old about time you're 30. Like, that's one. Smoking weed, I don't have no problem with smoking weed, but my problem is I can't smoke weed by itself. So I would mix it with tobacco. I would spliff it, but I won't smoke a cigarette because I remember when my grandmother had throat cancer, they had to put the little tube in her throat and stuff like that. So she had the little hole, and that scarred me for life, so I would never smoke a cigarette by itself. So quitting that, I was just like, I can't smoke weed without. tobacco. I can't smoke tobacco without weed. I'm done with this. And after I did that, I remember somebody I was tweeting and somebody was like, he was like, I was saying some crazy shit. And somebody was like, what are you smoking? I was like, hi, I'm sober. And then I was like, wait a minute, why am I about to lie? Why don't I just be sober? It just hit me. It was just like, why don't I just be sober? Because if I go and smoke weed now, it's like, this tweet is meaningless. So I just stopped. And then the first thing that came to my mind was, well, my life's going to be boring. So what do I do to not making boring? So I ended up going into martial arts and been doing it ever since. Do you want to talk more about your journey with Motai? Hell yeah. I got, yeah, hell yeah. With that, when I stopped smoking weed and I stopped doing a lot of light stuff, you know, I still have vices. Don't get me wrong. I'm not a perfect person. I still have vices. But when it came down to the martial arts of, you know, just doing it, I just went in and I was thinking like, okay, I'm going to do this and this is what I'm going to do. This is going to be my thing. This is going to be my hobby. Because when I was growing up in Miami, my brother Trian, he's also a backyard fighter. Most people don't know that. It was a movie he was in called Dog Fight. And if anybody know who Kimbo Slices, you could go on YouTube and look it up, look up his fights. My brother was in those. backyards fighting and stuff like that so it always had something like I was always with him and I always stayed with me from when I was like a boy to when I grew up and so that's what made me go into martial arts besides the vices and like take it serious and I remember when I had all the nose rings and stuff like that I took them out because I really wanted to take it serious and my journey from that I remember I would get super good and then my manager would be like hey we're on tour for how long six months I'd be like yeah so I have to tell my own coach and be like hey I I won't be back, I'm going to be going from this time to this time, but when I come back on my train, the first time I told him that he thought I wasn't going to come back. I came back and I was like, what I missed? He was like, oh, we're only doing a one-two combination in the kick. And I was like, okay, cool. So I would get good at that, being there for like almost three weeks, four weeks, and then I would have to go back on tour again, be going for a month. Or come back, do the same thing, same process, be going for two weeks. Same process, be going for a day. Same process, be going for 10 weeks. And it will just have to be the same thing. for years to years and then when I hit quarantine where I was working on the album and things like that I started to really hone in on myself during the martial arts and I see myself get crazy good throughout those two years I was like just in there just been kicking people and shit. Wow so with your journey with martial arts could you tell us more about how that's impacted your sort of personal life but also more specifically benefits that I might have been through your mental health and your personal growth. Well, with mental health, man, it gave me an outlet so I could channel all that. You okay? You sure, though? You want some water? Oh, I'm gonna go, you're okay? All right. Just take the water, man. Come on. It's okay, bro. So the way martial arts impacted me, it was like mainly controlling of the ego. Like when I went in there, I had an ego because, you know, you're sparring all these people and, you know, it's not about winning or losing when you're sparring, you know. It's about learning at the end of the day. Same way you can do it anything. It's all about learning. And sometimes they encourage you to get your ass with because that's how you learn, you know? And just how it helped me with my personal life, it was, I was doing therapy and I was doing martial arts at the same time. was telling me the exact same thing when it came out of ego, when it came down to being more sensitive, you know what I'm saying, or consider it of your partner, things of that nature. And even with things like, all right, you're sparring somebody, and in my industry, it's very competitive as a musician. So when it came down to sparring classes, they would say don't focus on what the other guy's throwing. Just focus on what you're going to throw next. It just It's like it's not even about him. It's about what you're going, it's like it should feel like a conversation. It should never feel like an argument. So I will always worry about what I'm going to throw. Doesn't matter what he's going to throw, he's going to throw whatever, but it should matter what I'm going to throw on, how I'm going to block and what I'm going to do, how I'm going to get out the way. It's basically my answer to things, but just mainly focusing on me. That's how it, and then I translated that into me making music because I was always focus on what the next artist got, what he has, he has this car, he has this feature, he's on this billboard, he's at this number. And I was worried about them, worry about them, worry about them, almost to a point where I was jealous or like I hated the fact that they had that position and I don't, and I know I've been working hard enough, but it just came to my mind like, hey, focus on what you're going to do because either way to go, it's about you, this is your life right now. So that's what I learned from there. And And no one went to hit, no one when to strike. It's all about timing. That's why I realized a lot of things end up hitting on time because it's all about timing. And especially in fights, it's all about timing. Make one mistake and you're done, you know? Not even the mistake or bad choice. Yeah, I mean, that kind of like leads into life, especially with independent musical artists in America. I wonder whether you'd like to reflect on perhaps who are one of the most inspiring. artists or musicians that you've either lived with or worked with in the past couple years or projects. Is there anybody you want to talk about? Triple X maybe or anyone. There's a lot of people so I knew they was going to bring this up okay but when I was working on Imperial I had this house and in this house it was myself two of my own close friends from childhood their name is Shane and Shamis. Ronnie J. He produced Ultimate, he produced threats. He produced a majority of Imperial. And, you know, songs like sipping tea in your hood and like that Christmas project that X came out with, Ronnie J did that as well. And at this house, you know, we was making all the stuff. Twelve One was living there as well. My DJ for a brief moment of time. Just got in Freebase was living there for a brief moment in time. And people like Smoke, Perp and Little Pump will pull up to the house to and make their early music there as well with Ronnie because Ronnie was the one finding them ski masks will also come to the house and work together that's where we made space goes pussy and yeah that's where all the early stuff was made Ultimate was made in the house as well one of my biggest songs was made in that house and just working at that time you know it was just me and Ronnie at the time and Ronnie was couch hopping from going from place to place different houses and he will always be at my house and we will always make beats and you know I will rap on them and then one day I was just like you know you don't got a couch hop you could just stay at my house don't worry about the rent anybody that has a room in a house we'll worry about the rent just worry about like shit like lights and water like which we all going to pay together and ended up staying making beats there and started making imperial and throughout that time It was like late 2015. I threw a house party and X and Ski shows up. I had met Ski years before, but that night, that was the first time I met X because he came with Ski. Ski thought he was supposed to perform at my house and I'm drunk and I'm like, who told you that? Like, I thought it was some guy that told him that, hey, you can perform at my house because there's Denzel Curry's crib and stuff like that. So they came in. I confronted somebody. Really a girl told them to come. He was like, no, I told them to slide this and third. And it was like, so do we have to leave? And I was like, nah, y'all good. Y'all can chill. And then next thing you know, a friend of mine, his name is Chief, he left. I remember he went to this thing called CD4 and he's seen X perform live. And then he came to my house the next day. Like, bro, I went to CD4 the second day and it was this kid and he was going off and you know him. And I'm like, I know him. I'm like, who do I know? Like, I don't know who you talk about. He's like, you know him, you know this kid. Like, you know him. He came to the crib. I'm like, no, I was like, I would know who came to my house, bro. He's like, no, him and his dog came to the house. Matter of fact, I'm going to show you a picture. He showed me a picture. And it was X. And I was just like, I don't remember him. And then I just remember seeing ski a lot. I will always see ski wherever I was going. I was always seeing him. And I just remember running into them at a Kodak Black Show. Like, it was like when early Kodak, black stuff. We went to a Kodak Black show in Winwood and I ran to him. I was like, hey, you came to my house. He was like, yeah, you came to your crib, just and the third. And me and him was talking and I was like, yo, you got to come to the crib. I love your music because it was like a song called Fuck and a song called I Love It When They Run. And I love it when they run. I would run that back so many times because that was my favorite song. When I tell you I like some shit, I'm not going to sit there and lie to you. You know? And then I was like, yo, we got to link up. We got some things to talk about. He was like, hey, I'm going to do. Denver and then when I come back I'm gonna fuck with you he came back we got to the chase we wanted them part of ULT and he was just like I don't know you so is this a friendship or a business partnership and I was just like hey man I can't do business if we ain't cool you feel me so we ended up working together and then that's how all them so on started to come about like sippington yo hood and him meeting Ronnie Jay and them making what they make and it just was a thing and then I remember I was shooting the cover for Imperial, right? And I remember, um, ski came, because he was on, ski's on the cover, by the way, he's on the cover of Imperial. And, um, X came later, but X got into some trouble. So I remember, um, I remember what he got in trouble for. He, like, stabbed somebody or something, something crazy. He was, like, pulled out a knife on someone, and police was looking for him. Some crazy shit like that. I was like 20, 21 around the time when that happened. And I was like, stay out my crib, lay low for a while, just chill. And next thing you know, you know, you were staying there. I moved out. He ended up moving to this guy named Bruno's crib, and that was the end of that. But we still kept in touch from then, rifts and everything. And but pretty much, that's just a story of the ULT house. The ULT house pretty much was a staple for a lot of, like, Florida artists that came there. A lot of people passed there. And even Earl's sweatshirt came to the ULT house a long time ago. I met my current girl at the ULT house years before she became my girlfriend. Weird. I'm also I'm always tempted to go to delve deeper into that, but I'm still going to open up to audience questions. I wanted to talk more about, obviously if you like something, you won't lie about it. I wonder whether you listen to UK music and do you like what you're here? Of course I listen to you. Is there any hip-hop or grand artist that maybe come to mind that you really enjoy? I love Georgia Smith. I like Mahalia. I like, who else do I like? Slow Tile course. Quessie Darko. Boy better know, you know, JME, Skepta, Wiley, I like them, because I will always watch Lord to the Mic, like, especially when Skeptor was battling Devil Man. That's one of my favorite battles. Yeah, you probably didn't know. I knew all that, huh? What else? L.D., you know, with the mask, I like him. 6-7 gigs, just the name of few. So I do listen to UK music, heavy. I mean, I was going to ask how is the UK scene impacting the US, but obviously, like, I heard a 6-7 and LD first, and then when Pop Smoke started doing it, I was like, man, I was on this before anybody else was. Like, I was like, come on. And then I see Rocky working with Skepta, and I'm just thinking to myself about all of them times, like from 2013, 2014, when my homie free bass and lofty, they would come from Europe, they would come from over here and come back home. And that's why I got different sounds and like, why I like different sound of music, because they will always come back and play us some different shit. Like, I remember when they went to Paris, and then they came back and played this dude named Carus, and then he had a song called Charger. They went to London and he was like, hey yo, you should listen to this. And then it was LD and 6-7. And it was just like all them drill beats that you hear nowadays, I was hearing it from 6-7 first. And it blew my mind. And I would just always watch UK drill videos and stuff like that. That's incredible. I'm keen to open up the floor for questioning now. I know there's many people who have a burning question to ask. So, if you have a question, please raise up your hand and then a mic will be brought to you. I recognise the very keen member with the unfortunate football top. Yo, thank you, there's all. Can you stand up, please? Thank you for your talk. I wanted to point out, like, I think what differentiates you between other artists in the game is just how to you the game is just how consistent you are in terms of like releasing albums. So I want to know how do you maintain that consistency, yeah, throughout your music. That's a hard one, you know. I just have fun with it, I guess. You know, just go off the feeling the majority of time and just make sure whatever I'm making and how I package it, it has to make sense. And I just continue and just doing it, you know, I got a lot to say, so. Thank you. I recognise the member with a white top right there. Professor Zeldron, thank you very much. Your recent album, Mel My Eyes, you talk about like rough periods in your life and reflecting on those moments. And I was wondering in those tough times, do you find that you use it to fuel your creative process, or do you like hit a block and then if you do hit block how do you like overcome that and then you know go forward well i use it as fuel because a lot of the things that i've endured like i look back at it and i just like you know let me see what's going on in that situation and then when i see it over and over again i have no choice but to talk about it so i guess it does fuel me in the way the same way how it'll fuel mike tyson in the fight you know so i think When it comes down to that, I just let my past fuel whatever's going to happen and drive me to have a better future because I know where I came from. Thank you. I see it remember with an orange top right there. Thank you for speaking, Zell. It was pleasure. So we talked a little bit about how you went viral really early in your career with Ultimate. It's kind of weird through and through with the water bottle flips and stuff like that. I just wanted to ask, like, where you prepared? for the mainstream popularity of that song? And like how did you deal with that really early in the career? Hell no. And how I dealt with it, I tried to follow it up and it just wasn't working. So I just followed it up with some, you know, like, Imperial. I just followed it up with an album because the tape that it was on, people didn't really like it that much. So I just used that failure to drive me to making some like that and I think I was telling certain people like certain songs on certain albums were hints to how the next album was going to sound so I use the ultimate and just use ULT and stuff like that and just use the momentum of that and then use that sound itself to create imperial thank you uh what can I remember with the blue top here on the front row um There seems to be a bit of an issue in hip-hop at the moment where a lot of rappers are dying very young, be it through drugs or crime or anything, to the extent that articles are getting posted and people's response are, you know, oh, another rappers pass away. I wondered if as an artist you have any insight into maybe how this can be prevented, whether there needs to be a cultural shift in hip-hop or effectively like why. this is happening only in hip-pop and how we can solve that. I mean, I think it's pretty much the lifestyle that comes with it because the majority of the people that's like doing it, you know what I'm saying, that's dying, this young and stuff like that, maybe they have the mentality of not leaving their environment that wasn't particularly good for them in the first place or it's hard for them to leave that environment because that's all they know, you know, even when they have money and success, but the person who they're to the core is that, you know what I'm saying? Money doesn't change people. It amplifies who they already were. You know what I mean? So it's unfortunate that a lot of rappers are dying in their own areas because most majority of the time, they do die in the places they live in, you know, trying to escape that environment, you know, you gotta separate, okay, this is my old life, and this is where I'm currently headed. And I guess they don't see the lines because, you know, maybe it's not happening for them. Maybe it's just like, they're just so used to it and so deep into it that it's kind of hard to make that shift, you know? And it's just weird because that's how they are, you know. I think a way that people could just move away from that, maybe, you know, because in the black community is like no therapy, nobody preaches therapy or like getting help or like understanding traumas and underlining things like that or like even people who try to help. I think they should separate themselves and then try to figure out what's wrong with them. And then maybe if they figure out that, they could go in and do their thing you'll probably have less murders. And sometimes you got people on the internet and fans and rap fans perpetuating the violence that's happening. And even in the industry where all you hear on the radio is the same thing and the same topic and the same subject matter, I'm smoking on this person, on doing this person. They want that because it's exciting to people. You see it and you consume it and then you think like, oh, this is how it is what it is and that's how it is. So the majority of the time, people push it. It's not like they want to just be there. like majority of the time people push that upon people you know you know how many you know records do you really hear on the radio where they're saying something like really positive like going to college or something like I'm being serious you know like I'm listening there's like how many songs are like oh I'm at the club I'm with this I just smash this person oh I just I'm smoking on this person I'm doing all of this so it's not really the artist it's really the industry they're in that's pushing it as well. You got to look at it like that from that perspective. Just a quick follow up on that because you sort of highlighted something very important there. And one of my questions was to talk about responsibilities for these artists who are usually quite very young and actually highlighted probably have environments that weren't conducive for the most healthy habits or safe environments. But the labels, the old arts, those who are around them, make a lot of money from these young people. And of course, the content music is a driver of that. Do you think there's any responsibility or perhaps duty of care from labels themselves and industry icons who benefit monetarily from young artists to ensure their safe to ensure they encourage or at least prevent them from getting help. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Their duty of care to those who basically benefit from their lifestyle. Well, it's very fucked up because, you know, they are being exploited at the end of the day, but they know that's what sells. You know what I'm saying? Sex, drugs, money. It sells. It always sells. You ain't watching a movie, you know, if you ain't watching a romantic comedy or something like that, and you want to watch something that's good is like sex money and drugs. Like most people are like perpetuated with that because we live in sin. Like it is what it is. So they're going to profit off that and they're going to use whoever they use to profit off that and make money off that. And it's fucked up. They don't want, it gets to a point where it makes total much money to a point where if you get help, it might mess that up. There's an article. I think there's something like, I think, man, it was on the tip of my tongue. It was about Jim Carrey. It's like somewhat related. I remember I think Jim Carrey said he didn't want to get therapy because it'll take away from his funny. You know, it'll take away from him being like funny because he just, you know, unwrapped everything. Imagine if a rapper that was like living hardcore gets therapy, it'll be totally different. You know what I mean? Like the music would sound totally different. And I know because, I know it from firsthand because when I started going to therapy, my music started to sound different. And I started to articulate my. feelings better. You know, maybe they'll look at everything and all their traumas and everything that they've been through and then they start piecing everything together and now they have become a different person. The industry won't never want that, you know, because whatever they was doing already is making money and perpetuating a certain agenda. But that's all I could say about that. Well, so it seems that artists are stuck in that crash 22 because the incentives around them is not to help them, it's to allow them to consume themselves, sort of. Yeah, it'll give you everything you want. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying? You know what? To give you everything you want for you to not realize what's actually happening. Thank you. Um, I recognize... Red. Red. The, remember the red top. I thought my gosh. I hope I actually your question. Thank you so much for coming down here from London. I hope the concerts go well over the next few days. So it's really nice for you to come down. I had a few questions. I'm going to boil it down to one. All the stuff you're saying about therapy really makes me connect to Kendrick Lamar, obviously. As you know, the recent album is really about him going to therapy. But I'm not going to ask a question about that album. Because there are a number of masterpieces in his discography, and I'm thinking of to Pippa Butterfly. And on that album, he makes a song where he does this sort of fictional interview with a late rapper, Tupac. So I wanted to ask you the question, if you could do an interview with a with a rapper who's passed away who would it be dmx them it'll be dmx what would you ask him man it'll be that's actually hard to say i met dmx before he passed but um i don't know how many questions i would actually have for him just you know i don't know that that's actually a question i'm really stumped at Yes, it will be DMX. I would want to talk to him, but I wouldn't not know what to ask him. I never thought of me asking him anything, to be honest. I just think that we'll probably have a, you know, probably a conversation about lifestyles and hardships, but not really on how to deal with it. I think we'll have solutions for each other, I guess, or like probably answers that we both got to figure out. Thank you very much. Thank you. I recognize the member with the cardigan. And I made questions, my bad. I say answers, we've got to figure out. Questions, we've got to figure out. Good evening. First of all, apologies. We're going to go off on a little tangent from your opinions as an artist. So obviously you have a good knowledge of comic books. So this is going to be almost like an essay question, but it's a big question. Oh, here we go. Do you like the Marvel unit, do you like the Marvel Cinematic Units? do you like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and or do you like the Star Wars Cinematic Universe? So for example, are you watching the Obi-1 series at the moment? You talk about an Obi-One series? I'm waiting to go back home to watch it. But I've been watching The Mandalorian and I've been watching Boba-Fat. So those tools have been good and visions. Have you seen on Star Wars? Yes, yes, yes, yes. I love that it's like the Kirokurosawa kind of the feeling, so it's brilliant. I love those. That shit was dope. What's your favorite Marvel? What's your favorite Marvel? For example, Dr. Strange 2 or whatever. You know, I wanted to see Dr. Strange 2 today, but I had to do this shit. But let me tell you, when it comes down to, I think out of my favorite Marvel movies, it's out of Wolverine, Logan, Deadpool. Okay, and you're going to watch Dr. Strange 2 and then have an opinion, okay. Yeah, I got to wait for that. They already spoiled Spider-Man for me. Like, I seen Toby McGuire, like, you know, they spoiled that for me. What? Toby, what? Huh? Huh? Yeah, he's a sea biscuit. Like, to be like, Toby McGuire is a sea biscuit. I didn't tell you anything. But, um, I think, um, just going off of what you were saying, I prefer both of them, but I'm more of a Star Wars fan. I am a nerd for that shit. Like, not Star Trek. It's just a bunch of people sitting down on FaceTime. That's it. Like, Patrick's just doing that. What? Patrick's too. His whole career is based off sitting down. You see? He was Professor X. He was in American Dad. I'm pretty sure he's sitting down in the booth. And also, like, he's sitting down in Star Trek. There's never been a time where I've seen him stand up. Every time I turn to sci-fi channel, he's just like, yeah, we're gonna make this destination over here. You know, like his whole career is based off sitting down. I've never seen him stand up ever. I actually thought he was paraplegic. I didn't know. In 2013, Patrick Stewart came to Oxford Union. In fact, he's a regular guest, so he was actually standing where you're sitting at the moment. He's standing where I was sitting? Yes. So he wasn't sitting. No, no, no, no. But there you go. Nine years ago, he was standing. He sat so much he had to stand. Thank you very much for that question. for that question. A quick, quick follow-up since, you know, we spoke about your interest in comics and anime and would you have an interest perhaps into going to the acting industry? And if you were to do so, what universe would you join? I'm thinking of the power universe personally, but obviously you have different interests. Well, there's a lot of different interests, man. I want to, you know, I've seen this movie of Doom. Like, I've seen that. I wouldn't mind being a part of that universe as a Fremen. Like, I would just want to wear the suit and just be in the desert and just be a Frimming. Star Wars, of course I want to be in Star Wars, but I want to be a mandolian. Like, I just want to have the helmet and stuff like that and do the, you know what I'm saying? Or a Stormtrooper, because I could just die and just never do it again. Or, you know, because I'll probably be like too, too eager to be a Jedi. I'd be like, you know. But yeah, I would definitely love to get into acting and stuff like that. I would love to act in like dramas, but I don't want to do a drama that is just, you know, that is just going to be like, oh, the typical drama where, oh, he was the drug dealer and, oh, he was a basketball player with aspirations and stuff like that. I don't want to do those type of dramas, you know what I'm saying? I want to do stuff that's like, that you rarely see people of color in, you know, where you rarely see it so it can break the, just break the mold. Things like Dune, Star Wars, of course, was a Christopher Nolan movie. I love his movies. Martin Scorsese, I would love to be a part of those kind of movies, you know. And even like filming stuff, filming like good movies, or filming shows and doing them the right way. I would love to be just a part of just being in our director's chair of things because with certain things, I feel like we could all have dope-ass movies off of the stuff we grew up on. Like, I've seen the recent Power Rangers and it's terrible. And I'm like, bro, I know where, like, I know how to make. to make it to where it could look good and make it make it look gangster. But all that CGI and stuff, that's not it. Because when we was watching Power Rangers coming up, it was just, it was just fire because they was actually doing it, you know? Well, I want to direct stuff like that. I want to direct actual, be the first person to actually do a live action anime and make it look good because Cowboy Bebop was terrible. Not the anime, the live version, it's terrible. Don't watch it. watch it. If you're watching it, stop it. If you say it's just as good, go to hell. You know, you know, but I'm more so into like the whole film like I think I could see what other people don't see because most of the time it just be like a money grab to some people when it comes down to that. I don't mind acting. I'm scared to act because there's already a Denzel in acting and I just have to love. I have to follow that up. Like I have to change my life. I told him, I told my manager I was like, yo, if my By getting into acting, I'm changing my name. My name will not be Denzel Curry. It will just be Zell Curry or Dean Curry, like, or just Curry. Matter of fact, just Zell. That's like, just mark me as Zell or Griswold Gilliams. I don't just, I don't know what you're gonna name me. Just do that, you know. But definitely would be looking forward to getting into acting and voice actor. That's amazing. Looking for another member to ask a question. I recognize the member whose hands on the second role get you. Just wait for the mic to me brought to you. As the member, Oh, hi, you said used to art and you went to art school, right? So I was just wondering who's your favourite artist, and I also wanted to ask who's your favourite anime character? Favorite anime character is out of, is out of, um, Ken Shiro from Fist of the North Star, Spike Spiegel, Abitou, Yucheeha, and, and trunks from Dragon Ball Z. When it comes down to my favorite artists, I like Frank Miller. Are you familiar who Frank Miller is? He did Batman Year 1. He also did this comic book called Ronan, and Ronan was pretty much the inspiration behind Samurai Jack, and he also did Sin City. and 300 as well. So when you went out school, like what kind of art did you make? What kind of art? I mean, when I went to art school, it was just pretty much you had to do portraits, you know, like looking at the bananas and the grapes and all that shit. I had to do watercolors and all that stuff. I could do all that. It's just I got, before I could even like see my full potential, they kicked me out of art school. So I didn't really get the chance to like do it for real, for real. But I've been drawing my whole life. But what I draw now is more so comic book stuff, like just things that interest me. Like, you know, I like drawing characters. I like drawing myself a lot because I like to see like, okay, this is how I look currently, how I want to look. And that's how I envision myself. I would draw myself out physically, you know? And also, I've been working on this common book throughout quarantine. I made three volumes of it, and I'm finishing the fourth volume right now. So it's just been a lot. I was working on that in the album at the same time. So when I was, when I had writers block, I would just say, you know what? Fuck going to the studio, I'm just going to draw. And I would literally draw. I would put on documentaries about like different artists in the way they came up like Jack Kirby. He's also one of my favorites, Todd McFarland, which if you guys know who Todd McFarland is, he created Spahn. Do y'all know who Spawn is? Okay. So he created Spawned. And he's the reason why Spider-Man went from looking like this to this. Like, you know what I'm saying? And he made Venom, by the way. So, yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. I recognize a member with a bright yellow top on the press bench. Oh, that's R. Not yellow. Sorry. Cannot. Hi, thank you so much for the talk. It was really good. I have a question about, like, there's been a lot of stuff recently about artists and technology and like the internet and how it's kind of, like, especially TikTok. There's like this massive pressure from record labels. And I was wondering how you have like found the internet, like, do you feel like it's helpful as an artist or do you feel like it kind of inhibits creativity? No, it's very helpful as an artist. And, you know, it could help an artist by like, if you want to find inspiration that you never, heard before you can always go down a rabbit hole of things where you want to find the interest and then they'll show you wouldn't influence that and wouldn't influence that but as in pressure from the labels and doing TikTok that is very true they do pressure artists into doing a TikTok and they said hey yo we can't sometimes it be to a point like if you don't have a viral song on TikTok they will not sign you like sometimes I heard about it I didn't know it was real or not you know if your song ain't going viral on TikTok I don't know what to do and all of this stem from way back in the day from when Vine was out. Vine was making things go viral because it was just the same format, you know? And I feel like the internet could be very useful and it can be very helpful, but also it could be very detrimental if you spend so much time on it and not in real life with people that you could actually connect with. It's almost like you're walking unplugged. Welcome. Thank you. I recognize a member on the front row there with a blue top. Hi, thank you again for coming. This is kind of a follow-up question about your art education. I'm wondering how your background in art has manifested in your creative process for making music. Well, when I made my first album, I drew the cover. When I made through to Zelle Planet Shrooms, like me and a friend of mine from Miami, his name is Ashton, Me and him sat down and actually made the cover for that as well. Same with the cover for Ultimate. Everything that I did with my albums have always been art driven. The cover for Imperial, I drew that first, and I came up with a PowerPoint plan of how I was going to construct everything. Taboo, I had this idea of making three versions of that cover years ago with my face on it and I was going to use it for Imperial and we was drawing that out. However, it never came until flourition for Imperial, but it manifested itself for Tabu When it came down to like stuff like zoo, zoo was easy. It was just getting all the Miami shit putting in a one-swagging day. That's what it was. Unlocked, I remember drawing the own photo, sent it to my manager of like this character where he had the hoodie with no face and everything because I was really inspired by Wu-Tang Clan and their video on the mystery of the chess and boxing. So a majority of the stuff I drew out first. And when it came down to melt my eyes see your future, that was influenced by Blue Nubbush, like the artwork covers a blue note and like Japanese Gunding fonts and that's how that came together. So art has always been a part of the process. Me drawing things out was always a part of the process. Even drawing myself out like I told this young lady earlier that I'll manifest how I looked. I drew myself out through the era of when I was working on Imperial and when I was working on taboo. I wanted to see how I could change physically. So I had to draw it out first to see what I think look cool and what I didn't think look cool. So that's why I had like the blonde tips, the nose rings and all that crazy shit. That's really cool. Thank you. Welcome. Thank you. I've got time for about two more questions. I recognize the member with... Him. No, him. Okay. That guy. No, no, him. Right here. On the front row. Yeah. Thank you so much. You speak very open. speak very openly about things that you, you know, describe as failures and obviously to have put out as much music as you have. I'm sure you've had to deal with negativity and just sort of brush that off. And I'm wondering if you've sort of gotten over feeling self-doubt at this point, or if that's changed through your career, or if that still plays any role when you're about to put something new out. That would never change. I'm always doubting myself. I always doubt that something's good. I always doubt that I have the skills. and have the capability, but that's what keeps me on my toes when it comes down to actually making the art. Because if I, for a split second, be like, I'm good, I'm just as good as everybody diss now and the third. Like, you know what I'm saying? I will become lazy. And once I become lazy, the art will suffer. So I always doubt myself, no matter what. And it doesn't change regardless of what is critically acclaimed, what's big, and what's not. I always want to be like, okay, how can I elevate this? I always see like if I don't think this way I will fail. That's how I am. Thank you. The member next to you quickly. Thank you. I just had a question so like if we put you on Ox right now what song would you play and why? What song would I play and why? Hmm the first song that came to my mind was Ecology by um by Marvin Gaye. It's a beautiful It's a beautiful song. Just because it's a beautiful song. It's a very beautiful song. And the way the outro is, it's just, it's good. And he was talking about things that was currently happening in the world at that moment in time that wasn't really heard on on record before. Thank you. Last question from the member with the black top on the third row. Thank you so much, Sel. A little while ago you said that you were going to make a boy band with Slow Tie, Zillikami, and JPEG Mafia. Can we still look forward to something like that happening? It's a man band. Okay. Yeah, definitely. Actually, I was talking to Zilla not too long ago. I got to check in on Ty. JPEG, I've seen this man for two years straight. He pretty much on the same page. much on the same page. And you know, and when we first was going to do the idea, like, Slow TsoTie was the one who presented it. Slow Tso was like, it got to be me, J-Pay, Travis Barker, and Denzel Curry. And I was like, I'll do it if Zilla joins too. And Zillow's like, for sure. Thank you. The member on the edge of the forefell seemed very keen on you on. Would you like ask the last question? I have more like a music industry advice question. If you're like in an early stage of your career and looking to get picked up, oh sorry, just kind of, yeah. If you're in an early stage of a career and looking to like get picked up by labels with your band but receiving offers for solo work by label and managers, like what do you do? I know you're indie but like if you were in like a scenario like that, how'd you approach it? I would probably cultivate first, just like make it, make my music as a demand the way don't approach your music like a musician approach it like a drug dealer if you know your shit is dope people are gonna come people are gonna feed for it and they're gonna want more the more people that want it the more you cultivate and then you just travel in and just start selling dope everywhere else around the motherfucking world and I mean that in music I don't mean it as in like selling don't do drugs don't say drugs I mean it as approach it in that sense of mentality of like as a drug dealer like if you know your shit is hot then start marketing it the best way you can once you build that base then you know wait for the labels to come to you that way you have ball in your court and especially if you have it like a end or something then ball is really in your court because what can you do that what can they do that you wasn't already doing for yourself thank you welcome sweet um so that's all we have time for uh one thing we've been asking a lot of our guests uh this term giving us the exam seasons and many of people are young people who have big aspirations in life and are still hopeful of to achieve big things. In one or two sentences, could you sum up an inspirational advice that you give to our audience, members and members who are watching on Zoom right now? You know, if I think one thing that stuck with me, a friend of mine told me, he was like, most people don't know why they're advanced in life because they simply was not picking up the phone. And I don't mean that in a way of like picking up the phone as in, oh, your friend calling, you need to pick up the phone. I mean, and like, when God, if God's not calling you, you shouldn't be calling over and over. Don't even, you know, put down the phone because another call is going to come and maybe that's the call you need to pick up because that's going to guide you to where you need to be. You know, whatever's not working for you at the time, put it down because another opportunity is going to present itself. and you probably won't even realize it. Brilliant. Thank you so much. It's been a pleasure. Would you all join me in thanking Denzel for joining us this evening.
