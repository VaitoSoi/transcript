 Good afternoon, members, and thank you for joining us this afternoon. I'm delighted to welcome Professor Oliver Hart. Oliver Hart is a Nobel Memorial Prize winning economist, currently the Lewis B and Linda L Geiser University Professor of Economics at Harvard University. He is renowned for his work on contract theory, the theory of the term, corporate finance, and in the fields of law and economics more generally. Professor Hart, welcome. Thank you for joining us. Thank you, Molly. Well, it's a great pleasure to speak at the Oxford Union. When I was growing up in the UK, the thought of speaking here would have been rather unimaginable. But here I am. So many thanks for the opportunity. So I'm going to share some slides with you if I can master the... Okay, so that's even better, I hope. So in the last few years, I have become interested in the topic of corporate social responsibility, and I thought that would be an appropriate thing to talk about at the Oxford Union. So that's what my slides are about. And let me just start by saying that my ideas in this area are based on joint work with two co-authors, Eleonora Rocado and Luigi Zingales. So corporate social responsibility is the topic. I want to start with a little bit of background. I don't know how many of you are economists, but you may be aware that most economists think well of markets, a market economy. I hear you had a debate about capitalism last night and capitalism one. So anyway, that would be the way economists think about things that capitalism is pretty efficient, even if not always equitable. But there are some circumstances where the market outcome is actually not going to be efficient. And that's when there are externalities. When the activities of firms or consumers in the economy generate externalities. What are those? Well, an externality is something that affects people who you're not directly dealing with. So a classic example of an externality would be pollution. So a firm produces output and as part of that, it pollutes the environment. And that's something the consequences of that are felt by people in the area. And the firm is not dealing with them directly. These are not customers or workers. They are external to any contracts the firm has entered into. And that's what an externality is. And these days, unfortunately, we face a huge externality, carbon emissions that cause climate change. But, you know, it's the biggest one, but there are many other examples. Now, there's a broad consensus among economists that the best way to deal with externalities is through what's called a Piguvian tax that's named after the famous British economist Arthur Pigou. So in the case of climate change, this would mean a carbon tax. So every time you emit carbon, you're going to pay a tax. and that means you internalize the damage that your activities are causing. So that's the idea, the economist's solution to an externality like carbon emissions, but unfortunately, a carbon tax is very hard to sell politically. And here we're talking about not just a tax in a particular country like the UK or the US, but for it to be really effective, it would have to be worldwide. And that's really hard to achieve politically, even though we should be pushing, of course, for that to happen. Question, what to do in the meantime. Now, my view is that everyone has to do their bit, and this means companies and individuals. And indeed, companies or corporations are coming under increasing pressure to do something about the environment, to pursue ESG goals. ESG means environmental, social or governance and or governance. So the pressure on companies to be socially responsible in this area and maybe in all areas comes in two forms, exit or voice. So what do I mean these things, by these things. Well, exit refers to investors divesting from dirty companies, carbon emitting companies, let's say, selling their divesting, getting out of them, selling their shares, or consumers refusing to buy their product or workers refusing to work for them. So these are all examples of exit strategies. In contrast, voice. refers to shareholders using their voting power, their voting rights, to pass ESG resolutions or vote for directors who will pursue an ESG agenda. So when I talk about voice, I'm referring to shareholders because they are in a unique position since they have voting rights. Other people can, of course, make noise and protest and do this. kind of thing, but they don't have any control, whereas shareholders do. Now, we hear a lot about exit these days. Harvard has announced that it's divesting from oil stocks. I believe that Oxford has done the same, always in the same process. We hear less about voice shareholders using their power to try to push companies in a good direction. Yet, I want to argue that voice can be powerful and, in fact, more effective than exit. Now, because time is limited, I'm not going to actually be able to show you why it's more effective than exit, although perhaps we'll get to that in the questions, but what I think I can do is to show you how voice can be effective. So in order to do that, going to consider a real-world example. So in 1984, DuPont, the American Chemical Company, faced a choice between polluting the Ohio River with a toxic substance known as PFOA or incineration. So incineration would avoid the pollution. So that was the choice to incinerate or not to incinerate. Now, one can use court case documents because eventually, to give the game away a little bit, DuPont decided not to incinerate, to pollute, and eventually this caught up with them, although it took a very long time and they managed to evade quite a lot of the problem. But so the good thing is we have documentation coming from the court case. And one can use that to calculate the present value of the cost of incineration and the present value of the cost of not incinerating. So what do I mean by present values? I mean not just today's cost of incineration, but future costs and you discount them back and get a number in $1984. And that number is $19. million. So that was the cost. Of course, $1984 were worth more. So, you know, you have to multiply that by something to get to $2,22. But anyway, we're back in 1984. It was $19 million. The, what was the cost of not incinerating? Well, there was then going to be this pollution of the Ohio River, and that in time led to illness and death. And one can calculate the cost of that, putting some sort of value on life and this kind of thing. And you come up with $350 million in $984. So that was the choice, 19 versus $350. And of course, an economist would say, of course, you should incinerate because 350 the damage from not is much bigger than the cost of getting rid of the mess 19 of avoiding the mess 19 but as I say DuPont decided not to the question I want to ask is the following suppose this choice had been put to shareholders it never was DuPont management decided made the decision, probably just on profit maximization grounds, but supposed it had been put to the shareholders in an up or down vote. Now, I want to think of today's investors. So today, consider someone who has a half a million dollars invested in the US stock market. So that's someone who is obviously not poor by any means, but not wealthy either, somewhere in between. such a person, if they held a diversified portfolio, so they, you know, spread the half million over all the traded companies, they would own 10 to the minus eighth of the total US stock market and therefore of DuPont. 10 to the minus eighth is one over a hundred millionth. Okay. So imagine, as I say, imagine this is put to a vote of people like this. and assume that people are willing to vote. It makes sense for them to vote in this very simple up or down case to vote the outcome they want, not least because the only time their vote would matter is if they're pivotal, unlikely, but that's the only time it matters in that case. You obviously want your preferred outcome to be chosen. So, okay, this is all a long-winded way of saying, that you will vote the outcome you prefer. Okay, so let's consider it. If you vote to incinerate, if that's the outcome, then the company's going to have to pay $19 million. That's going to mean a reduced dividend for you. But you own only 100 millionth of this company. So, you know, 19 million over 100 million is 19 cents. So that's how much it's going to cost you personally. On the other hand, what is the, let's suppose that you are not only interested in your own welfare, you care a bit about everybody else. Well, who's everybody else in this case? So if you don't incinerate, then the damage, sorry, let me go back. Let's talk about what happens if you do incinerate. So I said there's this personal loss of 19 cents. But then as a somewhat socially responsible person, you care about the impact on everybody else. Okay, what is that impact? Well, there's a gain of 350 million because that's the damage that is avoided, right? So this is a benefit of incineration, that that 350 million, you know, which represented the health problems and deaths and all that. That's avoided. But your fellow shareholders are going to have to pay the incineration cost. It's going to come out of their dividends, right? And you care about them. I mean, you care about the people living by the Ohio River, but you also care about your fellow shareholders. And they're going to bear that cost of 19 million minus, of course, the 19 cents that you're paying. But we can forget about that. That's trivial. And so the effect on everybody else is that plus 350 minus 19, that's 331 million. So that's the social benefit from incineration. And as I'm, as I was saying, you're, let's suppose, I'm considering people who are a bit socially responsible. So you're going to put some wait on that. Okay, so at the end of it then, in deciding which outcome you prefer, it's going to be that trade-off. If incineration is the outcome, you lose 19 cents, but society gains $331 million. So what you have to ask yourself is, are you willing to give up $0.19 for a social, a net social gain of $331 million? Well, My point, and I'm praying I didn't. This wasn't quite as sharp as I wanted to be. But the bottom line is, I mean, how many people would not be willing to do that? Would not be willing to give up 19 cents for $331 million for everybody else. I think you would have to be a very hard-hearted person not willing to make that trade-off. And so the conclusion then is that if this vote had been put to, shareholders like the one I've described, the person with a half million dollars invested in the whole market. If the vote had been put to people like that, my view is that the majority would have been willing to make that trade off and would have therefore voted for incineration and therefore incineration would have won. So actually this is the pretty much the end of my talk because what I wanted to say, the punchline, the thing I want you to take away is that a profit maximizing company that wasn't thinking about future lawsuits. And I think DuPont at the time thought the chance of the lawsuit was remote and they didn't. take it too seriously. And so they were saying to themselves, if we incinerate, that's $19 million out of the corporate coffers, we believe in profit maximization. We don't want to do it. They weren't looking at the effect on everybody else. But so that's what profit maximization leads to, a socially incorrect decision. In contrast, if the decision was put to the, to the shareholders, then I think, you know, they would have each been saying 19 cents. Are we willing to give that up for this huge social gain of $331 million? I think the majority would have said yes. And so the vote would have gone the other way in favor of incineration. All this is to say then, oh, I think that is, okay, that is the end of the talk. So let me just summarize by saying, and I can get rid of my slides, let me summarize. The bottom line is that shareholder engagement can lead to very good outcome. So in my example, it actually led to the socially efficient outcome to incinerate. And therefore, if we allow shareholders to express their voice, this can actually push companies in a good direction. So let's have more voice. That's the takeaway. Back to you, Molly. Thank you, Professor. And I want to take the time to remind our audience members that you're welcome to leave questions in Zoom question function at the bottom of your screens. It makes perfect sense when you explain it like that, but how do you think we incentivize companies to listen to their shareholders more often? Yeah, that's a good question. And I think what I would say is that two things. First of all, some of this voice, it's shareholders can pressure companies to listen to them, even if companies don't want to do it. And that is happening. It can happen through shareholder resolutions. Now, in the U.S., this is a difference between the U.S. and the U.K., In the U.S., shareholder resolutions are not binding. So actually, management could still ignore them, you know, even if an ESG resolution passes. And not many of them do, but they are more now getting a majority. Management can ignore them, but they might decide that's not a very smart move. And so that's one thing shareholders can do. Another thing shareholders can do is to elect to the, board people with, you know, the appropriate preferences who are going to pursue an ESG agenda. And that has happened famously with a hedge fund called Engine Number One. Just a few months ago, they were able to get three of their chosen people on the board of ExxonMobil. Even though they had an extremely small mistake, excuse me, they persuaded other investors to support them. And so this is a kind of a punch in the face to the Exxon mobile management because they resisted this, but in fact these people won. And so they're on the board now. So you know, okay, so you don't have to have management wanting to do it. But at the same time, I think in the, you know, if enough noise is made, managers will realize perhaps that this is the right thing for them to do. So I don't think board members, you know, sometimes they actually want to do the right thing. And we're living in a world where humans are fighting against a battle sort of against themselves to prevent climate change. Many pimp the blame for this on multinational corporations almost exclusively citing these issues of incentives. In your view, is that accusation fair? Do you think that corporations are entirely to blame? Now, I wouldn't, first of all, I think multinationals can sometimes be part of the solution, because to the extent that they are kind of operating across countries, they can actually be more effective in doing something about carbon emissions globally, or at least in large parts of the world, than any single government. So, you know, I think I mentioned in one of my early slides that the carbon tax, you really need it to be universal, which means coordination by governments, which is very hard to do. Multinationals, because they cross countries, can actually pick up some of the slack. I think we're all to blame a lot of people, including economists, but others, for kind of pushing this view that the right thing. thing for companies to do is to maximize profit. It's not only what they do, but it's even the right thing to do. This is what Milton Friedman famously argued 50 years ago. And, you know, I think his argument was wrong. I mean, basically he argued that management's meant to act on behalf of shareholders, and shareholders want more money. And even if they're selfish, sorry, even if they're not selfish, they can always use that extra money to do socially good things. That's the right, that's how we should organize things. We shouldn't have companies doing socially good things. We should just have individuals do it and governments. I think that argument is wrong. And in fact, my example shows why it's wrong, because this is a case where DuPont was in a unique position to incinerate. And that's not something shareholders could have done themselves. And I think socially responsible shareholders would have, as my example shows, would have said to DuPont, please incinerate. But the Friedman sort of idea, even though it's wrong, has been the dominant view for the last 50 years. So companies have been able to say, look, we want to make money and people tell us it's the right thing to do. So now if we tell them it's not the right thing to do, I think they can perhaps behave in a different way. And in recent years, corporate social responsibility and the idea of companies being socially responsible as well as profitable has become more popular, sort of a buzzword, if you will. Given your work on the principal agent problem, how do you think firms should reconcile the social responsibility with this idea that shareholders may buy and sell their shares very quickly and only demand short-term profitability. Well, let me say two things in response. First of all, again, going back to the example, I think the example shows, I mean, whether you're short-term or long-term, if you're asked, will you give up 19 cents for $331 million? I think most people would say yes. which suggests that actually, you know, shareholders are not evil or totally monomaniacal people just want short-term money. No, they're, you know, they're people. They're you and me. And we're all, you know, most of us somewhat decent. So I think asking them what they want is actually can lead to good outcomes, not bad ones. That's the first thing. The second thing is you sort of hinted at the beginning of your question, you said something which made me think the following. A lot of people argue that it's win-win, that you can be social, that being social responsible is actually good for profit. Indeed, that's, you know, a lot of business people now say this. I think this is, you know, if it was that way, then the battle to make companies more socially responsible would be very simple because managers could just continue with this idea that their job is to make as much money as possible. And now they would just realize that being socially responsible is just going to make that even better, you know? But the trouble is it just, it couldn't, I mean, that's true sometimes, but it cannot possibly be true always. Again, back to the DuPont example, doing the right thing meant paying a cost. It's not win-win. It was a trade-off situation. And that's something we have to recognize. A lot of people refuse to accept it. And in 2016, you won your Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science alongside Harvard Professor Bainth Holstrom for your work on contract theory and discussing sort of increasingly relevant issues of CEO pay, your colleague argued that CEO bonuses are too high, causing them to take reckless risks and that the basic salaries should be prioritised. But given that the median FITZ-100 CEO was paid over £2.5 million in 2020, 86 times the median wage, why does it matter that bonuses are slightly cut when they are already being paid such a high amount? Okay. It's a pity we can't have my fellow laureate here to answer the question. By the way, he's at MIT, not Harvard. They'd be very upset to the thought. We would welcome him, but with, so the, can you just say again what he said, just to his, the quote you had, the bonuses were too high. Yes. And that led to reckless risks and that basic salary should instead be prioritized. Okay. Is that what he said? Well, okay, good for him. What would I say? I would say that by bonuses, I think he means, well, it's also, you know, shares or stock options. These would all make, they would be what we call, what economists call high-powered incentives. So you have a big incentive to increase profit. I don't think that necessarily encourages you to take risk, actually. But I think my concern actually would be more that very high-powered incentives can encourage people to shade on quality or safety. I've just read a book called Flying Blind. I don't know whether you know this. It's about Boeing and what led to the terrible crashes, which killed a lot of people. And it was, you know, they had this new plane with complicated mechanisms in it. And I think either something went wrong with them with them or the pilots didn't know how to operate them. And the question was, you know, who should have trained or provided the training manuals? And I think the bottom line of the book is that there's a lot of fault at Boeing. And it came from a cost-cutting culture. So people were incentivized. This was a shift. It didn't used to be that way in Boeing. But then there was a shift and people were rewarded for cutting costs, which is the sort of bonus issue. So I think that can definitely have negative consequences. In fact, banked, my fellow laureate has written a wrote a famous article on this on exactly the sort of thing I'm talking about, that if you have too high powered incentives on one dimension, you're going to cut activities on, actions on another, in this case, safety. So I think that one really has to take account of that. And sometimes it is indeed better to have something closer to a fixed salary. And I think the same would be true now if we consider what I've been talking about today. If we think that things like environmental harm are important and we want to try to reduce it, then having managers highly incentivized to make money is going to go again. against that. And so that's another reason to cut back on these high on the bonuses. And moving on to your own work, you give the example of the failure of private contracts in the US prison system, which caused a deterioration of quality as private firms said to incentives at cost. In the prison system, how can you be sure that a government alternative doesn't lead to the sort of off-sighted extreme inefficiencies in its operation? Do you think that governments can develop and deliver better prison systems? Well, actually, that was a good segue, because it's the same issue about, it's not quite the same, but it's very close to the idea that, you know, private prisons, if private companies run prisons, they're going to be putting a lot of weight on profit. cutting back on safety and not training guards properly or hiring guards who are not, don't have the right skills. This is what we argued in our paper. Under government operation, we would expect, and we go into this in more detail, but basically people are going to be more on just flat wages, flat fixed salaries, and that's going to, give them less incentive to under train guards and this kind of thing. And this is the trade-off. So, I mean, one response to what you said is that actually having sort of inefficient government can sometimes be a good thing because, yes, the inefficiencies is unfortunate. But at least they're not pushing very hard on, you know, one thing which might have bad consequences for other things. So, yes, sometimes sort of laziness may be second best optimal. But I also think, I mean, we can try to do something about government inefficiency. We can also, I think, try to write better contracts with private providers. So, you know, there are alternative. One thing you would do is you could have a non-profit private company run a prison. You know, a bit like, you know, non-profit schools, Eaton, or Oxford, for that matter, can be thought of as a non-profit institution. And those, you know, if you had a non-profit company running a prison, their incentive to cut costs would also be low. And so you might be able to solve the problem that way and perhaps not have the sort of inefficiency you're talking about. this is by the way, wasn't in our paper, but it's part of my more recent thinking. Well, it's very relevant to the conversations that are happening now. Receiving a Nobel Prize is one of the greatest honors that economists can achieve. What was that experience like for you? And how do you hope to inspire other economists? It was a wonderful experience, I have to say. I mean, it was incredibly exciting to receive the phone call at 5.02am. And, you know, the world changed for me. You wouldn't have invited me to speak at the Oxford Union without the... You see, in order to fulfill my childhood dream, I had to win the Nobel Prize in order to be invited to the Oxford Union. So it changed my life. mostly in a very positive way. There are some negatives. Actually, you do spend quite a lot of time thinking about whether you deserved it. I have, I have. So, you know, there can be some stress. But on the whole, it's been wonderful. And you ask me how I would inspire economists. I don't really think I can be that. inspirational, frankly. I would like to think they would be interested in the work and carry it forward. But we'll see. Well, I have some more questions on your work for those who may well be inspired at listening today. You previously spoken about control rights and how they're fundamental in contract theory. would you be able to give a brief, I suppose, overview of control rights and following on from that, do you think the lack of awareness about their impact means that more exploitation occurs? Okay, the first, so examples, well, let me give two quick examples. I mean, the basic idea is that in a situation where contracts are incomplete, so they leave stuff out, which is pretty much always, there's going to be some discretion left over and who has the right to make those discretionary decisions matters. So an example, let's go back to prisons since we've talked about that. If some situation arose in a prison and there was some discretion involved. So it might be one example would be hiring the next round of guards. Let's make it very simple because we talked about that. So who gets to do that? absent, now there could be some provision in the contract about how that happens, but absent that, it would be the owner, you know, whoever owns the company running the prison, who would make that decision. So if it's a private company, then the private provider would have a lot of discretion about how to do this round of hiring. And if it was a government owned, then the warden or whoever is acting on behalf of the government would have that discretion. So we argue that it makes a difference because if the government controls that decision, they can make sure that inappropriate guards are not hired. So another example, so the questioner suggested that people don't know about this very much, But if you take, so my next example is one where they certainly do, founders of startup. So suppose, and who knows, some of you may be, you have an idea and how do you finance it? Well, often through venture capitalists. So you have a contract. And people spend a lot of time talking. The thing that first comes to their mind with that contract is how are they, the financial rewards going to be divided up between the founder and the investors. And this is stressed in TV shows on these things. But there's another part of it, the contract, which is very important, and people recognize to be important. And that's the allocation of control rights between the two groups, the founder, the group on the one hand, and the investors on the other. So this boils down to, for example, who's going to be on the board? How many people on the board will the founder be able to choose and how many people will the investors choose? So maybe they'll have some people who are independent to sort of round things out. So why does that matter? Because decisions have to be made about this company, you know, all the time and for years going forward. and the question is who's going to make those decisions? Who, for example, is going to decide whether the, let's say the founder is the CEO at the beginning, but at some point later on, maybe some of the people think that he or she should be replaced. Who gets to make that decision? Who has the majority on the board? That's an important, I think, a very real, worldly example of control and how it matters. Now, the last bit was about exploitation. That bit I'm not quite sure about. But let me just say it is certainly possible that, you know, you join a firm and at some point the firm instructs you to do something. And you may not realize that they could really do that. Of course, you always have maybe if you'd known that, you would have not taken that job. job. At the same time, of course, you can always quit. So in a way, that kind of authority is a bit limited. But if your alternative prospects are not good, then maybe quitting is very unattractive. And so you're sort of somewhat locked in. And then their ability to tell you what to do might be more than you understood going in. I've spoken about climate change, speaking about prison reform. Do you find yourself drawn to areas of economics which reflect the wider political conversations that we're having at the moment, or has that been a sort of happy accident? That's a very good question. The answer is very simple. It's been pretty much a happy accent for me, or perhaps another way to say it, it's been a sort of evolution, because I started off very much as an economic theorist, and, you know, to be honest, I knew very little about reality. And, yes, and it was challenging. Some sort of facts were quite challenging for me. I did my first degree in mathematics. So I was always somewhat of an abstract thinker. And when I moved into economics, it was the abstract parts of it that appealed to me. And it's only over time that I've, A, become a bit more worldly and B, seen how some of my ideas can be applied and also realized the importance of starting with new work. I mean, with existing theory, you can just take what other people have done and extended it in various ways. You don't really have to know that much about the world, how the world works. But if you want to do something new, then it's, I realize that often the best way is to think of some phenomenon out there in the world that isn't well understood and tried to develop a theory to explain that. And so that's what I moved to doing. And for that, you need to be more connected to the world. Well, I'm keen to make time for some audience questions. Our first one is from Oscar Wasilik from St. Hughes. He asked, do you believe institutions should exist for calculating externalities? Well, we do have it. I'm not quite sure that. I mean, governments calculate externalities sometimes. And we also have people in Europe. universities calculate the costs of climate change and come up with numbers about the appropriate carbon tax. You know, what should the tax be? And I mean, the estimates differ widely. That's one of the things you'll have, you know, one academic saying this, one academic saying something else. an institute. We have various private institutions. Then we have, you know, you have something like the Stern Report, if you remember that, which was Nick Stern produced and, but under the auspices of the UK government. And that had lots of numbers in it. So I think there's a, there are lots of places that can do it. And of course, businesses also do it, but there one might be a little more suspicious of their motives. And we have anonymous question who says, good afternoon. If you look at the agro-industrial sector from an economic point of view, can you see that the agro-industrial sector is becoming more environmentally friendly and more responsible? If not, do you think that that's because it's impossible because the industry is not ready yet? So I think there are signs that at least there's pressure on companies to be more responsible. So, but of course, some of it is, you know, is sort of window dressing and we have to be careful. So I don't, I think the consensus would be. that there's been at least some movement in a good direction. But I think the question is, is it going to continue? I have a, I mean, I think there's, they're reasons to think it will because I think that first people are more, you know, are more aware of climate change and the dangers, and so they're getting worried about it. They're seeing that governments aren't doing what they should. By the way, I mean, let me make it clear. government role, the role of governments of this is very important. But I'm talking about, you know, given that they're not doing a perfect job, we have to do things as well. And that involves putting pressure on companies. And I think people are waking up to this. And so there's going to be more pressure. And then there's also people we say, oh, young people, people like you, are more socially responsible than older people. And so the, you know, the, the millennials, and younger are going to be, they're going to create a different culture and they are going to want companies to, even the ones they own when they eventually own them, to behave better. So given that I think the pressure is going to continue, I'm fairly optimistic. The thing I'm most concerned about is this win-win thing. So a lot of business people are saying, yes, yes, we're all in favor of ESG. because it's good for the bottom line. But once it becomes apparent that that is not always the case and sometimes it's bad for the bottom line, are they going to now then sort of find some reason to turn against it and somehow win the day? And the status quo will be preserved. I hope not, but that is a little, you know, something I worry about a bit. And Rachel asks, one of the things you're best known for is developing theories on incomplete contracts. What impact do you think these theories have on our institutions and how they should be governed? A wonderful question. If only I wish I had some great answers about, oh, you know, we've completely changed this and this works so much better now because of my work. I fear it's not, I don't have those success stories. I think the work that I have done and others have done in this area on incomplete contracts is helpful mainly as a kind of way of thinking about things. So when it comes to public versus private ownership of prisons, say, a lot of people would instinctively think this is some sort of moral question or, you know, private is terrible in the case of prisons. How could you possibly think about that? As opposed to thinking of it as an economic question, how to get the best outcome. And, you know, the private sector is capable of doing many good things. We see it all the time. So I think, but my work in this area doesn't, tell you it should always be private or always public. It tells you it depends on the circumstances. And in the paper, my co-authors and I talk about different types of services. So, you know, you've got prisons. What about hospitals? What about schools? What about the army? You know, what should be private? What should be public? And we apply our theory. But it's more art than science. And in the case of prisons, we argue that the highest security one should be public, but some of the other ones could be private. But I think if you were considering a particular situation, there would be no formula to tell you. But I think the framework would be useful, the kinds of things to be thinking about, whether the quality issues are particularly important in this context. Maybe yes, maybe in that context, no. So it's all qualitative. I'm not sure that was quite an answer to the question. It's an answer to some question. And Beatrice asked, do you think that companies caring about their impact is just a trend that makes them look good? Or do new departments focused on sustainability actually have an impact? Well, yes, we sort of covered some of that. I think that for it to work, the pressure has to continue from shareholders and others. In other words, I think if you just left it to CEOs, they might well abandon it as soon as it was a question of reducing profit, of incurring extra costs. Because the more money they have coming out of the company, the more they get. I think people like to have more resources rather than, less. And so I think the pressure has got to come up from outside. But I think, so that's up to us, shareholders of whom you are either already or you will be soon. And Chloe asks, smart contracts have evolved and become more used in the last few years. What are your views on them and how do you think they can ever work in the long term? Good question. So I have a bit of problem, a problem with smart, contracts because they're based, as I understand it, on, I mean, it's blockchain and Bitcoin and there's Bitcoin at the bottom of it all. And like many economists, I'm a big skeptic on Bitcoin because it seems to me it's a bubble and it should burst. Now, it's taking quite a long time to do so and maybe we'll all be proved wrong. But I don't really like a system that is based on something as flimsy as that. However, there are elements of blockchain and smart contracts which are appealing because certain things can be automated. And so that, I mean, an example that I think is realistic would be, you know, if you want to get insurance against your flight being delayed. And so, you know, in the old days, you would have to, let's suppose your flight was delayed, you'd have to document that and, you know, prove to the insurance company that it really was delayed. And it would all be quite, you know, take a long time. And with blockchain, the thing can be automated so that, you know, the flight time is automatically relayed to the insurance company or whoever. And then Bitcoin is, unfortunately, is automatically transferred from the insurance company to you. And all the paperwork is avoided and delays. So, you know, that's good. I can see the benefits of that. is that an answer? Let me just say, though, one thing. I don't think of smart contracts as being a solution to that many problems, but in particular, the kind of things I'm particularly interested in my work, particularly in my recent work, is long-term contractual relationships, which are relationships where we work together over many years, and the question is, can we develop a good relationship or not? I don't think smart contracts are going to help that situation at all. That's a good answer, in my opinion, and it's a good place to leave our questions. I'd like to finish with one question that we've asked every speaker this term. If you could give our audience one thought to take away with them this week, what would that be? There's a thought to take away with them. Just something to leave them with, I suppose. But not about the talk per se. Up to you. How many minutes do I have? Well, you're not. Democratic institutions are very important. I think I'm waiting to see whether the American democratic system will continue to work. you're not in America, but I hope as young people you will push to make sure that democratic institutions stay strong. Well, thank you. Serious thought, I'm afraid. It's been an honour to have you this evening, and thank you very much to all of our audience members for joining us. I hope you have a lovely evening. Thank you. Thank you, Molly. It's been a pleasure. Thank you. Bye, everybody. I'm
