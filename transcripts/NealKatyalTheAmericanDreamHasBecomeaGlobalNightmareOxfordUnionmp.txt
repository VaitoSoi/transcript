 So look, I recognize I have the hardest job of the night of all eight speakers. I stand between you and the booze at the bar. Our case is very simple. Our friends didn't meet their threshold. They have to show the American dream has become a nightmare, a nightmare. And sure, they say that they say, beautiful songs. They had a list of grievances that goes back to 1945, but did they really convince you, did they prove the case that the American dream is now a nightmare? Ladies and gentlemen, the American dream is not a nightmare. The nightmare comes from those people who would give up on it. Donald Trump, Donald Trump lost. Your nightmare? is that he might win again? He's going to jail, baby. We have a clear point. It's the Biden point. It's the Senator Brown point. A nightmare compared to what? What's the alternative to the United States? If you think the American dream has become a nightmare, you certainly haven't spoken to anyone who has waited and waited for an H-1 visa. My friend, Professor Kennedy, says, the world is suffused with ignorance and bigotry, and the United States is guilty of contributing to it. That a nightmare does not make. That's not a nightmare. That's a problem. We're not defending that the United States is perfect. All we have to do is convince you it's not a nightmare, and it's not. It's not Ms. Day, the number of startups. It's the fact that America is a startup. That's how we're built. America's always been that way, borrowing from the best of the world, taking the best, adapting them, giving freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, all of this, so that we can have debates very much like this. And the Constitution itself recognized, my friend referred to Federalist 51, they recognized that men aren't angels, and they've had an Article 5 in amendment process to change it so the painful exclusions of women from the right to vote and African Americans from being fully human. All of that changed. Our founders put that, they laced that into the Constitution. A nightmare? Look at our team. Look at who's on our side. Colonel Vindman's parents came from Ukraine in 1979. My parents came to America from India in 1968. They came for one reason. just because they knew they could land on its shores and be treated fairly. Senator Brown's here. His parents go back, his family goes back to 1620. Ninth generation, New Hampshire resident. We're here together defending this because that's what America is. The national motto, E. Pluribus Unum, out of many come one. We've always been young, scrappy, and hungry. That's what America is. Now, I mentioned my parents. We can do it on Twitter. I mentioned my parents, and that reminds me of my very first Supreme Court case. I was representing Bin Laden's driver in challenging Guantanamo, which is something that my friend Israel mentioned earlier, and I was challenging it as a legal black hole. And the Pentagon wouldn't let me go and meet my client for a long time, the driver for bin Laden, but I ultimately got down there. and he said to me, he kicked everyone out of the room. He had been in solitary confinement for 10 months. He hadn't seen another human soul. And he kicked everyone out of the room, and I think he's going to yell at me. And he looks at me, and he smiles and says, I just have one question for you. Why are you doing this? Your last client was Al Gore. And I remember thinking, I paused, and I thought to myself, God, you know, what is the answer to that? and ultimately about a minute into it, I gave him this answer. I said, look, my parents came here from India. They didn't come here because of the quality of the sports teams or its soil. They came here for one simple reason. They could land on its shores and be treated fairly, not perfectly but fairly, and better than any other country on earth. And that had always been my experience. And the founders of our 14th Amendment, Representative Bingham, wrote the Equal Protection Clause, And the Equal Protection Clause doesn't just guarantee equal protection to citizens. It guarantees it to persons. Why? Because Bingham said we have to overrule the worst line and the worst Supreme Court case in American history, the line in Dred Scott v. Stanford, which says only citizens have constitutional rights. Fourteenth Amendment says, nah-uh, everyone in America has constitutional rights. And so I argued that case. My first case in the Supreme Court, and I won it, even with the very conservative Supreme Court. Guantanamo was declared illegal in a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and the Constitution and rights would now apply at Guantanamo. And I remember I went out after hearing the decision to the press cameras, and at 500 of them on the Supreme Court Plaza, and they're all asking, what does the decision say? What does it say? What does it mean? It's 184 pages. I haven't read it yet. But I will tell you verbatim what I said to the press. I said, here's what happened on this day. You had the lowest of the low, this driver to bin Laden, and a third grade educated you many, and he brings a lawsuit, not just against anyone, but the nation's most powerful man, the world's most powerful man, the president of the United States, and he doesn't bring it in a rinky-dink traffic court, he brings it in the highest court of the land, the Supreme Court of the United States, and he wins. That's something remarkable about America. In many other countries, this driver would have been shot for bringing his case. More than the point for me, his lawyer would have been shot. But that's what makes America special. That's why America is truly an exceptional country. And there are great moments I've seen. I was privileged to be part of the marriage equality team at the United States Supreme Court. And we walked in that day. We didn't know if the decision was come down. A hundred people saying protesting marriage equality, 100 people saying marriage equality is right on the courthouse steps. And then the decision came down, and we realized marriage equality was now the law of the land. in all 50 states. And I walked out to that Supreme Court Plaza, 8,000 people on that plaza singing America the beautiful, America Tiss of D, and linking hands and understanding. That's the promise of America that's best. Do we have our problems? Of course. My friends mentioned George Floyd. I was a prosecutor in George Floyd. We sent that Derek Chauvin to jail for 22 and a half years where he is now. That's the system working. Does it always work? No. I was privileged to attack the Muslim ban and argue that case in the Supreme Court. And trust me, Professor Kennedy, I'll never defend Donald Trump. And argue that case, and we lost it in the Supreme Court five to four. And I was devastated when we lost. I didn't think America had become a nightmare, but it got a little worse on that day. We're a lot worse. But in the seeds of defeat, come things, lessons. That's our founding lesson. The one that came to me was because I saw a column by Anne Coulter, a journalist in America, and she characterized the oral argument in the Supreme Court this way. Quote, arguing against Donald Trump was first-generation American Neil Cotill. There are plenty of 10th-generation America haters. You couldn't get one of them to argue that we should end our country through mass immigration. End our country through mass immigration. I rebel against the idea that mass immigration would end our country. Instead, I recognize that's the rock on which our country was built. Anne Coulter thought that being the child of immigrants was my weakness, but she was wrong. It's my strength because I know what the American dream is. My parents left for it, as did Colonel Vindemans, as did so many. My parents came for e pluribus unum. they came for a dream and even if you think they didn't get that dream in full they certainly didn't get a nightmare my friends certainly didn't meet what they told you they promised you the first speech first speech said quote the American dream is nothing but nightmares nothing but nightmares not even close look dreaming always runs the risk of a nightmare But if we give up on our dreams, if we give up on our dreams, we have to settle for the world as it is when we wake up. So we ask you to go through that door, move left, they didn't meet their threshold. Thank you.
