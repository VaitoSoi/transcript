 It's now time to begin the debate. This House would move beyond organised religion. And with that, I look to Lucas Hooper, guest liaison officer, to open the case for the proposition. There are things about organised religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in his name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion, and I'll show you 100 retrogressions. Honourable Embers, these are not the words of any well-known philosopher, nor any well-known theologian, nor any recognised big thinker. They are in fact the words of the Mr. Francis Albert Sinatra. I know it's a bit different to the whole flimmy to the moon thing. As a man whose mother was a midwife who ran an illegal abortion clinic catered to Catholic schoolgirls who had nowhere else to turn due to their religion, it is not surprising that Sinatra had a bleak view of organised religion and would clearly support the proposition motion that this house would move beyond it. it. Coincidentally, Frank Sinatra is also one of my mother's favourite singers, and she was overjoyed when I told her that both she and him would be getting a mention in my first ever union speech, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you, Madam President, for the opportunity to speak here tonight. Indeed, I feel that I'm fairly well-placed to discuss the topic of organised religion due to my family background. My father is a Christian who doesn't go to church, although he almost always always promises to. My mother is sort of a Christian, but one who likes to hedge her bets and pray to God and the universe, whatever that is, and my brother, in what can only be described as a new chapter in a series of worrying identity crises, as decided he's a Catholic. To be honest, I think he just likes the idea of being able to chat up South American girls more effectively. He's going to hate me for that. I myself, and I'm an atheist, I have been for some time, but I don't want you to think that I'm just going to sit here and bash religion itself. I'm just going to bash the horrible things that it causes. So, Honourable Members, my case for tonight will rest on three main points. Firstly, organised religion has caused more harm than good, especially when you compare it to personal spirituality. Secondly, the personal spirituality could accomplish the goals of religion and can do so more excessively. Thirdly and finally, organised religion is a tool of the elite ruling class, and as a relic of an inequitable society, we must move past it. I apologise if my tone has been slightly irreverence so far, considering the topic at hand. I can, however, assure you that the opposition speakers tonight will probably be more respectful, and it falls on me to introduce them. We firstly have Jenny Gray and Bradley, she's a first year starting history at Hertford, and as a committee member well known for taking debate speakers clubbing, I hate to tell her it's more likely to be bread and wine than plushiega bombs with this lot. Professor Sondra Hausner is Oxford's very own professor in anthropology of religion. As someone who focuses on Himalayan monks, one of the only peaceful religious groups out there, I think it's time someone told her what the Catholics have been up to. Dr. Rabbi, Dr. Jonathan Romaine, MBE, is a rabbi, writer and broadcaster, as well as a minister of the maiden head synagogue. He has written on how to marry someone from a different religion. Given that he's acknowledged that marriage seems hard enough without your ancestors wanting to kill you, other, I'm surprised to see him on the opposite bench tonight. The most Reverend Dr. Eamon Martin is the most senior Catholic priest in Ireland. As he's from an organisation that's the good guys in horror movies and the bad guys in real life, I'm excited to see how he's going to defend organised religion. Madam President, these are your speakers in opposition and they are most welcome. Encyclopedia of wars, out of all 1,763 known historical conflicts, 7% were caused by religion. Furthermore, Matthew White's The Great Big Book of Horrible Things, which ranks the 100 worst atrocities by death toll, gives religion as the primary cause of 11 of the most unspeakable events in human history. When compared to personal spirituality, organized religion is deadly. I can think a few lone actors who, in practicing their personal spirituality, have committed atrocities. I mean, you have the sort of Ted Kaczynski's of the world, you have school shooters, but I think we can all agree that the death tolls that they have created are far less than something like the Crusades. In fact, one only needs to look to the Crusades and jihad and the terror that it has caused to see the organisation within religion has caused significant harm. The troubles on the island of Ireland were multifaceted. And I'm not going to sit here and discuss that in too much detail. I'm not going to purport to be any sort of historian on the matter. But I think it would be naive to say that religion was not a major factor. Indeed, the conflict between Sunni and Shia Muslims in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, where again, factionalism and organisation within religion has caused death and destruction, both show that organised religion has caused significant harm. frankly, the idea that whether you believe that whineer bread actually becomes Christ's body or not, or whether this rightful successor to the Prophet Muhammad was Abu Bakur or Ali, I apologise for my pronunciation was terrible there, dictates your allegiance to factions in an armed conflict is surely a damning indictment of how organisation and factionalism within religion brings more harm than good. To be fair, I think it isn't surprising that religion is capable of influencing people to do terrible things. The word cult is often applied to more niche groups, those with more radical views, with the worst that use violence being labelled terrorists. Take the Taliban or the KKK, religious extremists who believe themselves be scholars. Indeed, the Afghan population is currently suffering after President Joe Biden's plan to make Afghanistan Taliban again went a bit too far. The capture of cities and the infliction of terror on this scale requires organisation. loan actors can do bad things. I don't dispute this, but the worst atrocities in human history are committed by organised groups. It would be foolish, of course, to say that organised religion has no benefits, and I'm not going to say that tonight. Those on the opposition bench will likely discuss lovely ideas, such as community and accessibility, Kumbaya, etc. It may seem that these are two things that personal spirituality just can't offer. but this isn't the case. Community is something we all long for as humans. You know, we're pack animals. We want to belong. Organised religion, therefore, it seems a great way in which to connect to the local community and it can bring joy to many people's lives. That is, as long as you can form. Religion really is a primarily instructive exercise. It tells you what to do, what not to do, what to think, what not to think. It can lead to good advice, love thy neighbour, etc. It can also lead to some of the most disgusting persecution that humanity has ever seen. To be honest, I'd be quite happy to forego some good advice in order to avoid the latter. Accessibility within religion has improved in very recent years. There are LGBT-friendly congregations who are pioneering the way forward towards inclusive religion. However, homophobia and transphobia are still common. within religious communities. When you think of those who oppose gay marriage, who oppose abortion, who oppose trans rights, are they secular people, whose wishes are solely political? I doubt it. Smart money says no. Are there individually spiritualistic people who are bigots? Of course. There are many irreligious people who are bigots. There are many bigots out there, unfortunately. However, the enforcement of hateful beliefs requires organisation within a community, an organised religion has been a significant vehicle for the promulgation of hate. Turning back to this question of community, it can clearly go too far. Mormons are well known for their cultish behaviour, as well as prolonged accusations of sexual misconduct and paedophilia. And it's not just them. Priests from many denominations, sorry, have been accused and convicted of the same disgusting. crimes. It is clear that community can quickly become cult when religion is too organised. The elite has long used religion as a way of controlling the population. As Seneca argued, religion is useful to the ruling class. In Fugel Britain, the church was hugely powerful. Religious figures were some of the most important in society. The church operated in obscure ways and the Bible solely in Latin until 1522. it was in this way that the church kept their stranglehold on the people. People were essentially told that there is an all-powerful being that you must obey, and terrible, terrible things will happen to you if you don't. And their word is in this book that only I can read. Sounds like a bitterer red flag to me. Religion has been used to make the little people in society serve the big people's interests for time and memorial. German Vermont. Not right now, sorry. German-Vermarked buckles, belt buckles in World War II were inscribed with the phrase, Gott mint-uns. I'm sorry again, my pronunciations off there. It means God is with us. And militaries around the world today have an infatuation with religion. The slavery of Africans was justified on religious grounds, as is the treatment of women, LGBT people and minorities under Sharia law. Organised religion has proven itself time and time again to be useful for the ruling elite as a tool to justice. by atrocities. Religious taxes have existed for over a thousand years, and the church is still one of the richest organisations in the world. Recently, mega-churches in America, which are known for being, again, a bit culty, and for confusing their love of prophets, for a love of prophets, have been taking money from their members for years. There are even personalities who have built fortunes off of religion. Scientology has even convinced Tom Cruise to show out so that he can fight Martians, or something like that. organized religion can easily turn into a profiteering exercise. I realise that I'm probably laboring the point a bit at this point that I don't like organised religion, but to be fair it is my job for tonight. I'll conclude by tying together, I hope, everything that I've said. Religion, and I want to stress this, is in no way bad itself. And just because I'm irreligious myself doesn't mean that you shouldn't be at all. It's not inherently bad. However, it does go to the core of our being. It is incredibly powerful. It tells us that if we don't do what it says, terrible things will happen to you, and you can't control that. Lone people can do bad things. We all know that. Murderers are still bad. However, the worst things that are done in society are done by organized groups of people. When you combine that core central part of our being being with organization, it can be incredibly dangerous. And organized religion has shown itself to cause more harm than good over time. And so to round this all off, I'll say that if you think that a nice hymn service or a nice service in a temple or from whatever faith you believe isn't worth tolerating colonialism, Scientologists and Mormons, to name a few, I urge you to vote in favor of the motion tonight. Thank you. Thank you.
