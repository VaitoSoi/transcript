 Thank you, Mr. President. I have to say I'm the assistant editor, not the deputy editor, but thank you for promoting me. I will be letting Fraser Nelson know that tomorrow morning. I'd like to first start by recognizing the achievements of my honourable friend on the proposition bench, Guo Kai Su. As one of the students leading the 1989 Tianmen Square protests, he dared to imagine a China that was different to the one that he lived in, a China that was more liberal, more open, democratic. For that, he and his peers have sacrificed so much. Some of them killed that night, and some exiled from China for the remainder of their lives. So thank you. Now, the students that year were following in the footsteps of those who'd come before. Generations of Chinese reformers and students who have dreamed of a better China. The first student protests in Tianan Square were not actually in 1989, including 1919. What unites these dreamers of a different era is the knowledge that China is not the same as its government of the day, that our country can be better. So the first point I'd like to make is that, and one that surely my honorable friend agrees with me on, is that China is not the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese people are not the same as the Chinese Communist Party. When we make statements like the ones in today's motion, we have to be careful with our language here. do not write off an entire nation and its people because of their government of the day. I do not believe that China as a nation poses an existential threat to our way of life. Having said that, and I do appreciate that the best motions are written to be provocative, so let's tackle what I think the debate is really about and what the debate has been so far been about, which is that the People's Republic of China, in other words, the one founded by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, is that an existential threat to our way of life? We've already heard from the proposition side how there is no dialogue in China, that the very authoritarian structures of the Chinese state, as it currently is, allow something like COVID to get out to the rest of the world without proper scrutiny. Well, I agree with all of that. But that's not what this motion is about. And before I get into it, I want to first define my term similarly. So we've heard that our way of life is a political way of life, and I agree with that. It's not about tea or anything else. in the UK and liberal democracies at large we have freedom of speech, political participation, accountability for those in authority, even if that's occasionally through leaked WhatsApp messages. So that's what I will define as our way of life, the political rights and freedoms that liberal democratic structure give us. But even so, even though our definitions are the same, I still do not believe that the CCP and the PRC is an existential threat to our way of life practicing these values here at home. I mean, it's clear that the CCP does not believe in these values, but that's not what the motion is about tonight. Are they threatening our practice of these values at home? My answer to that is no. And today I'm going to focus mainly on the fact that it couldn't possibly be an existential threat to us, even if it wanted to be. Let's consider what the threats could look like. First and most immediately, it could erode democratic values beyond its borders. We've heard about exporting authoritarianism. In the West, you know, we are not invulnerable, to interference and infiltration. I'm talking about paying off politicians, manipulating university curriculums, shutting down campus debate. These would all be unacceptable in our democracy. But let's not exaggerate the danger. I mean, come on, the CCP seems to have thought that Barry Gardner was a worthwhile asset to develop. I'm not sure they've got this covert op stuff quite down yet. But more seriously, I mean, not all examples of influence from the People's Republic of China are threats to our way of life. are we really saying that the presence of Confucius institutes on campus, for example, if all they do is present a CCP version of history, will threaten how free our campuses are. Are we so insecure in the strength of democratic values and the power of our critical faculties that we think any student who picks up a people's daily will be immediately brainwashed? Of course we must make sure that these are not fronts for espionage that critics of the CCP feel safe to speak out, as Spencer has mentioned about Drew Pavlou. But And we also must insist on transparent funding for politicians and academic organizations to ensure that the scope of their work is not dictated by some shadowy donor. This is part and part of defending our democracy. This is part and part of having accountability in a healthy democracy and what we should be doing against all authoritarian regimes, not just China. And I think, for the large part, we're doing quite well. It is totally possible to contain this threat. And I think Western countries are alive to this threat. and that's why we hear so much about Chinese influence. There is a challenge here, to be sure, but it's not an existential threat. Now, how else could the PRC destroy our way of life? It could choke supply chains. We've seen this in numerous countries that have political spats with Beijing, where trade is used as political leverage. In order for this to be an existential threat, we'd be looking at some kind of war scenario. Let's say China invades Taiwan. Some kind of global sanctions regime is levied against China in the same way it has been against Russia, and China tries to retaliate. A lot of ifs here, but it's a possible future. So let's make sure that on the stuff that really matters, the West seals up its vulnerabilities when it comes and reduces dependence on China. I'm talking about things like semiconductors and important pharmaceuticals. We would also want to bear in mind the electronic devices that we use, that they aren't somehow linked to Chinese manufacturers in real time. But let's be clear, in this scenario, China will be hurting itself as much as it is hurting the West, perhaps more so. After all, trade is a two-way street, and when it comes to hard economic power, China may be the second largest economy in the world, but a united West is many times wealthier and more technologically advanced than China and its few allies. There's also a question of whether the CCP can even survive such a delineation in globalization. To speak of existential threat here to the West is to be defeatist. And what about a real war scenario? You might be thinking of the Soviet Union, the last great communist power, and the world falling like dominoes behind the iron curtain. With the invasion of Ukraine, this possibility will seem particularly vivid today, especially if any of you have roots in Eastern Europe. But the PRC is not the USSR. Its ideology to the so-called socialism with Chinese characteristics is not universally applicable in the same way that communism was under the Soviet leadership, not least because, as the Royal Kaisi says, is not an ism at all. Take a cold, close look at the PRC's influence campaign across the world. say the Belt and Road Initiative. You'll find here that actually Beijing has lost out. In recent years, Chinese creditors have had to delay debt repayments for dozens of countries, not even sure if they'll ever get this money back. And if debt diplomacy is a feature, not a bug of the Belt and Road Initiative, then why is the best loot that Beijing has to show for it, a financially struggling port in Sri Lanka? Shouldn't it have got more in this decade of Belt and Road Initiative? It's far from the world domination scheme that the West feared, and, to be fair, that Beijing tried to bill at us. In fact, there's evidence that on the ground the initiative has turned public opinion and politicians against China, with the PRC loosing rather than gaining its soft power in recipient countries. And I've barely even touched on the instabilities that affect China at home, the aging population, the unsustainable housing market, the return of Chinese politics to a one-man show, and the instability inherent in that. 20 years ago, this was billed as China's century. Now I'm not even sure that China will ever overtake the US as the world's largest economy. So to conclude, we should be clear-eyed about the People's Republic of China, but let's see the country for what it is and identify the real threats while tuning out some of the rhetoric, which is just noise. The PRC is not an existential threat to our way of life. For one, it's not strong enough to be. But before I finish, I want to leave you with a final thought. in this panic state, could the West's response to China actually be the greatest existential threat to our way of life? Back in the 50s, the philosopher Hannah Arendt was among those who pointed out how McCarthyism actually ushered in more authoritarianism in America than it tried to defeat. Today, there are echoes of McCarthyism in our reaction to China, and in particular, it concerns me that fears about Chinese influence seem too often to be accused those who are members of the Chinese diaspora. I suspect that some of you here may have experienced that yourself. Spencer mentioned the China initiative by the State Department in the US. What he didn't mention was that the Chinese initiative has actually been shut down now for its ineffectiveness and because it was so wrongly accused so many people, often of Chinese heritage. So as the West responds to the rise of China, let's not shoot ourselves in the foot and lose our liberal values whilst we're trying to defend ourselves against this hyped-up enemy. The People's Republic of China may not be an existential threat to our way, of life, but never underestimate the ability of democracies to lose their own footing in a moment of fear. Now, when you vote tonight, when you go through those doors, I hope you vote nay, not because you agree with the Chinese Communist Party or you don't think that its human rights abuses are despicable, but because we believe that the West and our democratic values, our way of life, it's much stronger than what it can be, than the PRC can threaten it. And I hope that one day we can see a China much more in our way of life too. Thank you.
