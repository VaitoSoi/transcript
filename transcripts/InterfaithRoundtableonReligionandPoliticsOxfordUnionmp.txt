 Thank you very much, all for joining us. How this is going to work is each of our speakers are going to give about three to six minutes of brief introductory remarks. I will then ask them a few questions. They will discuss amongst themselves. And as the event goes on, I'll open up to questions from the audience. the audience. So for our first introduction remarks, Professor Silverman, please could you share your thoughts with us. Okay, thank you. Thank you for inviting me here. It's a pleasure to be at the Oxford Union, especially with such other distinguished people. Mixing politics with religion is fraught with danger. We all know theocracies where leaders governed by the will of an infallible God, openly defined, defying the correct faith is called blasphemy and leads to harsh punishments, even death. I think everyone should have the right to practice any religion or none, as long as they don't force their beliefs on others. I appreciate people whose religion inspires them to work on important social justice issues. In countries that are not theocratic, politics, might still be infused with religion. My country, the United States, has a secondary government with a problem of religion immersed in politics. I hold in my hand a godless document. It's the United States Constitution. Our framers established a first nation in history meant to separate religion and government. Authority rests with we the people, the first three words of the Constitution, not without the deity. The only mentions of religion in the Constitution are exclusionary. The First Amendment prohibits the U.S. Congress from making laws respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Article 6 prohibits religious text. for public office. That didn't stop some states from putting religious requirements in their state constitutions, including my state. I was a candidate for governor of South Carolina in 1990 to challenge the provision of my state constitution that bars atheists from holding public office. After an eight-year legal battle, I won a unanimous decision in the South Carolina Supreme Court striking down this unconstitutional religious test requirement. The U.S. Declaration of Independence, which is not a governing document, does refer to a creator endowing people with unalienable rights. The Declaration was a call for rebellion against the British Crown to distinguish us from an empire that asserted the divine right of kings. Our founders were products of the Enlightenment, looking toward reason and evidence from the natural world. Many were deists, referring to nature's God, who set the laws of nature in motion, and then retired as deity emeritus. Had they known about evolution and modern, science, many would likely have been atheists. In 1954, American President Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the addition of the words under God to our Pledge of Allegiance, to distinguish us from godless communists. This turned our secular pledge, recited daily by students, into a religious pledge. America is one nation under the Constitution, or maybe under Canada, but we're not one nation under God. Similarly, in God we trust became our controversial national motto in 1956, at the height of the Cold War with the Soviet Union, replacing the more inclusive motto, Latin for out of many one. The Ten Commandments are another divisive issue. Many Americans who want them displayed in schools and courts either don't realize or don't care that the First Commandment, Thou shalt have no other gods, conflicts with the First Amendment, which guarantees the freedom to worship one, many, or no gods. churches and individuals are certainly free to pose to ten commandments openly, just not on government buildings. In 2016, Donald Trump became president in large part because of overwhelming support of white Christian evangelicals. Many are also white Christian nationalists who long for the olden days that, when their white privilege enabled them more easily to discriminate against those of a different race and those with non-Christian or no religious beliefs. These white Christian nationalists are trying to rewrite American history, claiming that the U.S. was formed as a Christian nation. On January 6th, 2021, we learned just how fragile my country's democracy could be, as Donald Trump incited a mob of terrorists to storm our nation's capital in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Many were inspired by their white Christian nationalism. Lots of Christians in America feel Christianity is under attack, and the Christians deserve special rights, including tax dollars to support, private Christian schools. They want to require prayer in schools and sex education classes to teach abstinence only. Some have convinced states to pass anti-gay, anti-transgender, and anti-abortion bills. Some also promote unscientific religious teachings like creationism in secular schools. Christians have a lot of influence over the U.S. government. The Republican Party succeeded in packing our Supreme Court with conservative Christian justices, who in June will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, a 1973 decision that legalized abortion everywhere in the U.S. Looking at countries around the world shows that religion and politics can make a terrible, partnership and when mixing the two we often get the worst of both thank you thank you very much professor professor cool thank you I think I'd like to take a slightly different approach in the topic of religion and politics so I'm speaking from the Sikh perspective both in my academic capacity but also from personal experience and I think when considering this topic it's important to take into consideration experience so I'm an anthropologist by background and what I'd really like to do is to focus on actually the understanding of what we mean when we say religion what we mean when we say politics sorry and what we say in the Sikh faith is that there is not a separation of these two domains it comes down to a fundamental understanding of what we define religion as what we define politics as and we don't see these as kind of conflicting domains in the Sikh faith itself so I really want to draw attention to the way that we understand these concepts. So for example, in the Sikh faith there is no term specifically for secular. So in the spoken language, there is no term for secular. There is no term for religion. We talk about Thuram, which is this all-encompassing world view. And so within that, all of these thoughts, mindsets and beliefs are part of that. And when we talk about a divine or a god, we don't mean this very kind of Abrahamic definition of a god. And so this does not not permeate the way that Sikhs practice and believe their faith. So I don't see this as being a fundamental issue for Sikhs in the way that they practice. Having said that, religion and politics have taken a more academic approach in general discourse. And what that means to say is that then they are set up as these two dichotomous realms. But what I want to go back to is where I started, this lived experience. How does that work for people in practice? How does that work for politicians? How does that work for religious scholars. When we talk about politics, are we talking about politics with a small P or a capital P? How are we defining these terms? How are we actually implementing these terms? And I think I'm going to leave my reflection quite short because I'd actually, I think it's more interesting if we engage in a bit of conversation. Thank you very much. Professor Gordon. Thank you very much. It's a great pleasure to be here. I am by training a historian of the early modern period with a particular interest in the Reformation and just to pick up on some of the comments already it likewise is a world in which politics and religion cannot be separated and certainly wasn't in in their mind and one of the things that I think is significant about the reformation was that it brought a new way of thinking about the relationship between the temporal powers spiritual powers and the way in which the Reformation was in itself inherently not only political in the sense that the reformers decided very early on that what had to happen was that if there was to be any chance of success, the reform of Christianity had to be tied to political authority. So right from its inception, the Protestant Reformation was inherently political. But what they understood by this political was the kind of the coterminous that the body of the faithful of the church was that of the state. But very quickly, and I'll just make a broad story very short, it became a movement that in many ways ate its own principles that the Protestant churches having emerged as a movement of rebellion, as resistance against medieval Catholicism, very quickly instituted itself and began to practice very much many of the things in which it had reacted. violence, it was putting persecution, it was putting dissenters to death very quickly after the implementation of the Reformation. So this is a subject that interests me very much as a historian of the pre-modern world is the very sort of fluid relationship between religion and politics and what have been some of the consequences of that, particularly through the Reformation, the growth of religious diversity, the fragmentation of the Reformation of the Reformation into many different religious movements, which created questions of coexistence. How do you deal with difference in terms of religion within political bodies? This is by the 17th century, is a central question, starts to raise issues of toleration. John Locke and some of the early thinkers about this. I'm not saying there's a linear development, but these are the questions of religion and pluralism are very important. And I think that's actually a helpful thing for us to, reflect on in our contemporary discussions. I am a practicing Christian of the reform tradition, a kind of progressive perspective that sees very much engagement in the world in terms of, and some of things that have already been mentioned, social reforms, social justice, questions that are very important to us. I take the view that religious communities make a very significant contribution to our society. Not, and I would say we know we longer, despite Trappings live in Christian societies in the West. Christianity in many ways has been dissentered, which I would say is a good thing. But it has to move itself away from a position of privilege at the head of the table to take its place in a broader community of religious communities and non-religious communities in offering something which I think can make a significant contribution to our society, not from as they say, a place of domination. of privilege or power, but as communities who are actively engaged in a whole range of activities that are of enormous social benefit. So I'm very keen to engage in this conversation in ways in which I think religious communities make a significant contribution to society. Thank you very much Professor Gordon. Last but not least, Dr. Freud-Candall. Thank you. It's lovely to have lock and tolerance reference reference. because my interest in this topic is primarily in terms of my background as in theology and the study in particular of the Jewish community in Britain and the pathways of resettlement that the Jewish community has navigated in which undoubtedly the role of tolerance as a central defining principle in British in the British political system played an incredibly important role in the the different ways the different pathways in which Jews found a place within within British society Having said that, my particular interest in examining that journey of the Jewish community in Britain entails understanding and examining the influence that an established church has precisely had on the opportunities that minority religious groups were able to enjoy in a British context. And there, as I say, the influence of Lockean toleration in combination with the role of an established church in the way in which it played out in an English context, was incredibly important, on the one hand, in a very positive way, in enabling Jews in Britain in a very notable contrast to the experiences of Jews, for example, in continental Europe, from having to undergo a process of having to explain a way and their role, their acceptability within British society. The notion of tolerance in an established society in Britain meant that Jews in a British context were described discriminated against in terms of being non- Anglican, but they were not discriminated against as Jews per se, and that significantly altered their experience. But having said that this was a positive on some level, there is a flip side to that. And Bill Williams is a social historian who coined the term the anti-Semitism of tolerance to characterize the Jewish experience in Britain. What does that mean? It means that the whole premise of tolerance is that there is one correct view, and that is Anglicanism in an English context. But within the parameters of that notion of tolerance, there is an acceptance of alternative views, albeit while not accepting them as fully ideal. So this anti-Semitism of tolerance impacts on the way in which the Jewish experience developed, leading the Jewish community in Britain precisely to construct institutions, which in many ways can be seen to see, to offer parallels to the Church of England because that was the way in which Jews in Britain felt that they had to seek to find a pathway to being fully accepted. And so that's why we see the emergence of centralized institutions as critical to the formation of the Jewish community in Britain, often at the expense of creativity within the community, because the emphasis is on creating umbrella bodies that can provide parallels to Anglican structures, But by creating these umbrella bodies, you focus on that which everyone shares rather than creating a space in which to articulate alternative voices. And so those are my sort of primary interests in terms of the interrelationships between church and state, religion and politics, the way in which on the one hand it can be incredibly beneficial. But on the other hand, in terms of the very severe challenges it poses. But I'm looking forward to the discussion. Thank you very much to all our speakers for those introductory remarks. I think from my perspective I want to sort of go down two different avenues of approach with the issues that I've seen raised there. One about the role of religion within politics and the other about the role of religious beliefs within politics. I think that Professor Silverman highlighted how the two can be quite, and the comparison between the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom, offers an interesting way of exploring the difference between the two. So we'll start first with religion in politics. The United Kingdom or England more specifically, as Dr. Freud-Candell pointed out, has an established church and has done for nearly 500 years. Do you think that the existence of an established church in the United Kingdom is a results in an undue influence of religion within politics or do you think that it promotes a tolerant space for other faiths? I think we'll start with Dr. Freud, Kendall. Both and is I think the kind of response. Again, it comes back to the notion of tolerance. I think the whole point is that on the one hand, we can, when we look at the British model, we see that it, again, as I said, precisely creates the space for alternative views by understanding the limitations that an established church imposes on the creation of a civil society, the requirement that that entails to facilitate tolerance of alternative views. On the other hand, I mean we can think just if we take the most recent example in a British context. I mean, there's certainly an obvious recent example in an American context for us to think about as well in terms of the interruption of religion into political discourse. But in the British context, it's the Archbishop of Canterbury's recent comments with regard to the current government's Rwanda refugee policy. And what's interesting is the way in which there has been a notable backlash against the church interfering in politics. But at the same time, let's look at the structure of our political system where the House of Lords is required to have the bishops of the Anglican Church. So that enforces a requirement of some sort of negotiation. And I think what's really interesting to examine is the journey that British society has undertaken really in only the last 30 or so years, where the scope for a greater multiculturalism has been carved out, which obviously itself creates its own challenges in terms of the definitions of that multiculturalism. But at the same time, it does indicate a... a shift that has occurred away from the rather monoculturalist approach that has tended to dominate previously. Professor Silverman, to compare the United States and United Kingdom, in the United States you have a sort of a culture where religious rhetoric is frequently used in elections, where Christians especially or individuals are prone to on surveys and discussions exaggerate the extent of their faith. And the United Kingdom, as we've noted, religion plays very little role in public discourse and when it does it is criticized and individuals are very are much more likely to understate the extent of their religious beliefs particularly when asked in a political context do you think this shows that the issue of religion and politics isn't about established religion and politics but is much more about civic culture and political culture yes in fact I'm not particularly comfortable with having an established religion but when you have one like you have Here it seems you have total tolerance for all faiths and none, and there are many more open atheists in Great Britain than there are in the US. Our politicians seem to always end their speeches with God bless you and God bless America. Here, the people would be laughed at if they did that. And that's one reason I prefer the British method. So to look down the table, Dr. of core. From the Sikh perspective, it is the Church of England sort of restrictive institution to the role that other faiths can play in the United Kingdom or does it sort of offer a view for other religions to be able to engage in politics from a theological point of view? Yeah, I think it's a really good question and also just going back to the point made of sort of in the opening remarks about this idea of tolerance. I think we can't really have a discussion about minority faiths and not take into account intersectionality. We can't, we have to consider the racial aspect. I write in my thesis about the double exclusion that seeks face in the dominant public sphere where the accepted norm is Anglicanism. And so you're not only excluded because of the religious hierarchy, but you're also excluded because of the racial hierarchy. And on top of that, policies that have been implemented to try and address this issue like multiculturalism have only actually instilled divides further. And so actually it goes some way to making that more problematic for people who, so not unlike the Jewish community, the Sikh community has to some extent either had to sacrifice what they might seem, what they might believe as being an authentic practice of their faith to adhere and fit into the good immigrant narrative or they are tarnished with the kind of radicalized extremist type individual with no actual consideration for the fact that there is a spectrum of people who are individual and as I go back to my lived experience of interlocutors that I researched, they talked about the fact that actually when neither of these two groups of people, you know, we go to school, we go to work, we participate in the broader public sphere, yet there are certain discriminations that exist. And I think to some extent, having this dominant church narrative that fits in the state, kind of, it has both, you know, positives and negatives, positives in the sense that it means that we are able to have dialogue about religion and faith more broadly, but on the the flip side, it only instills further these divides and actually who is the voice of religion and actually who were then selected. So if we just think about the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an interfaith task force that was set up for religious institutions and actually who were selected as the representatives for those faith communities. How were they chosen? Was it the actual community leaders or was it people who fit into the state narrative of actually, oh, you're a good representative because you do the things that we think you should do in terms of both religion and politics, hey, Sikhs, you do food banks, when actually the institution of Lunger, not free food, is in itself inherently political, which is obviously what you were referring to at the beginning, is that religion and faiths and groups of religions themselves are inherently political. They are political movements. They stand up for the rights of people. And so I don't see how you can talk about these two things as two things that don't intersect with each other in the same way that for me I can't talk about religion without talking about race because they are inherently part of each other and in Britain itself you know Sikhs are recognized as a racial group and that has now posed challenges down the line because we have lots of white you know nationalist groups that are claiming well actually if this religious group can claim ethnicity then sorry they can't claim that they are a racial group then actually why can't we do the same and so it leads to these kinds of tensions so I think that those are kind of my thoughts on that Professor Gordon, the Reformation, your area, England. Yes, belongs to me. Yes, I think this is very important. I mean, having grown up in Canada and then lived many years in Scotland, I've not come from a sort of state church culture, but rather one, which I find more comfortable, whether there is much more of a kind of fluid and even sort of dynamic and sometimes even conflicted relationship between faith communities and the state. I think one of the deeply problematic aspects of the Reformation, as I just referenced earlier, is this close alignment of religion with the state, then this idea of which created something, which I think has been an enduring inheritance of what is the norm and what is the standard, and everybody else is a kind of either a kind of variant. Just back to the question of tolerance that we had before, that only within certain circumstances can be allowed, to be part of the conversation. So I'm in, you know, I think this is a legacy of the Reformation which is deeply problematic. I also think it, that kind of formal relationship, if I may say it in here, is that that sort of formal relationship between the state and religion is actually very, I think, very unhealthy for religion. I think it's unhealthy for virtually everybody involved in this because it turns it into a kind of in many ways a kind of sort of sacral arrangement of the political in a way that I think religion is not intended. We were talking about before, political. I see the kind of political aspects of religion being much more in terms of its, you know, in my own tradition, and in the Jewish tradition, it's prophetic authority, its ability to speak. It's to hold both itself accountable and others accountable. I think that a close alignment with the state, raises a whole series of difficult problems. And now we have supposedly Christian countries because they have state churches in the West. And given the multiculturalism, the plurality of our societies, I think this starts to look very strange. Moving on then to religious beliefs in politics, I want to start with you, Professor Silverman. You referenced in your opening remarks, often cited examples of religious beliefs that impact politics in particular United States but across the world, picture on things like abortion, gay marriage, euthanasia, teaching about abstinence and contraception within schools. Do you think there is a difference and that we should distinguish between views on those things held for religious reasons and views on those things held for separate ethical reasons? And if so, why is there a distinction there? Well, when we look at what's ethical, we have to look at the big picture. People who are religious. who are against abortion, they shouldn't have one, but they shouldn't prevent women from doing what their doctor in consultation with the doctor says about it. So there's ethics and there's ethics. I think some religious views that they call ethical, to me, are unethical. So I think we have to examine carefully what their ethics are. And many of their ethics, and all, I agree with. And the liberal Christian ethic that deals with social justice issues, I favor. But some of the conservative Christian ethics that I see in my country, they're horrible, and they're not, in my mind, ethical at all, like preventing a woman from using contraception. They're using that as an ethical statement, which is just wrong. Is that not you applying your own subjective beliefs onto the ethical or ethical religious beliefs of other people? Well, I'm saying people can have their own ethical views and not use contraceptions, but when they're preventing women from using them, to me that's unethical. And yes, it is my personal ethical views, but isn't everybody's ethics, their personal views and what's right and wrong? I think we should have moral guidelines. Humanists have moral guidelines written on paper, not in commandments. And we like to follow those. Like my wife Sharon over here has a T-shirt that says, Be good, do good. And that says a lot of what we should do in terms of how we should act. And that to me is ethical. Some of these other things, I personally, think are unethical that conservative Christians are promoted. I suppose then we get into this question of can we separate the two. So when you have a politician who's running for office, they're going to approach lawmaking from the perspective of their own ethical beliefs, and the beliefs they hold for humanist reasons, secular reasons, or for religious reasons. Can we make a distinction between saying this person's beliefs about what they should do themselves on a secular level have more justification in politics than this person's views on what them and other people should do that they hold for religious reasons. Well, for instance, I'm comfortable with President Joe Biden, who's personally against abortion because he's a Catholic, but he knows the secular laws in our country allow for abortion. So I think a politician can have his personal views, but needs to follow what the law of the land is rather than putting his politics, his religion into politics and saying, this is my religion, so I don't want to allow this. But a politician is not there to make the law of the land? Well, politicians do make the law of the land. They can change various legal parts of what they believe. Like in some states, politicians. want to make abortion considered murder and put a woman in jail for having an abortion. That's making the law of the land. And they'll do that if Roe v. Wade is overturned. About half the states in my country want to do something like that. Is your disagreement then with their beliefs on, for example, abortion views that I'm sure that most people in this room share, or is it with the fact that they are approaching their politics around abortion based on religion? It's that they're using their politics to make laws not just using their personal religion to say what they should do. And I don't like the fact that they're making laws about everyone. I've even seen it, if you don't have a uterus, don't make the law about it. Don't try to prevent women from doing with their own bodies what they want to do, as long as it's still legal. Professor Gordon, another perspective from across the pond. Yeah. In certain ways, obviously, I see it somewhat similarly in the idea that certain particularly the idea that certain particularly hardline, the relationship between religion and ideology in here has become so. so close that we see very it's very evident we see politics where you know it's like in Florida where they see you know don't say gay you know there's that where certain perspectives have you know they've when in when in power they have used to impose on this on the other hand I think it's it's important for us to say that you know that we can't simply every every politician whatever part of the spectrum there on brings to the office a set of beliefs and convictions and nobody exists in a sort of neutral state of neutral beliefs. They all bring something very much to this. And I think it's impossible to imagine that people's religion is not going to play some sort of role in who they are and what they do. But that is not the same thing. I think we've been talking about this. We have to think about religion in very broad terms. thinking about this it's not simply a matter of doctrine or institutional power religion expresses itself in a variety of ways some which are extremely controversial in the sense where people have tried as we said to impose certain views on on other people I do know that would be a way of a present of religion and politics I find extremely well I would I would reject but I think that that that that the idea that if we suddenly removed religion from politics altogether, we would have some sort of rational debate that all would take place in a much more sort of moderate discourse. I mean, that has proved not to be the case just about anywhere. So I think in thinking about the way in which religion has been weaponized, particularly, you know, certainly been my experience in living in the states, is not my way of thinking about the ways in which religious communities can participate in political life, which is much more, and I'm as a historian very aware of the damage religion has done, but I believe that in our society that religious communities in conversation with each other in which they both hold themselves and others and politicians to account for their actions, not with one privileged over another, but in this conversation, something that we have very little of in our world today, that's a model of religion that I find much more congenial to a positive role in the wider political life of the community. But I agree. It's been made into a way where it's simply the imposition of certain very specific views on other people in the name of religion, and this has been a disaster. can separate between religious and non-religious ethical beliefs and political discourse? Yes, I do. I mean, I think, you know, that there's there, there is common ground, whether one comes to it from a religious background or not. I think there's, there's common ground in which people can share certain goals of social justice and a range of, you know, working in society for improvement, for international parity, all these questions. I think that there is, there are ways in which people who are who identify with religious communities can participate in those ideas of shared beliefs which is is separate from them imposing their particular religious views on others. Dr. Forakandau you smiled when I asked that question. Do you have any particular thoughts on it? Just in terms of I mean I don't wholly disagree. I think the point is it's very it is very hard for for individuals obviously to separate their beliefs from their political discourse. But I think it's very clear that we have learned consistently through history what happens when any one particular group believes comes to believe that their view is correct and seeks to impose it on others. And I think the relevance of bringing intersectionality in is I think really important to understand because it isn't just a question of a plurricular morality of views. It's about recognizing that different groups have different perspectives and there is a need to respect the different perspectives that people bring. And in this sense, it's not wholly dissimilar to what Professor Silderman was saying in terms of arguing for the right for different groups, whether they're religious, secular or other to be respected, to demand a level of respect for for their positions within their own particular groups and find a way of limiting that within those groups and not trying to further it outside that and impose it on others. That's where the problem really, I think, emerges. An example I thought about when Professor Silverman was speaking that I want to ask your opinion of is New Zealand, a highly secular country, very little interaction of religion in politics, has recently voted to try and ban the purchase cigarettes. for the next decade. Is that not an example of a secular imposition of a view on the populace? And should that be viewed differently to, for example, a state in Mississippi imposing a ban on abortion? Yeah, I mean, certainly I think we can think of those two in slightly separate ways. I think the imposition, correct. I think the imposition on an individual's rights clearly is very significant in both cases. but as a diehard feminist, I'm certainly more concerned by what's going on in terms of abortion rights. But undoubtedly, I think it's an excellent example, the whole premise of trying to build from tolerance, recognize the limits of tolerance, but then progress from there to understand the importance of respecting different communities, as I say, wherever they're coming from. And the importance of creating both back, boundaries and the possibilities for creating positive discourse between those different groups is the way in which we can begin to find the ways to create a respectful society. You want to do. Yes. I'm against banning of cigarettes because to me this is what happens in the US when they have a drug war where they ban all kinds of substances. And what happens is there's a lot of crime to get these substances. Personally, I'm against tobacco smoking and I would rather fewer people do it. But this should come through education, not through banning. For instance, the US, they don't allow advertising cigarettes on TV anymore. But I'm opposed to banning. Dr. Kohl, you mentioned in your opening remarks within Sikhism, there is no distinction between politics and religion. Does this mean that sort of generally in Sikhism you'd accept that, or it would be accepted that you cannot distinguish political beliefs and religious beliefs and secular political beliefs? Yeah, I would say so if we're using that terminology. But what I have to kind of go back to in the point is that it's not so, it's much more fluid than how we're talking today. And I feel like the way that we're all talking at the moment implies that religious beliefs and religions are static and politics and politicians are static when these are constantly changing topics and people and environments. But also it goes back to that point of, well, whose voice is prioritised? So if we look at politics across the world right now, who is in power and who are those people with those, let's say, extreme views or imposing those views? Actually, if we change the landscape of politics, we wouldn't be sat here having this debate about whether we're on. not religious views are imposing on other groups because I think like my colleagues here have said, it's this shared approach where faiths, religions, people of no faith, people of no religion, can come and have that discourse and dialogue because actually even within communities they have different views and approaches and opinions there will be Catholics who don't disagree with abortion. There'll be female Catholics who will be dealing with these on a day-to-day basis And we really need to take these factors into consideration because actually religions and religious groups as well as non-religious groups, groups in itself inherently implies some level of, you know, community. And we need to take these community approaches, bearing in mind there are individuals who sit within them with some level of shared value and approach. And that's also the same with all of us sat at this table today. We're all speaking from some level of similarity, but also with very different experiences. And so if we were to go into politics tomorrow, we will bring those experiences. And for me, that involves my religious beliefs. And that is not something that can be separated in the same way that I am also, you know, I now have a PhD. I can't separate that from the fact that I've learned certain things at a certain institution. It's not something that you can go and compartmentalize those views. I think it's just impossible to suggest that that's the case. Whereas, you know, rather than us talking about the kind of tensions between religion and politics, I feel like it's more that we need to talk about the tension of whose voices are prioritised. Why are we still fighting for female presidents? Why are we still, you know, referring to, you know, Margaret Thatcher as like the pinnacle of femininity or, you know, like, how was she treated? Actually, do you have to behave in a certain way to be accepted? And actually, how do we incorporate religion in that as part of the intersectionality? How do we prioritize different kinds of views and voices? And that's why I think you can't separate religion from politics. but that's also not to say that there should be a dominant religious voice or viewpoint. Like we've sort of alluded to here, you know, my research highlighted the problems with a dominant, you know, residual Anglican, British state and people who live in it that don't look like those kind of norms. So yeah. One very quick question from me before we move on. I just want to jump in there very briefly just because actually there's an interesting Jewish angle to bring in there, which is the way in which, if we look at the British context, what's fascinating is the struggle Jews had on some level in the dominant Jewish community in Britain, which is whose heritage is Western European, which therefore creates a perception of whiteness and facilitates the understanding that it is possible to integrate and therefore buy into the premises of of tolerance and reinterpret Jewish teachings in terms of Christian views in the dominant society. And so actually it's sort of, the Jewish community in Britain learned an awful lot, ironically, by beginning to understand the experience of different immigrant groups who helped challenge the model of monoculturalism, which had been so dominant. And ironically, British Jews failed to challenge that themselves, because of the perception of whiteness which impeded British Jew's ability to recognize their otherness. Professor Silvan very quickly. Just a comment when you talk about Judaism, some people might not know that a Jew is somebody whose mother was a Jew. And you don't have to have any kind of God belief. Like, I'm a Jewish atheist and there's a survey in the U.S. that the majority of Jews, do not believe in God. So we need to keep that in mind when we talk about Jews. One very quick question from me, because I'm aware I want to open up to audience questions, which is I don't think will provoke as much discussion, but I'm particularly curious to what our British experts think on this. Talking about the political landscape in which these discussions take place, do you believe there is an extent to which religious practices and religious beliefs become so integrated in the idea of a state that they stop becoming religious? example of this is I had a long discussion with my now ex-girlfriend, I'm from Worcestershire, in the countryside and in Oxford as well, but both the places where church bells are ubiquitous. And I timed my day often by the sort of hourly chime of the university church or the new college bell tower, and the same at home. And I was having this discussion by now ex-girlfriend about the call to prayer is not allowed to be broadcast five times a day in the UK for legal reasons. Is the fact that we accept church bells ringing sometimes every 15 minutes? Is that an example of religious discrimination? Or is it just the integration of a religious practice into accepted daily life? Anyone have any thoughts? Yeah, I'm happy to take it first. I think it's a really interesting viewpoint because I think this is, to some extent, the issue with what we were talking about having a country that has this residual Anglicanism. And so for that reason, yes, it's become embedded. But it's in the same way that Christmas and Eastman. to have and that we refer to terms as Micklemas and Lent when we're old institutions like Oxford or the London School of Economics and I think those have become those those are parts of that residual Anglicanism that still exists so whilst yeah I would like to say it's discrimination I don't think it's necessarily considered at that level of depth when these kinds of things are put into place and it's it kind of goes beyond that in terms of like that was not what the landscape of the state was like originally. But then there's plenty of countries all over the world who have their equivalent of church bells that will play and they will be the dominant form because that is the either residual or dominant form of faith there. So I would say in this country it's become sort of subsumed into that way of being and actually for some immigrant communities it is also their way of finding a connection with the place that they are. So many immigrant communities will celebrate Christmas and they will talk about Christmas because for them it's how they build a connection to Britain. You know, many immigrant families will have Christmas trees. Some of the families I researched have Christmas trees because for them it's a way of feeling like they belong in a place that's home where the idea of home doesn't exist in the same way because that landscape has changed and it will never return to that idea. So actually this is one way where they can form that communal feeling and bond. And I think it goes back to the earlier points of having these interfaith, intra-faith, conversations and discussions about well actually do you embrace all do you embrace non is it okay that we embrace some and actually i you know don't know if i should make this assumption but i feel many christians in this country would say easter and christmas given easter eggs and christmas have probably lost their true meaning in the religious sense of those festivities anyway so i'd like to say it's probably not quite as deep as that and actually there's more focus to be paid on certain areas that actually have more impact on people's day-to-day lives, so the law, for example, and how politics is, you know, who's accepted in those realms and spaces. Yeah, I think it's, sorry, go. I think it's, it's been really helpful in the conversation to, to get away from this idea, as you were saying, that religion is static, or politics are static, or that we, you know, I think it's not particularly helpful for us to think in terms of religious and secular, or these kind of dichotomies. I think they don't help the conversation very much. I think what we have to see, and I think precisely as we've just heard, is the sort of protein nature of religion and its relationship to politics, but its relationship to a whole range of things and the way in which it can be seen from, as we've just been hearing, for what are the implications of church bells for a whole range of different communities? They have many different meanings. You know, from my kind of historical point of view, I come at this and you say, well, these can seem now in a pluralistic and largely a society where, where Christianity is not nearly as widely practices, perhaps, you know, even 30 years ago, these can seem like, you know, ossified remnants of something that, you know, one could ask, has this actually spiritually died and is just, you know, what on earth are we doing this? What are we doing when Easter is an egg and Christmas is a tree? And, you know, what is it, what is it we're still doing? What actual, you know, one of the questions I would want is, what actually is this for a religion here that we're, that we're, that we're, that we're, that we're they're doing here. So I think I think it you know is I've been learning from my colleagues here it's it's these all these questions have to be thought about together rather than beginning a kind of either or conversation. Um, have anything to add or should I open up to questions from there? Right, sorry it's a bit late but any questions from the floor? The member in the blue sweatshirt over here. Thank you so much. It's been really interesting. so far. We said a lot about toleration, which makes sense. I think we're all pretty insistent that toleration is a good thing. What I'm curious is about is the flip side of it being a bad thing to introduce religious values onto secular culture, namely the idea that it's probably also bad to try and introduce secular values on religious culture. The question I have then is, to what extent does toleration also involve permitting religious beliefs, which might conflict with certain other secular values, faith schools that don't teach evolution, allow slaughter, circumcision. To what extent does toleration also entail allowing those? Very good question. Anyone want to come in for Professor Silverman? Well I think when it comes to evolution that's a requirement in secular schools. Now private Christian schools can teach without teaching evolution that's allowed and I think there's a problem with that for anyone who wants to later go into an academic area like biology so they're at a disadvantage and what I think is these people even if they don't believe evolution they should be required to teach evolution in a correct way even if they don't accept it but I think students are being given a disservice when they don't learn true science even though that does take place and it's legal in the US. Dr. Foykandau? I think the point I would just want to reiterate is that toleration is not wholly a good thing is actually the point I'm trying to make. The toleration certainly has played an incredibly important role in helping us create the societies that we have but the point is that we need to progress beyond toleration because of the imposition that inherently imposes on by creating a particular understanding of what what is the ideal against which alternatives are tolerated and so I think that actually goes so helps answer the question in terms of helping us understand that the discourse itself has to be broadened and it so and in order to achieve that, then of course it's necessary to provide a rounded, if we take the educational example, it's necessary to provide a rounded education and excluding any particular view entails this toleration which is exclusionary rather than inclusive and that's the thrust of where I'm trying to argue. The very term toleration itself, it comes with strong limitations. It means, you know, to a sense allowing something else rather than really engaging with it. I mean, you know, you spoke about Locke, I mean, excludes Catholics, excludes Jews. I mean, the notion of toleration has always come with boundaries. And I think I would absolutely share the view that getting beyond the language of toleration is actually an important step towards thinking about how we have systems of education and others that actually allow, enable people to engage with difference in a much more, in a much more fruitful way. Dr. Cordial to add anything, I'm sure just a really minor point. I think I fully agree with the comments that have been made so far. I think there's something to be said about teaching at such a young age critical engagement and critical reflection and discourse. So an ability to be able to make your own decisions. I feel like something particularly in British education you're not taught to think and particularly in you know private schooling and that domain you're not taught how to actually learn why you're learning what you're learning and how you're learning what you're learning and I think there's something to be said for actually being taught all of these different things and then being taught how to synthesize that information and decide what you want to believe going forward and I agree this idea of toleration I find the term tolerance really problematic because I think as human beings we have a responsibility to actually accept people for who and what they are and like my colleague here on the side has said it's not about imposing your beliefs on anyone else but we have a response as the generation that we are to educate the future generation and teach them how to keep developing. And like we said, you know, these concepts are not static and they change with generations, they change with all of these intersecting characteristics as well. And I think we have an important responsibility to sort of teach our future generations how to deal with that. I think part of what the question was trying to get at, though, is what happens when trying to teach future generations conflicts with our acceptance of who people are. of you, for example, the Berka ban in France, is that a sort of trying to teach future generations of women that don't need to live by these traditions that force them to dress in a certain way? Is that being progressive and educating, or is that instead not being accepting a few people are? Is there inherently a contradiction there? I think it might depend on whether these women are dressed the way they want, they are, because they're forced to by their husbands, or if they can make an independent decision to dress the way they want, then I think it's okay. But how can the law tell that? Well, I think it's, it is, this brings it all down to education, the role of education and the way in which politics exerts an influence over our educational structures. And that's one of the fascinating things to consider, if we compare the British and American systems, for example, because of the way, for example, the nature of an established church in Britain allows British system to support faith schools, which is fascinating and raises all sorts of issues, but really actually offers power to the state to ensure that in return for funding for state education, there is a required curriculum to be studied. But what that then entails, if we take the example of the Burkaban, is precisely giving individuals at a school level, at an educational level, the tools to make decisions for themselves, which means that you need to educate from both perspectives to enable people to have the agency to choose whether they wish to take on the burqa as a self-selected choice and see piety achieved through those means, but equally have the tools to be able to challenge and reject it. And one of the problems with people who wear burqers, they're often in countries where they're not even educated, so they can't make those decisions for themselves. I think we'd have one, I might run over slightly, but one more question, if you'll keep your answers brief, the member in the jacket, and she knows. Great, thank you all for coming. So in the 1930s, the German jurist, Carl Schmidt, wrote a book called Political Theology. and his argument is that any political belief ultimately is a theological argument. Now I can see the appeal of this looking at how the basic American political ideology works, because you sort of have saints. Martin Luther King, JFK, Abraham Lincoln. There is a sort of eschatology in so far as America had this manifest destiny of reaching from sea to shining sea. So I wanted to basically hear your perspective on even if politics and political ideas are not necessarily religious, that they have certain structural similarities to theological ideas. Well, just a quick comment when you mentioned Abraham Lincoln. One of the quotes I'd like from him is, when I do good, I feel good. When I do bad, I feel bad. That is my religion. Are all conceptions of feeling good and feeling bad, not entirely dependent on the fish bowl in which you grew up? Yes. and hopefully most people will be able to recognize what good is in terms of helping others. It depends on the culture you're raised and I agree. And I like the culture in which Abraham Lincoln was raised. Was that not an inherently Christian culture? Well, he was not a Christian himself. But the country is not a Christian country, but the majority of people, about 70% are Christians. And we accept some of the values Christians have that they make sense to us from a, they're reasonable. Others are not, so we just look at what makes sense, and that's how I think we should live. Taking it back to the question from the old member from Mexico College. So I think, yes, I mean parallels, yes, I think there are very strong parallels. there always have been between in questions of politics and well in my tradition of theology in this constant in terms of the nature of good the nature of community the nature of of what it is to to to live well these I think there's a whole range of central questions which of course in our tradition have been deeply influenced by particular religious traditions but I think that there's, you know, there's, there's very, very striking and important ways in which many of the same questions are being asked, even if people are coming to, you know, different perspectives on them. So I think that it's, it's not, I don't certainly adhere to, to Carl Schmidt, but, but I think, you know, there is, you know, they just come back to where we are, they haven't in many ways never been separated. Dr. Cor and Dr. Freud-Candell closing remarks. Before that, can I just make one comment that as an atheist, I really like how my other colleagues are acting in their religious faith and belief. So I thank you all. I think my comment would be that on the one hand, when we think from the perspective of the Jewish faith and its approach to the the role of politics and morality in society, there is clearly a central message that the Jewish faith is seeking to impart in political terms through its underlying belief system. And it all draws from its monotheism and notions of the creation of humanity in the image of that one God. And so on one level, that undoubtedly means that in political discourse there are theological influences which shape the way in which any sort of society is going to be structured. On the other hand, importantly, as I understand it, exactly what that model of Jewish teaching on monotheism and the like is intended to promulgate in the types of interrelations between theology and politics relate to the opening point that was made earlier with regard to Sikhism and the difficulties of clearly trying to demarcate the two and separate the two. Yes, so yes, they are intertwined, but the whole point when we come back to the underlying premise of a monotheistic religion and what it seeks to to incarcate is a sense of the shared humanity that we all have and that's the essential premise of the morality that a society can seek to follow accordingly. close our discussion Dr. Corle. Thank you, yeah. I think I'd really like to reiterate these points that have been made so far. And I think it's important that we just, we account for the fact that there is difference in everything, but there are also these similarities and this shared kind of idea of oneness that exists in the Sikh faith. And that we speak from that perspective and we behave in that perspective, which is why it's difficult to create these demarcations of religion and politics, because there are inherently realms that intersect and overlap, sorry, and one cannot exist without the other. And it's fundamentally part of the way that these lives are kind of lived and dictated. And that inherently exists in the way that people behave in the practice of their faith and beliefs. And so it's not something that can be extracted. And just to reiterate the final point that these are not static categories and they are not kind of distinct categories that exist in all, you know, religions. Just to say that they all have their own shared understandings and different understandings, but there is this important aspect of this inter-infra-faith dialogue and discussion that can take place to create that kind of understanding of, well, actually how do we prioritize and share views in a way that kind of goes beyond toleration and tolerance, but actually reaching a shared understanding and practice that allows people to be and behave in the ways that they want to, without feeling like they can't adhere or follow a religious belief and tradition, or be the kind of person that they want to be, or follow the philosophy, or belief system that they might choose to follow. Thank you very much. I hope you will find this discussion interesting and that it's helped you to think about how you're going to approach both your religion and your politics and your religious politics. Please join me in thanking our speakers to see this afternoon. Thank you.
