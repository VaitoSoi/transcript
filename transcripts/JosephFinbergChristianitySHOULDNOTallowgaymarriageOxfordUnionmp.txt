 Firstly, let me say thank you to the Honorable Lord Bishop of Dudley for that just warming, loving speech which moved even me an atheist. That being said, Mr. President, Madam Librarian, Madam Treasurer, Mr. Secretary, thank you for the and distinguished guests and members of the Union. It has been, thank you for this immense honor in what is my first Oxford Union paper speech. It's been my honor to serve you over the past months, and I hope to continue to dedicate to serve the Union. Firstly, I must introduce a caveat to my argument. From a civil rights perspective, of course, the Church should be compelled to perform marriage ceremonies for people, regardless of race, sex, national origin, or religion. This is in accordance with the law of my own country, the United States, and in accordance with basis. human rights to which all people are afforded by virtue of their existence. A church cannot morally or legally deny a gay couple of marriage ceremony any more than they would to an interracial couple. That being said, I would like to introduce by way of a historic graphic analysis the notion that marriage, as an institution, is and always has been a legal agreement. It is only due to the fact that prior to the Enlightenment, the lawgiver, had been the church, or shul or mosque, that there still is this notion that religion has any dominion over the institution of marriage. In fact, my good comrades, I would argue and hope to prove to you that marriage now has been fully ceded to temporal authorities and is therefore solely the dominion of secular courts. As such, to ask if same-sex marriage should be allowed in the church is in some ways a nonsensical question. I might as well ask if the church can issue of driver's license or do my taxes. As Wittgenstein once claimed, or rather the Honorable Natalie Wynne once claimed in one of her videos, paraphrasing Wittgenstein, some questions are better dissolved than solved. And I'm going to attempt to do just that for you. From first principles, I'd argue, I'd like to examine the history of marriage as an institution. You will see hopefully that law and the state developed in tandem to each other, in tandem with the institution of religion which oversaw marriage. Once these two institutions became distinct separate institutions, custodianship over marriage was transferred to the state. Marriage as a civil institution became a reality over the same time period that states began to develop as separate institutions from religion. Prior to this novel concept of the separation of church and state, religion had a more dynamic role within matters of state. The concept of religion as a purely civil institution, distinct from religious ones, is a modern institution. This is developed as states developed. This trend can be traced back to a number of historical events and developments, which I will outline now. I will not aim to address the so-called spiritual covenant of marriage as a scientist, like the Honorable Lord, Bishop of Worcester. Yes, I have not yet reached the conclusion he has reached, but my mind is open as a man of empiricism. I cannot yet concur that there is a God. I cannot agree that the agreement of marriage holds objectively any spiritual significance. I cannot concur that the spiritual realm even exists, but I can concede that there are vast swaths of people in the world that do believe this, and that do hold this near and dear to their hearts, that were raised with these values. Instead, I will focus on what marriage is and has been as a phenomenon, which is at its core a contract, and one of the first central organizing principles for society to organize themselves into families. In pre-modern societies, religion was, and the state, were not separate entities. Religious authority was closely tied with political authority. However, with the rise of class society, the state became more independent and separated from religious institutions, and religious authority was relegated to a purely spiritual realm. It is no coincidence that the Enlightenment philosophy developed in tandem with the transition from feudalism to capitalism. The world required a functioning rationalist philosophy that could make testable predictions. This led, of course, to the birth of empiricism. The separation from religious and temporal authority was an important development, as it allowed the state to establish a more secular and rational basis for its laws and regulations, including those governing marriage. In class societies, marriage was often the basis for economic and political considerations. Religious institutions were used to legitimize these agreements. This was a legal agreement, mind you. The church had to sanction the marriages of monarchs and nobles, and the materialist reason for this remains a constant. The church was acting as a legal entombed. presiding over the transfer of property and wealth from one entity to another. As society became more secular, the state began to take up this mantle, of giving legitimacy to contracts, and that came to the original contract of marriage. The French Enlightenment and subsequent revolution could very well be described as the great triumph of Lesothet, over the darkness and ignorance, which descended upon the world with a tragic conversion of Emperor Constantine to Christianity, and was nailed in with the rape and murder of Hypatia in 4.50s, The continent of Europe for the next 1,200 some odd years existed in a state of misery and ignorance. Scientific discoveries stalled. Scientific discovery stalled. Scientific discovery stalled. Physicists and astronomers were murdered for espousing the heliocentric model. It should be emphasized that it was not until the secularizing enlightenment that Isaac Newton's discoveries were made, none of our understanding of the natural world would have been possible. were not for the basic promise of secularism. The French Enlightenment and subsequent revolution were a Promethean event for the secularization of the world. The civil constitution of the clergy in 1790 effectively ended the relationship between the Catholic Church and the French state. Established marriage as a purely civil institution. The Napoleonic legal code, which was introduced throughout most of Europe, following Napoleon's conquest, further solidified the secularization of society by codifying a uniform set of laws that all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs, could be abide by. This included the governance of marriage. In Turkey, the Ataturk reforms of the early 20th century marked a significant step towards the secularization of society. The reforms were implemented by the country's founder, Mustafa Kamal Ataturk, may peace be upon him, aimed to modernize and westernize Turkish society and included measures such as the replacement... Pardon? Yeah, no. Replacement of Islamic law with a more secular legal code, With regards to marriage, one of the most significant reforms for the replacement of Islamic law with secular law. This established marriage as a civil institution provided over, not by caddies, but by civil justices appointed by the government. This was a good thing. By separating religion from the state, something my own home country, the United States should take a page for, out of Turk, treated, created a more equal society. A more just society, it was a more tolerant to people of all religious beliefs. and more importantly, on my point, took the governance of the institution of marriage and all contracts invested in the hands of neutral secular authorities. This is a historical trend. This is not an opinion. This is a trend. What other Promethean moments could I argue? I would argue the founding of my own country, which is the first truly secular nation in the world, where marriage is and always has been the dominion. No. The dominion of secular authorities. keeping this in mind you may now turn to the institution of marriages in the church. What legal standing, what binding legal standing does the church have to enforce a contract any longer? None. A church cannot make a gay couple any more or less married. As a church has no legal standing, therefore I urge you, my friends, to vote no on this proposition on the grounds that it is not a meaningful question. To ask if a church can perform a gay marriage requires the church to be able to be able to, to perform a legal contract, a legal marriage. A church cannot do a gay marriage any more than they can certify my taxes or issue a driver's license. Therefore, I urge you to vote no, as this is no longer a meaningful question.
