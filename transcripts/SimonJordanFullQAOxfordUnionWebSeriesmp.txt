 Thank you. Thank you. It's lovely to have you here. Lovely to be here in this wonderful institution that I could only dream of ever been able to attend. My experiences in education were to get turfed out of school at 16 years of age, which is not the blueprint for anybody. but it turned me into an idealist of the University of Life and School of Hard Knocks. So it's wonderful to be here. I've had a tour of the city. Many years ago, I had, and you'll get into this at some point, I had 250 retail shops, and one of the retail shops was in Oxford. I never saw it, but interviewed John Major's son, James Major for a job, didn't get it. Maybe his father shouldn't have got the other job. That's a different discussion. Anyway, lovely to be here and lovely to see you all. What's interesting that you start with discussion on the School of Life. My first question for you is that you began your career, setting up a pocket phone shop and expanded very quickly. What did you learn as an entrepreneur that you've used going forward? Well, I think you learn many lessons. Success is something that people attribute to people and don't understand the background behind it. Success is like an iceberg. You only see the top of it. The bigger part is failures and mistakes that you've made. And in order to be successful, whoever it is, whether you've had friends like mine, like Theo Paphethys that have been here and spoken about his successes, or you talk to Alan Sugar, or you even talk to people like Zuckerberg. They'll tell you about the successes in life, but they'll also tell you about the failures because it's important to be able to learn lessons. Most people that have been successful and had success, and I've had both. I've had great success. I've built a business in five years, sold it for the best part of 100 million quid when I was 31, and I've also lost vast swathes of money, and I've had business before. that were unsuccessful. Now there's a mantra that I don't subscribe to which is whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger and you know the next person that says that to me I should probably punch them in the face but the reality of it is what it does do is it gives you experiences and it gives you an outlook but the things that I learned about being successful is if you want to do anything in life I know there's something to be some controversy with influences talking about It's the same 24 hours in a day and everyone can do it. But I came from the background. It wasn't particularly wealthy. My father was a printer that worked on Fleet Street. So I had a union leader mentality. My mother was a beautician that worked in Vodalta Sousans. So she had a sense of style and awareness of the world. And I came from a background of a union leader or a union person, but B, me having an outlook of meritocracy. So I believe that the fastest route between A and B was a straight line, and the only thing that could really stop me was my own ambitions and my own desires. I didn't achieve huge things academically. I'm not advocating that to be the way to go. Six or seven O levels, this is a time in education when O levels were the benchmark, and there's obviously different grades and different attainment levels that have become more prevalence. But I had a very strong belief in myself. Now, confidence is something that you either fake it to make it or you have it from the outset. I had a confidence in belief, and some might say it's because you didn't know any better. So when I talk about the idea of failing and the sentiment of what doesn't care you makes you stronger, it does change your perspective, gives you scar tissue and muscle memory, which maybe takes away some of the things that you might have done when you were younger when you were braver. So what I had was an inherent belief because if you don't believe in yourself, then others won't believe in you. And what you do to believe in yourself is you avail yourself of knowledge, you avail yourself of the subject matter you want to be involved in, you engage properly with what you want to do, if you do something for want of a better expression on the back of a fag packet, and you don't do it properly, then you won't get the right outcomes. Now, of course you learn. You learn on the job. You learn for experiences. You've got two ears, two eyes and one mouth. And sometimes you should deploy that logic when you're listening to people or seeing what other people do. But you also have to be brave. You also have to be strong. You also have to be committed. There is no antidote to hard work. There is no, you know, there is no alternative to being committed to what you do. If you want to be successful and successful, Success comes in all different guises. I've done many speeches over the years at good or bad times in my life. When I bought the football club when I was 31, I became the youngest football club owner in the world, and it came with all the different baggagees of being very young and very strong in my view. But I also had a vantage point of wanting to go around and talk to all the schools that I went to when I was a kid, some of them that I got thrown out of, and suggest to them that there really wasn't anything that you, no, listen, without being disrespectful, you can't get a one-legged man to run a nine second, hundred meters. So I'm not going to take it to the ridiculous extreme, but you can always do things to the very zenith of your ability. And that's about being focused. And Gary player, a famous golf player, once said about luck, because luck forms a part of success. That the harder you work, the lucky you become. So you apply yourself. You learn the industry that you're big, or the challenges that you want to be involved with. They're, it's being an author. You know, when I wrote a book, I spent time with people that told me about the first chapters that I had written that I thought were really rubbish. They told me, I thought we're really good, and they told me were really crap, and told me why, and told me how to be descriptive and told me how to look at things, rather than talk about something very bluntly, describe it, make it flamboyant so that people can relate to it. But going back to your original question about what you learn, you learn to be fleet of foot. You learn. You learn to be fleet of foot. You You learn to, sometimes learn when to speak and when to be quiet. You learn to take good advice because ultimately advice is like backside. We all have one and we can all give advice, but it's the right advice that you take. But I think it's more importantly you look at whatever it is you want to do and you look at it from every angle. There's a lot of things going on in this world. You know, we talk about what's going on. We've set a landscape around COVID, for example. And we talk about the modelling. There's a lot of controversy about the modelling that's being used to the way this country is being run, and it's the worst case scenario that's being used. And in business terms, whenever I embarked upon a business, I would write a business plan that had three looks to it. There was a realistic business plan. There was an optimistic business plan, and there was a pessimistic business plan. The pessimistic business plan went in the draw. The optimistic went to the bank, if I needed any help, and the realistic set on my desk. And so you work to those models, and you think. think about what you're doing and you don't take no for an answer, you never let people tell you that you can't do something, you look at conventional wisdom and you see if it applies because the world is being disrupted by all manner of thinking now. Twenty years ago, we would never have said that Amazon would disrupt the high streets and the way that we buy things would be something very different to the traditional experiential walk into a shop and buy something. But you also have to be realistic. And I've never done, it's ironic, but I've never done anything in my life for money. When I have, which is a contradiction in terms, when I have, it's never worked for me. I've always done things to be successful, to be determined, to be better than the next guy alongside me, to learn lessons, to emulate. Having lived in America and lived in this country, I enjoyed living in America because the concept of what you achieve is based upon not where you came from or how you speak or what your background was, but what you can do. So I don't know if there's lessons in there But the main focus for me was I was determined The fastest route between A and B was a straight line As far as I was concerned And obstacles were not things that you stopped at And use as excuses The reasons why you can't do something They were things that you found a way through Over, under, across or around And it's those decisions that you make Because we'll all get opportunities in life That will define the level of success that you want And by the way, success isn't all about winning Winning. Winning is about giving your best and if you give your best in sports mantras, going to talk about winners. Winners in my view, and I have young children, so I speak the same way to my young daughter and my one-year-old son, if I'm a little bit tired tonight, has kept me up until 5 o'clock this morning, is about giving your best, and that will always be, you know, it's a bit platitude-based, but it's actually how the real world works. So let's talk about your motivation from moving from your phone shops to Crystal Palace. maybe an unlikely change in direction. What motivated you to do that? Well, I suppose you could say a fool in his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place. It was, I was very young and very confident, and when you believe that you've been successful in one industry, you think you can take those skills and put them into another. And you can, if you've got a big checkbook, you're prepared to learn in the same way that you learn the industry that you were successful in. I felt that football, my father had played for the time, team that I was wanting to buy. I had grown up supporting them. A hundred grew up in a little house, a hundred yards away from the stadium. And I felt that this was an opportunity. I felt that football would lend itself to my personality. I felt I had the strength of character to be able to do what it took. I felt that given my successes, or perceived successes, because success is all relative, that there was an opportunity in the sports industry because I saw the, the, the the direction of travel. I saw that the broadcasters were starting their engines, and I saw that football, soccer for any of our American friends that went here this evening, was going to light it up, and that there was going to be so many different associations and the broadcasters, as I say, were starting their engines. And I felt, if I get this right, then I'll have an opportunity to build, in part of my thinking was an entertainment industry, entertainment business that involved other businesses that got involved with just making films, a magazine that I owned, owning a restaurant group and a few other bits and bobs. Like most things, you know, sometimes if you don't know what you're doing and you lead with your chin, it'll cost you a lot of money. But for 10 years, it was a labour of love. It then became just a labour. And then it became something that I wanted to reflect. I wanted the reflection to be the one I wanted. It's a very difficult industry sports. And because I was so young, and at the time I was probably not as calm, and I'd like to think as wiser now than I am when I was 32, 33 years of age, you walk into a ballroom, and the average chairman, president, or owner is 60 years of age, and you walk in there at 33 years of age, you know, perhaps driving a Ferrari and smoking a cigar and thinking everything comes out of your mouth is important, you're going to find a few people that aren't particularly happy with that. But it was a choice because I felt, I played football once, my father played football, sports businesses are interesting. There's an element of ego. When you buy sports businesses, you look at the people that own them, you read about them in the papers now. The Americans are buying a lot of sports franchises in this country, and I use the word franchise because they are becoming franchises rather than just community assets. And people buy it for the benefit of association, for credibility, for recognizability, for ego. Perhaps if you're Roman Abramovich for one of the most expensive life insurance policies, but you buy it for your own reasons. I bought it because I was motivated to be successful and I thought it was the next step. And there were successes and there were failings, but there were lessons. And it took me on a journey of understanding what failure looks like because I lost a lot of money in it. And it shaped my thinking, and it shaped, and it probably matured me as a person because I didn't value money. don't value money, but money shouldn't be your driver. It should be part and parcel of the recognition of success. If you're good at what you do, I've never met a successful pauper. So the essence is to be good at what you do. Sports and specifically football in this country is a very difficult business, but notwithstanding it, it was something I wanted to have a challenge at. I believe that challenges are things that motivated me. And I thought, this is a challenge And it was a challenge. And as we see people from overseas buying into sports franchises, as you said, do you think that football fans still attach the same significance to club owners and managers? And do you think that they attach maybe more significance to people like yourself who've grown up locally within the club? Well, the cook, the candlestick maker and the baker that used to own football clubs, a local businessman that wanted to ride around the town in their Bowles Royce looking good in front of their cohorts, has gone because of the scale. football's gone through the ceiling. When I came into UK football, the best football club owners were the ones you never heard from. There was a book written by a famous footballer called Len Shackleton that wrote a book saying, what do football club owners know? And it was three blank pages about football. And it changed because I wasn't prepared to be sat there like some ATM for footballers and football managers whilst they just spent inordinate amounts of my money and told me to get on with the outcome. So I was very front and centre. So I probably changed the direction of travel for the profile of football club owners because A, I was very young and B, because of my attitude towards life, because of my personality, because I was very, I suppose, media friendly with the very strong soundbites and the manner in which I lived my life, whichever person was in my life at the time or whatever business venture that was always public domain facing, it created an interest. And then, of course, you then see the level of financial opportunity in football. And it's now become, you know, in 1992, when Sky, as a broadcaster, invested in football, they changed the landscape. And Romero Bramovich came over in 2004 and parked his Russian tank and sprayed cash around everybody. It changed again. And then Sheikh Mansour changed it again by buying Manchester City by just raising the bar. So multimillionaires like me become waiters by comparison in financial terms with people that have Middle Eastern money or nation state money or Oliarch money. So I've got a viewpoint that sports clubs have such a unique place in our society, specifically in this country. It's almost an ideal that they should have blue plaques above the door so they should have a special preservation status because too often too easily they're used for the wrong motivations and they forget the core principles of what made a football club. up in Newcastle recently, and you may follow, I don't know how much of you followed football, but there's been a very controversial takeover of Newcastle. I'm very much against it, because I think the regime that's owning Newcastle United are not the most edifying regime, but the former owner of Newcastle, Sir John Hall, who's a great man, 88 years of age, still going full tilt. And he talked about the value of sports clubs in the community, because sport is such a wonderful thing for society, not just at excellent levels, at grassroots levels, because it brings people together. It brings a sense of community and value and competitivity. And if you compete in sport, you sometimes compete in life. And I'm not suggesting that the blueprint should be, if you don't play sport, you can't compete in life. But there is a synergy about being competitive. There's also a synergy about a togetherness and a coherent spirit that sport brings. There's also the flip side of it. It's very tribalistic and doesn't bring some things that we're proud of. We saw some things in the European Championships in the summer that no one would be proud of, and that may well be reflective of the underlying current of our society for a variety of reasons. But I just think that there is a link that's been lost, because there is no relation. Don't tell me that Sheikh Mansour bought Manchester city because you like spending time in Moss Side or Roman Abramrich was desperate to bowl up and down the King's Road. They bought it for their own motivations and their own reasons and it's of course changed the landscape and the finances and the economics of football have taken it further and further away from the fans. So you have to go down the pyramid. The pyramid mean I mean the lower leagues in football to still get the value. But when you see young kids engaging in sport and what it means to them, then you should get your responsibility as an owner. And I think most of us do, some of us don't, or most of us being did in the past, but certainly most of us should, if we own football clubs, understand the inherent value of the uniqueness and the beauty of sports in this particular country. Do you think growing up so close to Crystal Palace safeguarded the interests of the club when you were owner, or was that motivation for you coming from elsewhere? No, I think it was incredibly damaging for me because, you know, quitting whilst you're ahead is not the same as quitting. And there was a time when it was right for me to leave the football club and stop writing checks out. But because I have a false integrity sometimes, I believe that if you take something on, you do it. And that makes me an easy person to deal with in one respect and difficult on another. But my responsibility, because having grown up with this football club, having been a kid climbing over the walls on a Sunday afternoon with my kid brother, doing things in the stadium that I shouldn't do, I'd say it was marking my territory for years to come when I was going to own it. Other people might say it was breaking an entry, but that's a different discussion. But for me, it was a responsibility that I took on. And when you saw what sports does and how it influences people, you should get your principles and you should get your values rights. But on the flip side of it, there was also a side of sport that isn't enjoyable, that sometimes it's a bit like the curtain being pulled back on the Wizard of Oz. And you sat there with some guy pulling all the bells and whistles, and he isn't really what you think he is. He's just to somebody in a little room making a big noise through a microphone. So I don't know if that's an answer, but it's how I feel, how I felt at the time. If I'd take me back now with all the benefit of experience, I probably might have done it slightly different. And you spoke about how football started as a Labour of Love became a labour. And you've spoken in the public eye about how you became disillusioned with it. Yes, I did, yeah. What was that process like as somebody that could grown up, your father playing for Crystal Palace, as well. Disappointing. But life is full of disappointments. I imagine in the world that we live in now, there's plenty of people that have far more disappointing things than I have. You know, you wonder around, I went to Poland a couple of years ago and walked around our switch, and then you get context, okay? So from my point of view, it was disappointing. It wasn't what I wanted it to be, and when you saw that the very people that are supposed to work alongside you, or the very people that often don't, you become disappointed. And also, when I realized there was a ceiling, I wasn't going to be able to get Crystal Palace to beat Manchester United on a regular basis, and I wasn't going to be able to dominate football as I'd like to have done. It became something that I found arduous. And of course, when you are commoditized as being a person that's only about money and your job, a good football club owner really is to write checks and buzz off and keep his mouth shut. That's what they really want. What they don't want is people to challenge the status quo. And I challenged the status quo. I dispelled the mythologies. I looked at the nonsense and I battled with the system because I didn't believe that it was right. And a lot of the things I said were right. But the trouble with people, people like me is if you challenge vested interest, they will always be a situation where they round on you. So for me to become disenfranchised, it was a disappointment, but life is full of them. And then it's about, okay, this isn't what I want it to be. So how do I try to make it what I want to be? Or how do I try to live with the responsibilities that I've taken on? At the same time, as maybe find my satisfaction somewhere else. Hence the reasons why I went into launching magazines or building a restaurant group that I wanted to build, or looking at one of your former guests, myself and Theo Paphethis, building a nutrition business, or looking at the film industry, all these easy industries to make money in that I felt were really sensible bets. So from the point of view of leaving the football club, it was a phase in my life. It was a learning curve. It was expensive. And it was a challenge. But it also gave me an opportunity to look at the media world, which I didn't really like and didn't really respect. and I have very strong views about the media because I think one of the most divisive things we have in this country is our media. I think 24-hour rolling news is one of the most evil creations that's ever been laid at our doors. And I think some of the problems we have in this country are laid firmly at the door of mainstream media, which is ironic because I know that I'm doing some work in the media, but it's never about being in the media, it's about how you operate whilst in it. So it took me through a journey, and it's about what you learn on the way. and an entrepreneur there's two kinds of entrepreneurs as inventors there's people that can see opportunities or there's entrepreneurs that see something and make it better I was an entrepreneur that didn't invent the will but tried to make the will better when I started my mobile phone business I had been involved with a company called the car phone warehouse you guys will all be familiar with my business you may be less familiar with but if you walk around seeing a T-Mobile shop every T-Mobile shop was one of my shops I worked with the car phone warehouse for six to eight months of Charles Dunstan because I'd lived in America. They had done a deal with an office superstore called Staples, who were an American business, and they asked me to get involved because of my understanding of the American psyche. Six months in, I thought I could do better than those guys, and went off and built my business, and the challenges that went with it. And it was all about, as I say, about finding the mechanism to be successful to the level that I wanted to be. So I don't know what point I'm making there. I think I'm making a point. Maybe I'm making it to myself. but I think it's all about the challenges you take on. How do you choose now what kinds of things you want to invest in? You've gone into various range of things. I think you're investing people. You know, I watched the rerun of Theo being here. And I turned down the first series of Dragons Den. I thought, I don't need that. What do I need that for? It's a crappy show on BBC 2. We're going to have no listeners or no viewers, right? I'll do one on ITV. That's absolutely crap. And of course I watched Theo to talk. talking about the investment criteria for the dragons. And it's very much that, people of any substance and sense invest in people. You get good ideas, a bad person, right? Get a mediocre idea with a good person, you'll be all right. And it's about, I've always invested in things that interest me. I'm not one of those where there's muck, there's brass and grind it out. And a lot of my mates, you know, one of my best mates, a guy called David Tabazil, who, by the way, you guys should have here because he's a bloody genius. He founded a tech bank called Derlika, founded Demon Internet, founded autonomy, found a video jug, being involved with businesses that have built net worths about 40 billion. And he does things like stay in his lane. Theo stays in his lane and deals with retail. I'm going to stay in retail. I'm going to run Ryman's, I'm going to run Robert Dyes. I'm a little bit more of a champagne person. I like to get involved with very challenging projects that have great risk attached to it. And that's a different dynamic, but if it's got good people, I like it. So I tend to look at projects that motivate me and inspire me and engage me. But I also, I'm very relaxed these days. I'm not chasing things. I'm enjoying doing the media. And the media suits me because whether I like what the media is or isn't, it is an influencer. And if you can use that influence well, I've sort of been dragged into the media kicking and screaming into the sports media. In a space, what sells in life, What makes money in life is scarcity. And I operate in a space. There aren't many Premier League football club owners. There's about 80 of us since the history of the Premier League. I'm one of 80, Premier League football club owners. So I'm in a unique space that I can talk about the industry of sport very differently than anyone else can. So what I do is I sit in this space and I look at the media world and I've never really had the will to do much more and have a bit of fun with it. I'm now looking at it saying, well, I don't think Joe Rogan's that great. I don't think Joe Rogan signed a deal with Spotify for $100 million. And I think I can do better than that. So now I've got the will. So now I'm looking at the way. And I'm looking at media because I know I'm content. Good content and bad content depend upon the listener. But I'm content. So I now want to own that content. So I'm now looking at a space. I thought that media was just words. But words changed the direction of thinking. We've just seen someone stand up in the House of Commons and recant a speech given to the knowledge. Neville Chamberl in 1939 about for all the good you've done, your time has come, stand down, for God's sakes man, and we'll probably see a Prime Minister fall on the back of words like that. So words are influencers. So I'm now beginning to look very clearly because I've had film companies, I've made films at good films and influential films and interesting films and successful films and unsuccessful films, and I've made theatre productions. Now I'm looking at the business more of how can I influence through the media. So that's my next direction of travel and it will centre narcissistically on me and we'll see how that goes. Let's talk about your career in the media from the beginning, if you don't mind. You started as a colonist and you ran into some controversy at that point of your career you were charged by the Football Association. I was, yeah. Well, I wrote articles for the observer and I wrote articles about sport and about how sport was really held together. See, people don't like the truth. They only like their version of it. And there's an alternate version, which is the real truth. And I spend my time with journalists who often don't know what they're talking about. So I wrote articles that were very strong, very strident, and very honest. And of course it brought me into confrontation. And at the time, I really didn't care. I was quite happy with confrontation. And I still am a little bit like that. I think there's nothing wrong with confrontation because it provides a spark, it provides thought, and engagement, and it gets people's creative juices working, and it also makes people work bloody hard. Why should people dial it in? Why should people get away of saying something and not being held accountable for it? Me too. So I used to write these articles in the observer, and of course it then put me on a direct collision course with the authorities. And I spent my life being in collision course with various authorities, being told what I can't do and what I can do, and then saying, oh, bloody, we'll do it my way, sometimes wisely and sometimes unwisely. So I started writing for the observer, which was great. I had a limited amount of time to want to do. I did 15 columns, and that was enough for me. After leaving football, I decided to write an autobiography and this will give you my view on sports the book was called Be Careful What You Wish For so you can draw your own conclusions as to some of the journeys that I might have been on but I wrote a book about my experiences in sport my experiences in life my experiences in businesses, my attitude towards life it became a bestseller which was great and very flattering because there's nothing more flat and I wrote it I didn't get it ghost written I wrote 132,000 words and after it had been reduced to get rid of the swear words and legal read it was okay It was down to about 125,000. And then the opportunity came about, I spent a lot of time in Spain, had a property company over there, building some properties a little bit boring. And I came back and I was approached to go into sports media. And the best sports media around is a broadcaster called Talk Sport. And I've spent the last two or three years taking it more and more seriously to the point now where arguably, some may say differently. We have the best, most listened to radio show with probably the best content. And so I'm enjoying it. And I think it's nice to be good at things. But I paid a lot of money to learn my trade and talk about the industry that I'm in. So I talk about it from a very different view. And I confront the world with experience of having done it. So when we talk about strong issues in sport and we confront things like racism or we have the players taking the knee and we talk about the Black Lives Matter movement finding its way into sport or the players believing that they're taking the knee to eliminate racism from sport and yet I owned a football club in one of the most multi-ethnic parts of the country with a multi-ethnic team and representation wasn't something I didn't want it just wasn't something that was unavailable because the communities themselves weren't engaging and that's not racism that's just something different So I talk from those points of view that engage people's thinking, and you've got a narrative in this country, you're watching it through the mainstream media, you're not hearing what you should be hearing, you're not being told certain things, and you're seeing alternate news platforms pop up like Gbby News, and you'll soon see talk TV that's being set up by Rupert Murdoch. Now, I know Rupert Mordock will have his own way of doing things, but you're going to see news challenge what's going on. And I think we have a right, and people should have a questioning mind. work out what's true and not be false-fed a way to look at the world. And the BBC's and the ITVs and the skies of the world have waged a campaign that we're living through of fear, fear, doom, doom and more doom. And I personally don't like that very much. And I think there's an alternative way to look at the world, an alternative way to look forward. We have a generation coming behind this that people have a responsibility to. And the generation that's coming, this generation, your generation have a challenging world, a world full of opportunities. And I think there's going to be some interesting changes and some interesting landscapes. So from that point of view, the media world interests me and engaged me, but only, and the beauty for me is I'm economically set so I can say things in the media without my career being determined by a council culture or a mentality of people not liking what I have to say and finding a way to de-platform me. What do you think we should be asking for from major media outlets now? integrity, honesty, a lack of bias, balance. You know, I've sat on, I've done shows, I've done questions, I won't do question time because it's crap, it's nonsense, it's binary, it's rubbish, and I won't sit on a panel with low grade of politicians that shouldn't be in these jobs because there's no benefit of association to me and I don't want to demean myself by sitting next to somebody that shouldn't be in a job. And our politicians aren't being held to account. Where are the great interviewers? Where are the Brian Walden's of the world? Google him after you've listened to this, that we used to interview Prime Ministers like Margaret Thatcher and ask them questions. Where are our leaders? We live in a country with a vacuum of leadership because people are too, the fourth estate has got too much power. It's got too much influence. And I know why that is because social media has started the trend and the mainstream media is coloring in the gaps because it needs to keep up. But we should be expecting more. When you watch, whatever your persuasion, whatever your views on Brexit were, right? every single panel that was convened on the BBC, you'd have three remainers and one lever. And that's not a fair balance in a discussion. And the BBC's persuasion was to illustrate a certain view. Now, everyone's entitled to their view, but it's also entitled to be debated properly. Why don't we have proper debates about the landscape of what we're living in? Why aren't we talking about COVID properly and the experiences that we've had, whether it's vaccines for young people, whether it's natural immunity? These conversations get shat-down and people get deplatformed and they get vilified. And why? And why should they be? Because it doesn't suit certain people's narratives or it doesn't suit the agenda of vacuous leaders that don't have the courage of the convictions to really lead and to really be an example to take the next generation with us and all the achievements that the next generation will have in a tech world that's going to change the way everybody looks at the world. Look at the world. I remember selling mobile phones 25 years ago. where the concept of talking to someone was to call a kitchen wall. That's how you wanted to speak to someone. You called a kitchen wall. Or you've got a pay phone and arranged to meet your mates somewhere or another. Now, everything you do is done from a mobile phone, and not even I that sold a million of these buggers envisaged that mobile telephony would be what it is. So you guys are the next generation that take it, but you need to have people that facilitate that. And our politicians tragically think they're pop stars and think that what they have to say is any substance, but they don't have the substance because they don't have the courage of their convictions. And you came into media from a different point of view. Yeah. What have you learned from being in media compared to, I suppose, doing the sports and what you've been talking about before? What have I learned from the media is that it is an influencer. And whether I like it or I don't, and I am very fortunate that I work for a broadcaster that allows me great latitude, fortunately for me, And I'm also able to argue my way in and out of very controversial subjects that most people find as taboo. You know, whether it's policies around political landscapes, whether it's the thing I touched on earlier on, the situation around race in this country. Because I want to question, I think we should have a thirst for knowledge, and we shouldn't just accept what people tell us. You know, whether people make the accusation about institutional racism and someone makes an observation about it and tells them that institutional racism is represented by more black women dying childbirth, and I want to know what's behind that statement and question it to understand why that thinking, so I can learn and I can expand my thinking. But what I've learned with media is that it has influence, but it needs to change, and it needs to change dramatically, because it's disingenuous and it's dishonest, and it's biased, and it's disappointing, and it's full of very average people that are nicking a living, that don't have the courage to do anything meaningful, but also it's polarized by people's persuasions. There's good in there, and there's going to be changes. And when you see people, whatever, you think of people like GB News, I'm a little bit biased because my partner is a broadcast on GB News, but I see some of the good in that platform. I see some of the crap on it as well. And I also see the challenges that are coming for the mainstream media. I don't like the fourth estate running this country. I believe it should be run by those that are put into running and not newspapers and not influences. So my journey through the media is not to take it too seriously, not to take myself too seriously, to be honest and to be brave, even in the face of not necessarily conforming to the public narrative, a popular narrative, not doing it just to get clickbait and to be centre of attention, and to try and to, in my little field, which will move from sports, into societal, into economic, into political, because that's where I want to go and to have influence in there, is to tell people something they didn't know, but also to be honest and to give people an opportunity to see things properly, rather them through an agenda. And I think the media can do that, but I think there has to be better controls over certain aspects of it. Well, it seems like the perfect time for me to open up to the real interviewers, our members, but I'll ask one thing before I do. What's next for you? I was talking to Tom on the train about that. I'm very relaxed about it. I have a beautiful one-year-old son, and I want to see the world through his eyes a little bit. So I'm happy with looking at media, looking at the content opportunities it exists for me, and maybe taking him to a few football matches and seeing what he thinks about, what his dad once did. And maybe another book. That's what I'm potentially working on. Great, we look forward to it. Do we have any questions from anyone here? Hi, Simon. If you just wait for the microphone from there. Thank you. Thanks, Molly. Thanks, Simon. That was absolutely fantastic. So thanks. It was a real pleasure to listen to you. I'm just to introduce myself. I'm Daniel Harrison. I'm a second year history and politics unit at Worcester College. So I just want to ask, if you and Crystal Palace aside, I know you love them, but if you look at the 20 Premier League clubs now, is the one club that you look at and you think organizationally and structure, they're very well run and they're a very professional outfit and you think you know I'd love the opportunity to own them at some point other than Crystal Palace thank you well it's I suppose you look at it from a different perspective you can look at new additions to the premier league like granford with Matthew benham having built a club with the moneyball mentality of looking at quality of player against cost of player against points per pound spent you look at Manchester city and say well they win you look at Liverpool and say heritage livery spend pattern, spend lots of money, but recoup a lot of money, spend 150 million pounds on players, but having sold Philip Coutinho first for 150 million, so their net spend is very little. It's difficult to say I admire anyone. I've never really spent my life admiring people. I've never had any role models. I've had people that I like and like to listen to, and we're all guilty of that. We like what someone has to say, so we like them, right? And we agree with them because they agree with our thinking. But I've never been a great admirer of the football world because it's a lot. It is, sometimes when you pull the curtain back, it is a banana republic sometimes. It's held together by gaffer tape, bullshit, and money. Those are the three biggest commodities in sport are gossip and money, and they go in equal measure at times. But I suppose if I were to look across the lexicon of sporting clubs in the Premier League, I'm not going to give you a Premier League club answer. I'm going to look outside of the Premier League and I'm going to go down the pyramid and say, if I'd have bought a football club in the north of England, and I have to be very respectful of the north of England because my son was born in Hull. I wasn't happy with that, but he's born in Hull, so God's country, God's country. And you look at clubs like that and you look at clubs like Sheffield Wednesday, you go, wow, look at the potential. And the energy that those fans, in London, it's a little bit like, well, I can go to the football, I can go to the ballet, I can go to the theatre. In the north of England, with no disrespect or profiling or idea of leveling up, there's a real passion and a football club really does represent the cornerstone of the community. So somewhere like a Shefford Wednesday or once upon a time of Leeds United, which was a football club that whenever my team played for them, always scared the shit out of me because it was such a big club with big fans. So it's an answer. Any other questions? Yeah, the member in the brown jumper. Hi, Simon, thanks for coming. It's a pleasure to have you at the Union. I've got two questions, but they're somewhat related. So one, you mentioned being on a journey through life and that you've had a myriad of success and failures. So how did you deal with the difficult times, the times where you weren't as successful as you would have liked to have been? And added on to that, did you enjoy the process? I'd like to give you the Rajad Kipling answer that I treated both impostors the same. But it didn't. I took success in my stride and failure quite hard at times because it wasn't something I wanted to have. And I looked at it objectively. It depends what kind of failure you get involved with. The successes for me were a natural progression to what I was building towards. I didn't start something so I could fail. So when I was successful, for me, with my personality, it was, okay, I've got here, I'll get there. Okay, I've got to get there. So now I'm here, I've got to get there. And each one was an assumptive close on my perspective. By that, I mean, I had done it in my mind by conceptualising it. So when I did it, it was a given to me. And it was always chasing something, which makes you not appreciate. Because I was much younger, I didn't appreciate it. And I look back now, a bit like without getting too. prosy. I look back like the character out of Shawshampe Redemption, wishing I could talk to myself at a time in my life saying, well, geez, Louise, appreciate that for that moment in time. Look where you are. You'll just won the Premier League. You just won the Plow Final to get into the Premier League against all the odds. Enjoy it rather than think, what's next, what's next, what's next? What's next? What was the second part of your question? Did you enjoy the process? Did I enjoy the process? Well, I think the answer is in the same vein. I, the happiest time of my life was building towards success, never the success. It was always, always the hunt, never the kill. Now that's not an adage I would advocate because you really do need to take those moments. And there were moments. And I think life is about finding, without getting too verbose, is about finding contentment in whatever you can find contentment in. And I can remember twice in my life being contented, that's pretty pathetic. And I can remember where I was when I was contented. So contentment is the thing that you're chasing, and whether money or success brings it to you, I didn't enjoy the process enough, and I should have enjoyed the process. It's not a regret because you do what you do. It's a scorpion and a frog. You are what you are. You can't unwind it. The very things that you do define you. But I wish I'd enjoy the process a little bit more. Because, hey, 31 years of age to make 100 million fucking quid, and it was all mine. And I can do what I want with it. excuse the language, but that's a place to be. And I could have gone on and built other things. But I enjoyed a lot of other things as well. And I enjoyed, the biggest enjoyment I got was the difference it made to my family and to the lives, to my parents, and to my siblings that I could securitize, give them opportunities and make sure their lives are better. And there's something to be said for that. It's not me living vicariously through their happiness, but it was something that I gained more satisfaction from than buying nice cars or buying nice boats or living in big houses or travelling first class. Believe me, those things are nice too. And from the member in the black coat just here. Hi Simon. Do you remember back when the sort of super leafing happens? Yes. Steve Parris, someone you speak very highly of. I don't. We're not on Sky Sports. He sold my money. And he basically said, he was asked about the Super League and he basically said, well, ideally you want the six clubs back because we kind of need them. Now, as a villa fan, I wanted them kicked out because obviously that would have been good for us? What have your response been? It's a fact of life. I mean, unfortunately, the biggest opportunity for, I believe that the football world should take control of its own destiny and not be selling its rights to the broadcasters is a proven concept, build your own platform, deliver your own content because you've got it, it's your content, market it, do a Netflix model, get 100 million subscribers, charge them 10 quid a month, you've got a billion and a half a year, or actually 10 billion a year, rather than 7 billion every three years, or 8 billion every three years. The challenge is, is that the next territory that's making money for the broadcasters because the domestic market is tapped out. There's too much churn, too much competition, too much piracy. Piracy exists because the price point's too high. People are taking IPTV and models like that because they're not. They don't want to pay the price point. That's dangerous because behind piracy, organized crime, and we don't want that. But the price point is driving things. The next landscape is the overseas rights, and the overseas rights are not bought on watching Crystal Palace. They're not bought on watching Brentford. They might be bought on watching Aston Villa. When Ashton Villa rock and roll with Stephen Gerard, that might well be the case. But right now, it's Liverpool, Man United, Man City, you know, Chelsea, Arsenal and Spurs. What they tried to do was not wrong, the mechanism they deployed to do it. Why would you want to give your money to corrupt divisive, this reputable organization like UEFA as if there's some sort of standard bearer? They're not. And neither are FIFA. There's more corruption in FIFA than there is in Wormwood Scrubs. But the bottom line is, is that they have established the mechanism they used, which was no meritocracy, stank. They should have done it better. And for those guys that got off a seat to start a fight in boxing terms, the bell rings and they sit back down again is pathetic. They even want to have a fight. The real reason is J.P. Morgan didn't put enough money up. That's a different discussion. But it has to happen because you cannot, the train has left the station. You cannot stop these players getting paid the kind of money they're getting paid. And it won't stop when you've got, you know, Oliaks and you've got Middle Eastern nation state money that doesn't care. They've got their own reasons for owning a sports business, whether it's sports washing or whatever it is. They don't care. And the governance doesn't have the balls to securitize it. So Parrish was right and wrong, and he's a smart guy. We don't get on because he took something that belonged to me, but that's a different discussion. But he's a smart guy, and he talks about things in a smart fashion, and so would I if I'd made more money out of a football club than made it anywhere else. I think we have time for one or two more questions. We'll go for Tom and then the member at the back after that. Just here. Thanks. Hey Simon. So one of the characters in life right now currently is Donald Trump, and he's a leader. He's quite often controversial, and he speaks his mind. And you, I'm not saying you two are the same, but quite often your speak, what you always do. What are some of the lessons that we could learn in terms of leadership? Because real leadership, whether people think they're right or wrong, is a rare commodity. and also in terms of the media aspect. So he handled the media in many ways because it was kind of him against them. You've had similar situations. What are some of the lessons that you've noticed from him? And also another question, second part of that question, would you ever consider running for political office here in the UK? As you know, I met Donald Trump very briefly, a boxing fight many years ago. He's a very engaging character. And I think he was a revelation in lots of ways. There was lots of toxicity and lots of stuff about Trump that wasn't right. But what he did was he broke up the political bullshit in America and dusted these politicians that were career politicians that nicked a living that thought it was an easy dial-in and he broke the mold because a commercial man, the world turns on money and Trump understood that and he's a deal-maker and a deal-doer. He was elected via media, via social media. And so he was a leader. I don't think some of the things, I don't think his demise at the end was right the way he handled himself. I don't think that the media were fair, but if you're going to constantly keep spitting in the eye of CNN or whoever else it is, you're going to find yourself foul of it. But I think he brought about a real sea change in the thinking around politics because we have career politicians in politics. And I know this sounds like a particular hobby horse. But when you hear, we don't have the best in class. Politics is a big person's job, a big girl's job or a big boy's job, not a rank amateur's job. And when you listen to people that are in past positions of authority, none of them are particularly competent. They talk about the idea that they get paid 80 grand a year and that should be sufficient. If you want the best in class, you've got to pay these guys proper money to get them in the door in the first place to make big decisions. And I watched the other day on question time, a Scottish National Party member talking about how everyone should be able to live on 80 grand a year. Well, I looked at your background. You were a researcher. You've now gone from 40 grand a year to 80 grand a year, so you think all your lotteries have come at once. but you need real people at the top of their game. And if you get somebody that works in industry, that's an half a million pounds a year, to come into politics and you only pay them 80 grand a year, they can't live, they need a second job. And this is why Boris Johnson's bang in trouble, because Boris Johnson decided to back Owen Patterson, rather than be a leader and tell him to sit down, shut up, take his medicine, and get back into office in 30 days' time. And we now find ourselves on the precipice of a world of problems, not just because of that. Boris has done some silly things. But leadership is about really You've got to pick your horses You've got to pick the people around you If the only person you can point to in a room for a good idea is yourself You're going to run out of ideas soon And you're going to be unsuccessful So you need to surround yourself with good people But you need to lead and you need to be courageous For me going to politics I've lived an event for life And I think the events in my life might find me Find me having trouble with certain sections of the media who would love to have a go at me because I spend my whole time in the media having a go at them, telling them all but I know nothing, a bunch of nitwits they are. So it'll come my way. But to be able to affect a change, there's a part of me we would like to, but I look at the landscape and I look at these politicians, I look at the system and a rigged system that currently is now, unless you're going to change the system from first past the post to proportional representation and things like that, it's going to be always difficult. I don't hold the values. I'd never voted for a party. I voted for a policy and a leader, which means I've voted for Labor and I've voted for conservatives. I've never voted for the Lib Democrats because that's a wasted vote as far as I'm concerned. But the political landscape interests me, but I'm getting to a stage in my life, I'm probably getting too old anyway. But I watch it with a great deal of interest. I've got a partner that stood two or three times in elections, and I watched the wonderful experience as she got with some of the people in momentum in labor and some of the abuse that she took. but that doesn't mean it isn't to be done. So I would never rule it out, but I don't see it as something that I'm aching to do. Thank you. Hi, Simon. Thanks coming to talk to us today. You've sort of had a, you talk about, you know, money makes the world go round. And to take it back to football, you had a quite sort of a 10-year period where money was so much on the rise. Could anything have been done to stop what's happened now in terms of the amount of money in football, should anything have been done, to stop the amount of money that's in football now? Effective leadership. How could that have been done? Well, you know, if you look at the FA and you look at the people that are purported to run our sport, and you look at those guys that are often there for the wrong reasons, you need serious people to do serious jobs. And whether sport is considered to be serious or not, if you're in that world, do it well. If you look at the gap between the Premier League and the Football League, it was allowed because the Football League had rank amateurs that were not capable of doing their jobs. When you look at the advertising of the Premier League, it's bells and whistles. When you look at the advertising of the Football League, it's an old geezer with a rattle. It sort of impetamises the mentality. But the Premier League, they're powerful. With the ownership models that have come in play, there was always going to be challenged. But it needed to be done properly. There's nothing wrong with the talent getting the money. But sports should be run in a way where it is economically viable. And it's not economically viable. It's lunacy. You're getting footballers getting paid 400,000 pounds a week. And you're getting surgeons that do something really meaningful that would get nothing like that. And I don't like to do the analogy between what a sports person gets and what a person in everyday life gets, but come on now. And these players think they're getting underpaid. But the scale of the opportunities there, if you look at the Spanish, they've changed their system and they're prepared to make the big clubs in Spain suffer for the time being, Barcelona and real big. just so they can get the system in order. A lot of that's to do to react to Paris-San-Germain and the Middle Eastern money and to deal with Sheikh Mansour and Manciti because they will just, they have the cash to turn your lights out. But it needed effective leadership. Like we needed effective leadership through the last two years and we haven't had it at times. And I am many things and lots of things about them are wrong and some of them are right. And I think you have to be definitely in your life, definitely right or definitely wrong, ideally definitely right, but definite all the time. And too many people flip-flop, too many people don't have the courage of their convictions. It's the word that I've used many times in this time that we've been together. But it's real because leadership isn't easy. It takes people that want to be, to have the bravery and to have the commitment and to have the honesty and the integrity. And those are the cornerstones that make a. leader and too many people play at things and the football guys play it they're more interested in what it looks like than what it takes to get it done and we're in danger of losing aspects of our game and aspects of sport in this country because of the lack of leadership and when I sit there watching it because I've done it I've done it I've sat in a room with these people and I've done it it's disappointing and people like me probably won't get an opportunity because I frighten people because I will call people out and I will fight with people to get what's right. And there's not enough people wanting to do that in our politics, in our everyday lives, and in our sports. Thank you so much, Simon. My pleasure. We'll finish with the... It's got mugged by a polar bit on the way in. We'll finish with the question that we've been asking all of our speakers. If you could give our members one thing to take away to think about this week, what would that be? If I could give your... I think the future is your... I think you are in such a fabulous environment. I'm sure this is a sort of formulaic answer, but you have the opportunity to be whatever you want to be, whatever that is, and never let anybody on any level tell you you can't do something. Never let anybody tell you that you can't do something. Whatever it is you want to do, we don't all have to make money, we don't all have to be politicians, we don't all have to be successful to a level where people bow and admire our achievements, but we all have to be honest with our lives and never let people stop you from doing anything you want to do because there are no barriers. I don't care about some of the stuff that you've seen in the media about this silly girl that was an influencer that made observations about her 24 hours, the same as everyone else is. But in essence, she's right. You can do whatever you want to do in your life. You can be successful, you can be motivated, live the best life you can. Be the best version of yourselves. Thank you very much for coming.
