 I now look to Isra Khan graduate officer to open the case for the opposition. Thank you very much Madam Speaker for giving me the opportunity to speak in this historic chamber tonight. 60 years ago, between the spring of 1959 and the end of 1961, around 30 million Chinese people starved to death. By 1978, roughly 850 million Chinese, two-thirds of the population lived under extreme poverty. All this, at the cost of Mao's attempt to bring a more Chinese form of communism, where local industries were taken under the state control, and farmers were brought under the collective. But fast forward 2021, China's poverty rates fell from 88% to 0.7%. Thanks to the institutional reform and the ideals of capitalism, such as free market economy, and the mass consumerism, that millions of Chinese people came out of poverty. This is not to say that China is fully capitalist, not at all. So much attention is already paid and will be paid to the deplorable factory conditions in countries like Pangolitan. Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, that it is easy to forget in this mist that how the role that the consumption of capitalist consumers have played and lifting masses of people out of poverty. Ladies and gentlemen, a lot will be said about unethical consumption. But before that, remember this. The burden is on the proposition tonight to prove that there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Whereas on this side of the house, all we have to argue is there some ethical consumption exists. We are not saying that there is 100% ethical consumption. Neither are we arguing that capitalism is perfect. It can never be. In a classic debating style, I'll be making two arguments in support of this motion. But before that, let me introduce the speakers tonight for the proposition. Speaking first, you heard from Alex Fish, who is a second year history student from Hertford College. Well, you heard he's proudly elected member of the standing committee and very famous among the Union Circle. Now, Alex comes from Dundee in Scotland. I studied in its neighboring city, Aberdeen. The two cities have a very much old football rivalry, and I'm here to settle this forever and say on his face that Aberdeen Football Club is way better than Dundee. Speaking second for the proposition tonight is Noga Levi Rappaport. I did try, I asked her how you pronounce it. This is how it is. I'm sure it is. A climate activist and UK student climate network speaker. Now, Noga has led and mobilized a number of climate strikes across the UK in the world. Well, ladies and gentlemen, she is the reason that young people are missing school. But it is unfortunate, in fact, to see her on their side because her very climate activism demonstrates that young people today, the capitalist consumers today care about ethical issues. Speaking third for the proposition is Tom Burgess. Tom is an award-winning investigative journalist working for the Financial Times. He has published two books, Cleptopia and The Looting Machine. I'm sure he has come here to use some cherry-picked quotes from his fancy books and to make you feel guilty about your choices. But the irony is he works for institution that's the very product of capitalism. And if you see on the Financial Times website and it says that our audience segments comes from top leading corporate executives and high worth individuals. How much moral authority does Tom have to lecture you on your ethical choices is for you to decide. Fourth speaking for the proposition tonight is Barthi Patel who's a human rights activist and she has helped to set guidelines for the fair treatment of workers and the prevention of modern slavery. I did to look a lot, to find something about party, so I can roast her. There was nothing. I'm sorry, she's boring. Madam Speaker, these are your speakers, and they are most welcome tonight. But before I go to my first point, keep this in mind, and I'm also eagerly awaiting to see how How does the proposition justifies their own consumption choices of using products from the very corporation they will be criticizing the iPhones, the Samsung, the nice, lovely jewelry? I suppose someone in Bangladesh built there. Moving to my first argument in support of this motion, there is ethical consumption under capitalism. And I'll prove this by focusing on poverty reduction. But what is ethical consumption, ladies and gentlemen? Much of ethical consumption today is concerned with social, political, and environmental context of an object. We consumers are now expected to address a wide variety of issues through the power of our wallet. Now, there has been a drive for ethical consumption. Many consumers, as you may be them, expects businesses to play a positive role in society and feel that when it comes to driving positive, change, brands bear as much responsibility as governments. And no gas climate strikes are the very example of that. Statistically, well, globally, sustainability is rated as an important purchase criteria for 60% of the consumers. A global report from the Economist Intelligent Unit Commission by the Worldwide Fund shows staggering numbers that it is 71% rise in online shopping for sustainability, and and sustainably produced goods in the last five years. But have we really made ethical choices? Well, let's see. Who over here has purchased clothes from brands like Zara, New Look, Primark, and H&M? I purchased my clothes from Primark. Surely, Madam Speaker, that is a Zara dress, but it is not because I did ask you. But did you know, as Alex said, that these clothes are really built in manufacturing countries like Bangladesh. But did you know there is your demands for garments that has played a significant role in economically uplifting vulnerable people like women who are in unemployment over there? Our 80% of garment workers in Bangladesh today are women for young women and workers with limited skills and education. Your consumption has provided them the opportunity to transition into formal jobs with regular wages, giving them control over their lives, and repelling them from the shackles of early marriages. This is what your consumerism has done. This is just one example. Hold your horses. This is my time today. This is just one example. This is just one example, ladies and gentlemen. There are hundreds of examples like this where your consumptions can help elevate people from poverty. I come from a province in Pakistan where 40% of the people live under the clutches of poverty. Now, if a single corporations, like Zara or Newluck, decides to set a factory in my province, I will be dancing on one foot, literally dancing, because of the opportunity it will bring to the people around me, because of the employment it will bring, ladies and gentlemen. Of course, the opposition will argue of the deplorable and the miserable factory conditions. They argue about child labor. I'm sure Barthi will go into details of child labor that comes from there and this child slavery. I don't disagree. There are corporations that violate human rights, the basic tenets of decency. But these cases more stems from weak governmental regulations and weak enforcement mechanisms, mostly in developing countries. Alex talks about minimum wage. Well, it's by law in India, by law, the minimum wage per month is $65. In Bangladesh, $95, in Pakistan, around $100. Now, those are things that can be changed by the governments adopting international law frameworks, bringing governmental and systematic reforms. In the 19th century, it was common in this country, ladies and gentlemen, for children of working-class family to work. But they had changed with government bringing minimum wage requirements, compulsory education requirements, and strong enforcement mechanics. Now, before you make your decisions tonight, remember that from the friendly consumer service employees in India to the avocado farmer in Mexico, I'm sure you love avocado, and I'm sure a lot of the proposition members would do, in fact. This has given poor communities the power to come out of the sheikers of poverty. The proposition tonight, ladies and gentlemen, will use an activity. And the dots, soundbites, in fact, emotive language to influence your rationale and to make you feel guilty about your choices. But behold and ask yourselves this. Have you seen supermarket using eco-friendly labels? Our restaurants and cafes using paper stores. Have you thought about taking your own grocery bag to the supermarket? Do we support corporations that uphold human rights values? Do you prefer renewable energy or fossil fuel? And will you choose a product that is fair trade-rable? If the answer to any of this is yes, then you are an ethical consumer. Can you improve your choices? Yes, you can. Because capitalism allows you the choice, the alternatives to choose another thing. For those reasons, I urge you to oppose this motion. Thank you. Thank you.
