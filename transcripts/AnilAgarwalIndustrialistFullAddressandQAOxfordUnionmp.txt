 Shall I go here? Thank you. very much just looking and we've been very nice Bashi Bhutani and to have her here and we have also Israra who came with me it was absolutely pleasure to be in Oxford areas I have experience of two experience of coming to Oxford one was when I was I was a little nervous person so I got a job when I was 25 26 and came to London hardly speak any English so my my employer asked him to take out his jaguar car and bring it to Oxford Street and I said yes I will do it I took took the car out and keep driving and looking for Oxford sign I find that I've come to the highway and I keep following I thought I made some mistake so at that time cell phone was not there so I stopped and made the telephone booth and call and ask him and he says I I told you Oxford Street not to go to Oxford. So that was my first experience of Oxford. The second experience I had, which is when I was very ambitious all the time, if I see something, my eyes will glitter and I want to achieve. Anything I see, I always want to purchase, achieve those things. So I wanted to build a company like that. to build a company like B.HP. And that was my whole dream. I went to B.H.B. Chairman, Brian Gilbertson, and I says, I have a good business in India, 1.4 billion people in India. Would you like to be my CEO, whatever you want, I want to be with me, introduce me in London, and I can raise my money. And he'll look at me. who you are who you are and I says look I'm serious I'll do everything for you but please accept it I don't know how he by the way he said I'm going tomorrow cycling Oxford will you come with me I'm I know I never exercise in my life and hardly did the cycling and I have I took the bicycle and I said I'm going. And I cycle that day 60 mile. I did it. I did it. And that was my great experience of Oxford. So it's very interesting, very, very interesting. I remember he throws the airport. Just coming out, I told my wife in India, we need to go. go to London, people are not recognized me here. I have a very good business. I want to raise money. I want to list my company. It is a great future of this company. And she says, you've gone mad. You have very well placed. We come from the village. We come to Bombay. We are a very good position. Why you want to go? But finally, she always been supportive of me. So we came to London. I still remember coming out of the Heathrow Airport with two children, me and my wife, didn't know anybody around here. Checking into the hotel, Hilton Hotel took the two room, one for children, one for myself, and look at the service office. And I wanted service office which looked like my office. So all other service people should look like my office and took the office and started working. What an amazing journey. I acquired. small mine, I work for somebody, I acquire a small company. I did everything is possible. It was an amazing, amazing journey. So this is what I am. Today, I come from this small village of Bihar, which is probably poorest state in India. And my mother, I'm really grateful to her. I always say one thing is very important that have a blessing. We come from that background. Blessing of the parents are very important. My mother is to get four pounds a month and four children. And the love and affection, what she has given me, that four pounds, raise us. It is incomparable. So very, very, very pleased that she raised us. And then I remember how I came to Bombay when I was just 19, didn't speak a word of English, just yes and no. And with one bedding, one steel box, and a tiffin came to Bombay and start my journey there for 15 years and enjoy every moment of it. So I came to London, listed my company. It was the largest listing of UK, London Stock Exchange. I looked at Canada, I looked at New York, but the way UK government and London stock exchange pitch, I was convinced that this is a place. I had, you name the people, the elite people who was on my board. Sir David Gourbuth, the French people, the politician, the businessman, and we could Tidambram from Finance Minister of India, who was the Finance Minister of India. Nareh Chandra, who was the ambassador of the U.S., all where on the board. And we have raised $2 billion listing value for the company. And we acquired company in India, we acquired company in Africa, we acquire a company in Africa, We acquired a company in Australia, and it was one after other. It was not easy. So I can keep on talking about my story. I'm very pleased that I'm here in the Harvard, which is a place where they're given the leaders. We have come to Oxford, where they've given the, all the leader today world is. all about the leader and the kind of leader Oxford has given, whether it is in India, whether it is in UK, whether it is in Pakistan, US, any Australia, anywhere you talk about, is a leadership what has changed and this is what I compliment and I always had a dream to come to study in Oxford but couldn't come for a study but I have come to visit and that's my achievement here today and very accomplishment I feel today so they've given the scientists they've given the best of sports people you name the people they're here so very pleased that I'm I'm among you people and for me is nothing will be more important the world has completely changed this is the time of economics this is the time where things are changing so rapidly where everybody wants that world to be a better place. When we leave this planet, we have to leave something behind for the future generation. And this is the time where people like you, the young people like you of Oxford to show the way, show the path where leader goes, thing goes. How we can balance ourselves, where we can develop economically, at the same time, they are very focused that we follow the environment. We follow very important, the human to have the relationship. World is one. That is very, very important. The world is one. We have in India, we say, which means the world is one. We all are together. So it is very important today's time. today the kind of digital development anything you talk about is happening which you people are doing innovation which is happening definitely I have no doubt that we can make this earth as a peaceful place where we all can live in harmony and this all require a leader when leader means lead and when the leader lead and when the leader lead people follow so I'm very pleased that I'm here as far as my business is concerned I'm very focused I'm I'll drink some water I started I started as a scrap merchant and always thought I should produce aluminum copper because India 1.4 billion people India has If you look at India is a part of South Africa and the Australia. When the volcano erupt, it parted it has the same soil what you have in Africa, what you have in Australia. So we have all the mineral which is available, which is required. You will not believe today's 73% of our revenue in India. in India with the 1.4 billion people which goes into the import of oil and gas, copper, zinc, aluminium, anything below the ground. Above the ground, we are self-sufficient. We have used to import above the ground. And I have no doubt we can double our production above the ground. And which will today's important need for other countries so we can export. Our government is a very pro-economic development, the way reform and opportunity is coming to India, especially to the women and very focused to develop the children. I have no doubt. I always have a vision that why India is not part of G7, why our India does not have a seat in the UN. as a permanent seat and why my rupee is not convertible. It is something very, very important. India subcontinent, if you look at, we are very humble people. We are very humble people. We never attack in our, if you look at the history anywhere. We always remain peaceful and it is a time where recognition has happened. Most of the leader, they prefer that in the world. that Indian should be a leader. Most of the technology company, I have no doubt we can create a Silicon Valley in India where get a lot of opportunity. Tourism is another very, very important area where everybody wants to go 10,000 year history, where we can go, we are arts, crafts, everything is there. So for me is very important that technology side, we have import, we are in a business of natural. resource. We are in a business of technology. We produce home to the fiber. Fiber is very, very important to connect. We are in a largest, one of the largest software company, system integration. We supply the complete backup to the operator for telecom company, them to operate. We are looking. Glass is very important factor, technology, because everything, whether you talk about cell phone, whether you talk about laptop, TV, anything you talk about is all about the glass. And India import $17 billion of glass. So it has all the ingredient and we should have that. Semiconductor, this is a crisis of semiconductor. There is a famine for the semiconductor. We have all the raw material. We produce the largest engineers. We produce the largest doctors. So semiconductor production is very important. And we have tie up with the Foxcon, which is a $200 billion company. We have our own company, Japanese company, where we produce glass. So very excited, very, very excited. Vedanta is going to be, we started my 25 years back. My total revenue was $1 million. And I'm very pleased today my revenue is $30 billion. And I have 100,000 people, hardly any union. Everybody feels that this is their company. And most important thing is, I have 33% women professional working for us. And I'm really encouraged the way women will make this world better. I think it will be unparalleled. So please encourage more and more women. They need some time to think. They are not like men immediately jump into the... jump into the anything they need a space they are different and I have I have experienced that if you work with them if you if you give them shoulder to shoulder the idea which they have they think different they will be ahead of everybody to take the world at a different place I can keep talking keep talking saying I can say but I'd love to hear from you and if there is any question I can answer. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you so much, Mr. Agarwal, for your remarks. It's been really nice to hear your journey a little bit in your own words. So if we take it all the way back, like you said, you were born in Bihar, in Patna, actually. And of course, you were exposed to business from a really young age because your father had his own aluminum conductor business. What do you think that taught you about business from a young age? Say again, what you? What do you think that taught you about business from a young age, seeing your father's business? I was not very good at a study and I always wanted to be in business. And whenever I see the newspaper, I don't understand English, but I will open the English CNN and the Bloomberg and see what they're talking, business business it was it was boiling in my my my blood so I started working earlier my father used to take me backside of his scooter very young is though it was not legal at that time at 14 years age I started driving the scooter and make him sit in the back so I always had that drive always always has that drive so now going to the business working with the business, you know, getting extra work of the business, expanding the business was always my, I still get excited. Yeah, absolutely. And you started by, you know, trading scrap metals as your very first business. What made you want to go into working in the sort of metal industry? Was it inspiration from your father? Was this something that you saw as very profitable at that time or what got you into metals in the first place? I have no idea. I was 19 years old when I landed into Bombay because I got the opportunity somebody told me if you can come and I stay in the Kalva Devi at Cotton Exchange at 21 rupees bed I put my bag steel box inside and he was the scrap merchant used to collect scrap from the cable company and used to sell So it was very exciting but I never seen until the age of 19 the tall buildings except in the movie except in the movie or the film star and the the glitter and such a beautiful woman so I never seen in my Bihar so I got very excited being in being in Bombay and the biggest drawback was I didn't know English and but you will not believe with yes and no I will get my work done. I'll get my work done. Half of the time people will not know that I don't know English. So I work around, I see how the nightlife, everybody's street. So you keep progressing and then you find this to own a cable company and there was an auction of a cable company and I could, got the opportunity to have this acquired this cable company without money. I can see one thing for the young people is very important. Their ambition, their determination is, and perseverance is more important than the money in the pocket. You know, at today's time you see the money people, they have a lot of money. They have a deep pocket but short hand. So their hand does not reach to the money. Yeah. So after you were in Bombay, you realized that instead of trading metals, you've been you can actually go down the manufacturing route. And so that's what you ended up expanding your business into. When you were starting out at this young age, were there any key people that were advising you on your business or did you have some big business inspirations that you looked up to at that time? Yes, at that time, all the business people in India, I didn't know anything, people outside India, but in our time we had the Bidlars, we had the Tatar, We have R.P. Goinkas. Those people were there and I used to see how they are acquiring company, how they are running the company. And I'll go, which hotel they go, which restaurant they go. I used to just go behind the pillar and watch them how they're eating, how they're putting their hand on the table, what they address and address, how they do it. So just to copy, I always say, first thing if you want to succeed in life, just copy. And then go from there. Yeah, fair enough. Of course, you weren't ever formally educated in terms of going to university or higher education. How do you think that impacted you when you were initially starting out your business? You said, of course, that English was a difficult skill for you. But do you think that not being formally educated made it more difficult for you to start off in the initial days? Or do you think that in business, it doesn't really matter whether you're formally educated or not? Yeah, I had just recently met Bill Gates. We spent time and it was very interesting topic and he said the same that I was not very keen on the higher study and we both started the business same time. 75 he started the same time and it is depend. I've seen the most successful people who are most educated. I've seen the people who are not educated with a wise they have a, the people who are the They have their DNA. I believe that fundamentally whatever you learn till the age of six that remains, that is the fundamental education. You know, your sanskhar, we call it sandskhar, which live with you for your whole life. So both work, I have seen the most of the people, a lot of people who are not educated, been very successful, I've seen the people who are very well educated, and I really respect them. Yeah, definitely. On the topic of Sonskhar and kind of values that you hold, I've heard that you're sort of a big member of ISCON and that your religion and spirituality are very important to you. How have those been guiding principles in your life and how have you stayed connected to the spiritual side despite, you know, all of the busy life that you hold? Yeah, one of the person who inspired me, not because of the spirituality, a person of 70 years old, has gone to US. And I'm not saying that he has done a wrong thing or right thing. 70 years old person, Sheila Prabhupad, he went from Summati Murarji's cargo ship, went to New York. and he landed there with some books of spiritual book of Bhagavad Gita with 40 rupees in his pocket. And he has the conviction that the people should be vegetarian, people should not speak life, people should not indulge into the smoking or to behave well, to remain as a peaceful. And he has gone with that mission. And I never seen anybody else more entrepreneur. than him that within 10 years time one million people of American they shave their head including the women the women doesn't have to shave head so shave the head and they give up the eating meat and they follow the path of peace to be non-violence and they started you have to hold some handle, I always believe that when I used to be in Patna, I used to go in a bus and used to hold the handle because there was never got a chance to sit on the seat because they were always crowded. So what you do, you always hold the handle and that handle save you. So you have to hold some handle. Some people hold the handle of their parents, that they are everything, some hold the handle of their guru, some people handle the handle of Krishna or Khudhazha. or Jesus, everything is fine, but you have to, because that gives you hope, that gives you, that gives you a lot of strength, that somebody is there, somebody is with me, or my friend is with me, you have to hold somebody and that's what, for me, I was in very difficult time, I was going through the depression, had no money, nobody trying to, was there to understand me. I have a lot of ideas whole night and I go and talk in the morning and everybody says rubbish. And today's I go with a rubbish idea and everybody says, wow. So you have to be careful when people praise you. So I find that Krishna was one feat which I could hold because I read the Bhagavad Gita and I found. that is a meaningful that how important that on your Dharma you stood and then you say no matter what happened I'm not going to be attached because everybody is going to leave this planet and after that where you go who knows but here whatever your Dharma whatever I always take three three things one is very important is my dedication towards the Krishna my dedication towards my profession, and my dedication towards my responsibility of my family, because they are trusty for our family. And then whoever is the Almighty, he's watching, how you handle your family, some people run away. You cannot run away because you are trusty of them, but at the same time you cannot be attached to them. Yeah, I mean, that's really, really wise words from you. If we jump back on your career and how you eventually then were manufacturing metals and things like that, in 2001 the government announced its disinvestment program, which I'd say definitely helped you expand your business. Would you say this was pivotal in sort of the way that Vedanta came to be? And how would you define your relationship with the government at this time and how is that fluctuated as you've been? expanded for Danta? For me, I'm not here. Whatever is the government, like your wife, like your parents, government is also same. You have to take it the same pedestal. You have to change according to what government is. You know, the government is not going to change what you want. So we are business people and we have very sub-sabbyive way. We had the government of Congress, we had a government of BJP, Atalbihari, Bajpei. We have a government, today very reformist Mr. Modi. So whichever government has come, everybody, there is no other two-way except moving forward. Two things they have to make sure that happen. What I understand, two or three things. Number one, below the ground, we have a phenomenal wealth and we need to explore. All India has to go full focus and I'm looking all the unicorn, all the startup. Today is a time of a startup. Today I'm like looking millions of startup to come up and they can come up. Today the funding is available. People are looking to fund them to explore, explore. explore and explore and the time has changed whereby through technology which artificial intelligence the geophysics you don't have to dig out mother earth and our body are by the same same similar so there was a time where you have to dig out the whole land but today's a time with the technology you make your environmental better it's like olden time when used to do heart cells It used to be bloodbath. Today you can be microscopic, you can see the computer and you can repair it. Same thing with the Mother Earth you can do. And exploration is very, very important for our survival. A very important government has no business to be in a business. That's what my Prime Minister has said. And I have no doubt we have probably $200 billion market cap of our public sector. public sector, government company, it can increase by five times. Production can increase. We cannot afford to retrench our people, but it has to come out with the government hand, and it has to work with the, make them corporation. What happened? This is another America. India is a land of opportunity, is a land of entrepreneur. So for me, this government looks great because they are very much on to start They want bringing the equality and they are looking forward more and more younger people to be successful and entrepreneur. So I have no doubt two-third of majority and I think Mr. Modi is a tall leader today. I don't see anybody else in the world with the 1.4 billion people. He is the tallest leader, he is a stable leader and I have no doubt he has no vested interest. wasted interest except to take forward this country. Yeah, great. You touched briefly on actually what my next point was going to be, which is kind of looking at the environment. So Vedanta in its present form is a global natural resources conglomerate. And whilst you've made a lot of profit off of Vedanta, I guess some of the concerns that people might have is about what you think about the environmental impact of your company. Is it something? that you've tried to look after and what kind of sustainability efforts have you made in this area? This is the biggest thing on my heart to make the our world better. And for that, what is the kind of things? We are the ahead of everybody as far as renewable energy is concerned. We are ahead of our US. If you look at, we are so conscious because in our Shastra, it has been Britain 5,000 years back, that we have to keep our environment clean and green. And with today's strong movement for us, ESG, environment, our community, our community, our community our safety is the highest priority whether it is a clean water to make sure our rivers are clean not polluted our whatever discharge we have the technology has come whereby we can be continuously keep producing with the better environment with the sustainability and it's not a one-day journey it is it is on journey it is an ongoing journey and consciousness is very important and anybody comes in we take a pledge that you will be the part of sustainability and please do not shy away pointing out what better we can do to produce today withanta we are very proud 25% what we produce is is green metal green oil and very proud that we are making progress into it and we will be ahead of everybody and that's what we are looking for and India has taken a position where they will be we have declared mr. Modi has signed the pact 2050 will be neutral on the sustainability so I have no doubt and we'll be ahead of everybody as far as the environment is concerned. And especially our women are really helping us. People ignore small, small things. But I have seen the small small things, a consciousness help. And then if you see what we are doing of today's everybody talk about mini, what is that mini? Mini lipstick. What a beautiful. I have seen, I read, I'm following, a follower of Gandhi. You know, Gandhi at that time, if he is writing half page and half page is blank, he will turn that half page and keep it on the side. I saved that. When he will wear the clothes what he need. When he came to meet long leave our queen to meet her, to meet her, she says, because he was having one clothes which I was wearing and says, that's all you have. And he says, Madam, the rest of the clothes you are wearing for us. So we have, I'm very pleased that the whole thing is turning where what our father, you know, our, Gandhi, Mohanlal Karamchan Gandhi, he has taught us that time he used to laugh. He will only eat in his small bowl, not to waste him. And he will eat like with the passion, with the love. Because very important that what he taught us is that the body is not everything. Body, mind and soul. Soul is very important. When he is to meet everybody, he is to meet everybody, he is to meet. like he's his own you know that that's that's our soul our mind mind will take you anywhere but make sure we remain positive mind we remain he he's the only one who taught to the world with with the non-violence you can win it so I have no doubt the on your ESG what we all the modern terms the vegan I I have always said that vegan is such an important factor and the world has recognized. And earlier I remember when we used to go to America and Western world, I used to be ashamed saying that I'm a vegetarian, because people will not understand they will make uncomfortable. Now when I say I'm a vegan, they look up to me. They look up to me. So I'm very pleased things are coming in our favor. Yeah, I mean, I'm also vegan. And I hope that that's how people look up to me too. I can see your smile and I can believe it. So like you said, environmental efforts are a step-by-step process, right? Things don't happen overnight and it's something that you have to work on over a long period of time. I'd say, of course you've made a lot of strides, but there have also been some challenges that you've faced. So for instance, Vedanto was accused of dumping a bunch of arsenic bearing slag near Tamil Nadu, or in 2018, when you tried to set up a second smelting complex off of this. There were a lot of protests that led to a few casualties as well. How do you think this impacted Vedanta as a whole? And sort of did you approach environmentalism and sustainability different after these events? And how do you think Vedanta can recover its reputation from an environmental standpoint after these incidents? So when you have determined to grow big or to do something impact on this world, the headwind comes. Nobody wants you to grow. You know, when we used to go third class of a compartment in railway, people will not allow us to enter. No, no, there is no place, there is no place. But you have to push and go inside. You know, nobody, world does not want India to produce these metal. They want India to be a market. And this is, we knew that this is coming in when we start producing copper, we start producing iron ore. This kind of challenges will come. But I can tell you one thing. I'm very conscious. We put up the world-class copper plant. We built world-class aluminum plant. We built everything world-class. knew that because I am doing first time and nobody believed that this can be produced in India, somebody can be so courageous to start something like this. And you have to be fully aware and go with that and never stop your journey. So we keep moving. Today the whole world knows we are in the Dojohn sustainability. We are number one in India. very pleased, 25% renewable energy is coming. We have no union by and large, 100,000 people. This can only happen when they believe that we are transparent. And we have a very nice song in Hindi. Kuch to people can say. People's work is, saying. Let's do bekaar key things. So this is very important. people has to say something and they will say. But one thing I can tell you, the new industry which is coming up is all world-class. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and your world-class, I would say. And I encourage all our youngster, our unicorn, to be conscious that without producing metal, without producing basic you cannot EV you talk about renewable anything you talk about only need metal and it required five times more metal it is not going to fall from the sky you have to produce Mother Earth has given you everything you have to do it in most sustainable manner to produce this to develop your nation to develop the kind. Yeah. You mentioned just now that you have memories of when you were a child sitting in the back of the train. Of course you grew up in Bihar, which is not a very wealthy part of India. And now if you flash forward your life to present day, you're worth tens of billions. Would you define your story as a rags to richer story? You know, Ritu is here, she does all CSR communication because Vedanta is going to be an institution which will remember for 500 years or more. It is not going to run by my family. It is going to run by the best people who take forward this company. Most of my wealth has given for the women and children. I'm looking forward 80 million children around five years. They should be the best, fearless is very important. They should have a sanskar, education, nutrition, meal. I'm looking forward to everything to work through the technology. I will never do anything which does not involve the technology. So my most of wealth has gone. Why I have been called billionaire, I don't understand. But if they want to say, they can say. But on the real terms, I'm not a billionaire. But definitely it is a story, which as you've said, whether you call it to rich, whatever, it is a story which. But I think I'm just the beginning. I'm looking forward, a lot of, I have a lot of energy left and I'm looking forward how can I be helpful to the people. How can I change this world? How can I help this world? How can we make my country, India, to be a progressive nation, eradicate poverty, create job? So that is also one of the things comes to my mind. So this is definitely a story which I encourage all my youngster that making money is not a sin. This is the wealth creation and please always remain conscious that you are a trustee of your wealth. Only thing which you can keep with you what you need. When I met Dalai Lama, I am a fan, my guru is Dalai Lama and I really spent time with him in the Dharamshala. shahla and I remember three things which he told me one was when I was asking him I have to learn something from you I have to take something from from you and one three things I remember three or four things I went with my friend of mine Rishi Satya so and one thing he told me first that your body is your temple as you worship in the temple keep it clean nice because treat your body as a temple Number two, he says, very important that your profession. Whatever profession you are, doesn't matter if you are a sweeper, do it with the passion. When you put your heart and soul into it, it gives you ten times more pleasure. Ten times the passion is very important whether you are sweeper. So if I am working in industry, make sure that you put your whole heart and soul into it. And number three, which was very hard for me, but I'm trying to follow as much as possible. He told me anything you keep beyond your need. You're a thief. So this is what I'm saying. Making money, please make money, but remain trusty. Remain trusty that you are a custodian of your wealth and it should be used for the society. Yeah. You said that youth and children and giving back to youth is very important to you in both a philanthropy sense but also in a general sense of inspiring youth to go into entrepreneurship and business. What message would you have for youth today for young people who are looking to go into business? or now that you're very well established, what advice would you give to a young Anil who is just in Bombay starting out? Beautiful. I really wanted to give. I'm very simple, and I know that there are more intelligent people who can give the advice, but I can say what I practice. So for me, it's very important that please join the because entrepreneur is only can be 5%. 95% of the people I encourage them to join the entrepreneur because they live in that environment. I'm not saying don't join multinational, they're also good but they're very structured. It can take long time for them to what they want to be but to join the entrepreneur and for the entrepreneur is very, very important number one please get away from your laziness laziness laziness get away from your laziness number two remain fearless fearless will take you where you want to go and number three what will protect you in a difficult time your humbleness so these things I by I talk about to the entrepreneur and And that's what I practice myself. Today is a time where half of the wealth is in the equity. There's so much of money around and they want to invest and reinvest. Please make sure that you choose a business which is equity-oriented. Because salary is one which is important. But, you know, if you, I always believe, and always tell my people that my people that my vision is my people who work for me for they must own a house they must get the children educated also in India marriage is also big thing and get the children marriage for them for these three things they should not spend their salary they should come through the equity and they should they should go to a company work with the company which is equity oriented and I have no doubt the kind of valuation you get with the technology company, ESG company, multiple can be anything. And these companies have a stock option, they are a partner in this company, and that helps. So this is my message to entrepreneur. There is no substitute for the hard work. What the body is going to do? Work. You know, don't be lazy. remain focused, you do the passion what you have 100% and remain fearless. Have the humbleness because that will protect you. And always dream big. It's not that I have only contract to be dream big. You also have a con. You can also dream big. It's all your state of mind. It does not mean that the people who does not. not want that's fine but somebody want to dream big why not you know and it's it can be like in your Oxford when I see all the leader you have given politician scientist business is very very important and there is no doubt business is very very important economic development is very important and you unless you are risk-taker take risk, taking a calculated risk will take you forward, but never flout the law of the land. It's very important. Yeah, good advice. Final thing I guess I wanted to ask is, you know, you've lived an illustrious career. Vatanta globally has been well established. I guess what would you want the one biggest part of your legacy to be? What do you think you'd want people to take away from you, your career, your story, your life, everything? I really don't think I'm pretty comfortable if nobody knows me. I've come, I've gone, I've done what I have to do. and I always believe what is in my hand I'm going to do the best. What is not in my hand? Why should I worry about? Somebody says there is a God. Somebody says there's no God. Leave it there because something is in mine, not mine hand. What legacy I want to leave? I don't know. But I really am not very good to. personalize glorifying myself. Today is also when I got this invitation for me was there that to place where you visit in India when you go to particular mosque or a temple or you go to that river you believe that your mission is complete and you have you have that soil of that place make you difference. So that's how I came to Oxford also. So this This is hopefully I was born. I can't change my parents, no matter what happened. I can't change my brother. I can't change my roots. I come from India. And whatever I can do for my India, and I'm looking at my India where a prosperity, what they have spread about the yoga, meditation, is a walk of the life everybody talk about. And that's what I'm looking at, how from my country, bureaucracy, which is everybody talk about in the world. And I'm looking forward where the government machinery must mobilize or go away what I see in the Western world. So decision can be faster. The development can be faster. These are the things that come to my mind. And very important that everybody get a job. Women must get empowered. must get empowered, very, very important. So these are the things which I'm working on. Going forward, I'm going to focus more and more on 80 million children. And if I can bring through the technology, I'm looking forward how much food I can cook. But if I can develop some kind of bar or some kind of innovation, a capsule, which is a tree, which you plant. So my children, literally I'm going to adopt them so they are not malnutrition. They are fearless. That will be my biggest achievement. Women, we have a most intelligent woman in India. How they get exploited? 16, 17, they get married. They have three children. You know, they're intelligent. How can, why we have been asking this question to my software people, Why we have to create such a bricks and motor building? Why can't this women who are educated in their home itself they develop the what you call it website or software can be electronically transfer to develop the system? So they get job. You know, they have a local talent. How can they develop that product? And the whole world is looking forward to some people. looking forward to support. Somebody has to lead. So this is what I'm looking for. I'm very excited. I'm excited about my business. I'm also equally excited about, about, I'm not a government. I can't change the government, but definitely I can take certain mission, which is a women, children, creating a university like this, maybe a different university, which is a digital university. I'm very, I'm designing, I'm a design company master, God-gifted designing, Designing is in my, I can design anything, visualize, dream and put into the paper. I can't do the detail where I need a lot of help from the expert and the professional, but the fundamental design I can do. So this is what I'm going to do, hopefully. Yeah, hopefully. Thank you so much, Chairman. This has been really, really insightful to hear from you personally. Can I invite the audience in thanking Mr. Anelagrawell for his time this evening.
