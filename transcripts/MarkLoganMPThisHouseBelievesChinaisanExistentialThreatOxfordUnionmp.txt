 Today I object I object I just a English That is Nairier-Ferlachi Just for to come to this Herein' debate So translation a very kind offer this evening to meet with and be interviewed by Nigel Farage and instead I'm here at the Oxford Union. And so I'm not sure which of these is riskier. To be on this side of the debate here of the Oxford Union or indeed to be in my constituency where Nigel Farage is meeting with a couple of hundred of my fellow Boltonians and so I hope he doesn't leave a trail of disaster after him that I have to try and read up tomorrow morning when I'm back on back in the patch. in all seriousness I do make a point on this is that how can we comment fully? How can we have a grasp on something that many people in the West struggle to understand whether culturally, whether politically or indeed linguistically speaking? Imagine in the latter half of the 20th century a group of people debating the United States of America as experts yet they had barely been to the leader of the free world nor could they converse in English. Yet oftentimes, this is where we have got to in the public debate on China in the UK. Only a handful of people in the Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office speak Mandarin to a native level of fluency, where many Chinese diplomats that I've came across in my current and previous career speak much better English than I do. But that wouldn't be hard when you have an accent like mine. but I have a point to make here also when it comes to fear and to influence and Johnny Depp had a I'm not going to talk about the court case but he had a movie Fear and Loving in Las Vegas I think he was in that movie and it's a bit of a freaky Diki production but what I believe we need to be vigilant against is fear and loving in London and in the West because as politicians as with many future leaders of public life and industry here tonight and that will eventually, this isn't live, is it? This is going to be put out in YouTube afterwards? So when it comes out on YouTube eventually, we obviously can strive for power, we can strive for influence, but what's more important is how we use both that power and that influence. Indeed, the single biggest question facing China last century was how to become wealthy, and how to become powerful. Now that it has both, the question has turned to how China will use both this power and this wealth. Everyone has their hobby horse. For some, it's climate change, for others, it's Brexit. I see that in my inbox day and day out. And I have in my constituency those who are raving about legislative frameworks around bees, honey, also because of the passing of European Union legislation, And it would appear those opposite us tonight also believe that the biggest question is that that centers around the rise of China. Perhaps we are tackling a question like, how should we deal with arising China? How do we defend democracy in the face of different systems of governance? That could be another question. The thing is, I think we're going to end in a very bad place if the starting point is China is a threat to our way of life. and therefore we have to do X, Y and Z. You see, the only thing we should fear is fear itself. And I'm sure you've heard that hundreds of times since you became members of the Oxford Union. Sorry for the cliche. We see fear about a platform where people dance in short videos and tell us how to make our first million. TikTok, and maybe that's just the algorithm that I have when I'm flicking through TikTok. Yet the question I ask myself is not how do we regulate such platforms, whether American or Chinese, but rather how do we come up with something bigger, better, more creative than the competition out there? Where is our British competitor to TikTok? That's where our focus should be, not on what others are doing, but on what we can do. Some people fear being monopolized by Made in China. Well then, let's continue to up our game. secure those supply chains that need to be secured and continue to make and design in Britain. My Honourable Member of the opposition earlier, we were talking of fear of what's happening to the United States. But again, I think too much of that focus is looking at what China is doing, and a lot of the time it's trying to play catch-up. We've seen this at the G7 conferences. China for over a decade or around a decade now has been working on, built-in-road initiative. The West responded to that with its own initiative. The gentleman who made an incredibly insightful and also somewhat humorous speech who sat in the third row just back there, but was also alluding to this also when talking about the rise of populism and the rise of authoritarianism. We do need to ask ourselves in the world, is China or is these authoritarian regimes becoming more like us, or is it the other way our rise? rounds. We also are asking tonight, is China a threat? Yet what I've observed in politics these number of years is that parts of the West has lost confidence. That's a threat. The belief in our way of life in our tried and tested liberal values and the economic system our form of capitalism that has done more for humans' material progress than any other economic model in history. And that fear as my right honourable former classmate at the China Centre in the University of Oxford was referring to in the Confucius Institutes and obviously there are there are instances what we've seen academic publications whether in the United States, the UK of potential and influence by some of these organisations but the reality is I mean my Chinese is pretty decent and I didn't go to Confucius Institute and actually very few people do actually go through Confucius institutes and in this country. When I was working at the British consulate in Shanghai in 2012, the British Council was so successful at that time 10 years ago that it had to be siphoned off the exams and language part of the operation from the British Council because it was bringing in more revenue than nearly any other company in my constituency bar, Warburton's Bread, Becker's, the only one. So we have huge amounts of soft power influence. That's something that I do not want us to to lose across the world, including in China, because if you ask the average Chinese person, what's your favorite country in the world? The UK still comes up top three. Germany is usually number one because of banshe, banshe, banshe, bian, chien, and, that, what, what, what, gau shenfu, something, something, gau tchuanth, in Shanghai, Pudong, to the Shurongch, if you can translate Maglev, you're doing well. So, so. Ah, just chishun Fu, ah, yeah, so, um, so. So, um, um, We really need to have confidence of what we offer, because as some of our friends rightly pointed out, people are coming to the UK and the West in their droves. That's why we have 150,000 roughly Chinese students at all levels throughout our education system. And long may that continue, because when these students return to their respective countries, whenever we've done programs like the Chevening Scholarship Program for government officials, that does have influence. We shouldn't, as my Honourable Friend and the opposition, refer to, say that we have no chance of influencing, that we have no chance of shaping. I absolutely believe that we do, but to have that influence, we have to be in the room with China. Because if we don't, it will just ignore us. It will just ignore us. Because in the United Kingdom, we do have to ask to China, what are the ten most important countries in the world? And is the United Kingdom featuring in that top ten, or is it countries that are on their periphery that are in the Asia-Pacific region? We must maintain that influence. We must be in the room with China. Well, I think this is more of a debate about life in the UK today and of tomorrow. What reforms do we need to take politically, economically and socially to ensure that Brits not only secure basic needs, but to fulfill our dreams well into the future. We need, therefore, to fend off making disastrous decisions that ultimately threaten our way of life because I see the massive threats as destabilising 1,400 million people, one of the economic regimes of the global economy, the threat of regional and domestic conflicts. We want to protect the rules-based system, but if we push for more conflict, we could rupture the entirety of the system because this is not North Korea that we're dealing with when it comes to bilateral or multilateral relations with China. And the threat of making many of those from East and Southeast Asian backgrounds, as some of my honourable friends refer to earlier on, in this country and from those backgrounds, feel unwelcomed in our society. So I think when we were going to this idea of our way of life, what is that? Well, we look at the Chinese diaspora in the United Kingdom. And the Chinese diaspora, according to our own government statistics, along with Indian, Hindu, British ethnic groups here are some of the highest achieving within the United Kingdom. We see this at primary school level, we see this at secondary school level, university level, per capita income. And to say that China is a threat to our way of life, I think it's absolutely the other way around. I think if you ask many of the universities across the United Kingdom, what's the inputs and what's the contribution that Chinese students make to their campuses? Obviously, many of the students, as you'll know, sitting here, you have to pay higher fees. Thank you very much. That meant I had to pay lower fees. Thank you. Thank you, Thank you, thank you so much. But there is a real cultural contribution that come from those Chinese students being based here in the same way that whenever I was studying Mandarin overseas in Shanghai and Beijing, as I learned a lot and I felt that that was able to kind of shape my understanding of that region, a region that I knew very little about in the past. Also, the characterization of Chinese people that I read is often skewed, sensationalised, and it's always about the China stories that are big or weird or quirky in some way. If you want to find out more, actually, about modern Chinese society, this is a plug for Cindy on her podcast. Her podcast is Chinese Whispers, she's still called Chinese Whispers, fantastic podcast, one of the very few people doing such things in the United Kingdom. But also, I believe that in actual facts, Chinese people share very, very similar values and aspirations of that. of our own people. They believe in prosperity. They believe this is going to be a very conservative thing. I know Cindy has pointed this out to me before, but they believe that in the idea, a lot of the times of personal responsibility, it's not what the government can do for me. It's the irony of their system sometimes is that yes, it's very status. Go on ahead. Go for it. There's a clear distinction between the priorities of the Chinese people and that of the Chinese government as is referred to by China in this motion. Well, I think that of course there's their nuances. But the thing that we have to remember is that through progress, through economic development, through the exchanges that we'll hopefully have now that the lockdowns have ended, that we will see an increasing amount of influence and hopefully more convergence because the last few years we've seen too much divergence economically and culturally also. But just getting back to my final few points before I'm wrapping up is that Chinese parents also want the best for their children the same as we do. They believe in commercial development And also the UK and China are proud nations with deep philosophical underpinnings, with wider influence, sometimes negative, sometimes positive when looking to the past. Coming to the ends, this side, I believe tonight is, unfortunately I'm out of time. This side tonight obviously starts on the back foot because it's been a very contentious and heated debate over the last three years in the United Kingdom and the West. And obviously I'm incredibly sad to hear some of the experience that Mr. Uar, Kailash, has referred to, not just tonight, but in times past. Though I believe we see the threat to humanity as the fear in our own ability, it's the stabilising 1.4 billion people, and also the fear of not living up to our own liberal democratic values. Because like capitalism, I believe that this can be and should be a battle of ideas. It doesn't mean a battle, it's a bloody battle, but it should be a battle based on who makes the strongest argument, who makes the convincing argument. And I think we need to re-energize our own liberal democracies to show that we can increasingly provide for people, both whether it's materially, socially, and in terms of their happiness as well. And I think that's the true definition of classic liberalism. And just to end on, the idea of crisis, obviously, and this is the old chestnut, and everyone will be sick of hearing this, but in Chinese, the word for crisis is Wei Ji, and it's made up of two Chinese characters. Wei is threat. G is opportunity. These two characters, when they come together, they mean crisis. And I believe, looking at these free future, I believe politicians this evening, we have here an opportunity in crisis, a future Republican senator. By the way, by the way, right of applause, right of applause, right of applause. Right of applause. How old are you? So he's only, he's only two. 22, so I'm hopefully going to be retired by the time I have to come up against this good gentleman. Don't worry, you lost one election. In my first general election, I got 900, and someone's going to have to Wikipedia this for me, I think it was 954 votes. And the winner in that particular general election at constituency got 27,000 votes or whatever. So you can do it, just, you'll just believe in yourself. And earlier on, I was sat behind, beside the wonderful Miss Duckworth. And I did ask her, because I got this feeling from her, that she had political ambition. And she said, I mean, I'm too young for that. And her parents look very worried. Sat was sat behind her. I'll give you good career advice. Don't become a politician. Go into finance or tech or something like that. But do you believe that you see a future politician sat in our midst? No. Yes. Yes. Round of applause for Ms. Duckworth. Round of applause for Ms. Dunford. Well done. Well done. So this side, this side believes we have an opportunity. to further the interests of our way of life, both at home and abroad, by being at the table and in the room with China. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
