 Mr. President, it was said of one of your most titanic predecessors as president of the Oxford Union, a man who sought to reinvent British politics and turned it into a morality play with himself, starring himself as God, right-hand man. I refer, of course, to William Gladstone looking not terribly impressed, gazing between Edward Heath and his Asquith, isn't it? Looking straight at me. Asquitt, Gladstone, yes, by general consent, the greatest chancellor of the exchequer in our history, a man who regarded income tax as immoral and almost managed to abolish it. At the age of 22, so very shortly after leaving this union, at the age of 22, he became a member of the House of Commons, and at the age of 82, he formed his fourth and last administration. And it was said of him that he had not a single redeeming defect. That was said by his great rival Benjamin Disraeli. Disraeli, of course, quite different. Both of them. both of them. I mean I listened with enjoyment to Abby Bacon's speech but to think that these people were no more than interesting vessels as she put it or as Mr. Follett put it no more than propagandists is a ludicrous underestimate of what we owe to them because they they were men who were expressing the idea of the name they were among the great originators and practices of our whole parliamentary tradition. They had a rivalry which lasted for 30 years. They were completely different. Disraeli, this reputable young man, he was not, I mean, Gladson had had eaten and Price Church. Disraeli had none of that. And he was articled by his father to a firm of solicitor. He wanted to be a great man. He wanted the romance. and so he decided to invest in South American mining shares. And he wrote some pamphlets saying that these shares were a very good thing, and he borrowed huge amounts of money, and of course the shares were completely worthless. So from the age of most people in this chamber, he was encumbered with enormous debts for the rest of his life. But he nevertheless, there they were, Gadsden and Israeli, presenting people in this country, country with a choice which and telling telling people what politics was about. Curzon, Curzon's somewhere in here. Curzon's over there looking. Well, he's looking rather haughty, that white busts there. I'm afraid he always did. I'm afraid his contemporaries at Baylil, they got Curzon's measure and they made up what he called this accurseded doggerel which pursued him through his life. my name is George Nathaniel Curzon I am a very superior person my face is pink my hair is sleek I dine at Blenheim once a week so they didn't not everyone in Belial liked him and 43 years later he was president in 1880 in 1923 he didn't get it partly because he had this superior manner which was thought not fitting for an increasingly democratic period. I'll touch on one more rather obscure figure. I've tried to bring in before a wider public. One more rather obscure figure who was president of this union. He did it partly by pretending to be a social democrat. This was his second attempt, his first attempt having been a lamentable failure. And he became president in 1986 and only 30 years later in 2016, he became the most hated man in Oxford and indeed far beyond Oxford. And I would immediately like to say that any of you wish to go on hating Boris Johnson, please do so. My case does not depend on trying to persuade people to love Boris Johnson. You can go on hating him or admiring him. But the thing is, if the great man theory of history is wrong, then it's not worth hating him or indeed admiring him because he couldn't have had any real effect on the referendum. He couldn't have been a decisive figure and that is at the heart of the problem with this motion. It's a it if it it's a motion which really tells us never bother to vote in a general election never bother to vote for who's president of the union it doesn't matter whether it's Gladson or Israeli it doesn't matter whether it's thatcher or Callahan it doesn't matter whether it's Johnson or yes of course you say that it doesn't matter, yet surely these people are proponents of larger arguments, of larger movements, which do make a difference in history. So I think that this simplification just surely shouldn't stand in this chamber. I think the first two speakers have both said that these individuals are as individuals completely unimportant, and they're the creatures of economic forces and various other forms of sub-Marxist analysis. I mean, really, there was a very clear depreciation by the proposes this motion of the role of the great man in history. Let's look quickly at that great laboratory of democracy, the United States of America. And oddly enough, I did, a little while ago I wrote a volume of brief lives of all the American presidents who was born in on me that only a few of them, very few of them, were great men. Four of them were on. Four of them were on. Mount Rushmore, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt. Yes. I think you forgot Ronald Reagan. How do you know I forgot Ronald Reagan? Reagan is, to the four I've just mentioned who are on Rushmore, I would add Franklin D. Roosevelt. And there is indeed a collection of admirable patriotism on your part. He was a very successful president after a long period of miserable failure of various. kinds. Nixon and Carter, that terrible business trying to rescue the hostages. They all made a and Ford palpably not up to it. Vietnam, an utter catastrophe for the West as well as for America. And of course, a catastrophe for all the poor Vietnamese who were bombed to bits by the Americans. So Reagan did revive matters. And Reagan is part of a handful of considerable figures. There were, of five or six other considerable presidents, apart from the indisputably great ones. And then there are about 30 presidents who no one has ever heard of. And I'd be surprised, even in this learned assembly, if anyone, but a very small number of people here could name the eight presidents who came before Lincoln or the eight presidents afterwards. They were all miserable little hucksters. I mean, terrible, terrible lot. But this Hucksterism, and they were just selected by their party, so that they would win the election and then distribute the spoils to the party hacks. But in the midst of this lamentable 19th century history of America, we have Lincoln. And Lincoln, you must. You must admit that Lincoln was a great man. It came from nothing. Actually, I don't have any visual aids, but he could hold an axe out. he was so strong because as a young man it had to clear virgin forest so that his father could have a farm in the forest. Lincoln understood, there are some people who think that opposition to slavery is only a very recent thing and equality and liberty. Lincoln absolutely understood these things. He absolutely understood that it is all there in the Declaration of Independence by Jefferson in 1776, and 83 years later he at, Gettysburg burying the Union dead. He expressed it. I didn't want to stumble over his words. I've written them down. Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. And then he ended. We hear only two minutes later, a speech of brilliant concision. Not all of us can live up to that standard. We hear highly resolve that these dead shall not have lived in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom, and the government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. The absurd implication that people like Lincoln didn't matter is simply intolerable. I beg to oppose the motion. I'm
