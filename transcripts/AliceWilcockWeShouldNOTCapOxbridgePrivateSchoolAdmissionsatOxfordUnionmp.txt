 And I look to Alice Wilcock, Head of Education and Policy, at the Centre of Social Justice to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you, Mr President. It's a pleasure to be here tonight. Oxford and Cambridge have a vital role to play in addressing the admissions gap. But it is essential that we develop a system in which your beginnings do not drive your endings. While some progress has started to be made, it still seems like admissions to Oxford follow the same old story that they have done for hundreds of years. We've all read this book before. You grow up wealthy, you effectively have a magic key that grants you access to Oxford. This motion hopes to offer a reboot, the same old content dressed up in shining, and you shiny colours. Don't be deceived. While a CAP system may sound like a brand new story, and that's what the proposition want you to believe, it's purely fan fiction. Tonight, I'll hope to convince you that a cap-based system would put a focus on meeting arbitrary quotas and divert resources from proven policy solutions that tackle the root causes behind the admissions gap. If we want a fair admission system, we need to give disadvantaged pupils the chance to craft their own endings. This motion is obsessed with wordplay. It creates a world where people are summarized in their sound bites. It assumes privates can be directly translated into privilege, while all state school applicants must be disadvantaged. The reality is, if you want to understand someone's background, you have to read the whole novel, not just the blurb. A private education does not equate with privilege. A third of all Bersy students, Alksford and Cambridge, actually came from private schools. On the other side, not all states' school children are disadvantaged. Now I struggled with us myself. I'm preparing for tonight's debate. How could I not revisit my own narrative? How did I tell you guys my story? What do I want that story to look like? I've been billed tonight as a state school comprehensive pupil who went to Brazenous. Is that true? Yeah? Is that the whole picture? Definitely not. I would change nothing about my story. In fact, I feel very privileged. I'm convinced I had the best education money goodbye. Just turns out that the taxpayer was putting the bill. I got the grades I needed and I was lucky enough to go to an amazing sixth form college which had an amazing track record and getting pupils into Oxford and Cambridge. While the education that I received was incredible, I also had a secret weapon, my family. Now I've undonead about whether or not I should include them in the speech tonight, but I don't think I can tell you my story without reference to my parents. They literally moved heaven and earth to help me with my application. Honestly, if there was a Guinness World Record for the number of visits to the student room, it'd go to my mum. My mum and dad looked over countless personal statements. They helped me refine my critical thinking skills and shared every high and low on my journey. I was blessed to have a family who could devote so much time to supporting me. I owe them a debt of gratitude for my place at Braysnaus. So was I disadvantaged because I went to a state comprehensive school? you know I don't think so in fact compared to some friends I made here who went to private school I had a whole lot more support than they actually did the truth is there are some state school pupils who are advantage and there are private school pupils who aren't we cannot simply say that by boosting state school admissions figures Oxford will automatically reach pupils from the most disadvantaged backgrounds if we want to challenge the low number of disadvantaged pupils getting into Oxford I think we all do we need to understand what lies behind the admissions gap At the Centre for Social Justice, we have found three main barriers that disadvantaged people's face. The primary barrier is low prior attainment, which economists have actually shown accounts almost entirely for the different rates of admissions into university. Pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds are around half as likely to get their top exam results needed for a competitive Oxford application. The second is soft bigotry of low expectations. Many pupils worry that they wouldn't fit in, and this is enough to put them off applying in the first place. I mean, look at us. I'm dressed up in black tie for this debate tonight. That is ludicrous. But there's still loads of smart and ambitious disadvantaged pupils who fail to make the cut each year. And these children face a third barrier. They receive very little help with that application. A cap does nothing to tackle these injustices. It only creates a set of perverse incentives. It encourages colleges to inflate state school admission figures to get their tension-grabbing poll quote. But if you look in the fine print, you'll see that this new system would not lead to a radical rewrite. If a cap was introduced, it's likely that we would see an exodus of children from private schools into the very best state schools as they attempt to gain the new system. Alongside distorting the incentives of families, let's consider what a cap would do to the incentives of Oxford admissions officers. Colleges at Oxford, who currently admit very few state school children, would be faced with the challenge of boosting these numbers overnight. Their incentive structure would be focused solely on inflating state school admission figures. because there's nothing in this motion tonight which incentivises supporting the most disadvantaged learners. It's worse form, this cap would drain resources away from admissions programs which are making a real difference. Extensive outreach programs are expensive and time-consuming. They don't lead to an automatic influx of state school pupils overnight. In a bid to meet these targets, admissions officers may divert resources away from successful longer-term admissions programs which are tackling the root causes behind this admission gap. In the end, any system which promotes fair access through caps and quotas results in inclusion on paper but would sure thought of inclusion in practice. Those in favour of the cap, they concede that it wouldn't lay to the system change straight away. However, they'll hope to convince you that a good writer for the newspapers would be enough to change the legacy. Just imagine the headline. 93% of children at Oxford are now stay educated. Would this be enough to permit disadvantaged pupils who never saw themselves here to start writing themselves into the story. Would it matter if beneath the numbers, things were pretty much the same as before? I think glossy new headlines wouldn't undo the myths about access if, in reality, the demographics of Oxford remain largely unchanged. It really matters who is getting in and how they get here. Kids only start to see a path for themselves to Oxford and Cambridge when their own stories change. There's strong evidence for this. Studies have shown that raising aspirations only shift the dial if pupils get to the children. the grades and support to access higher education. So, if we want to rebalance admissions, we need a system that creates a bold new narrative for children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. My role is education going ahead at the Centre for Social Justice, and it's been a big priority for my team to try to unpick what this new system should look like. Our research has found that the biggest barrier in admissions for disadvantaged pupils is that they're less likely to have the grades needed to even apply in the first place. Now there's only so much any university can do to address the attainings. gap. Ultimately, the responsibility really does lie with government to tackle this. However, this year, both Oxford and Cambridge have introduced trailblazing foundation gears, which may start to undo this inequality, and it is a immense privilege to sit on this side of the bench with one of its graduates. Foundation years provide opportunities to talented pupils with high academic potential who have faced a fair disadvantage. They offer a year of Oxford teaching to help students reach their academic potential, to develop their self-confidence, and secure a place as a the top university. The scheme has already proven to be a success through the Lady Margaret Hall Pilots, which has seen three quarters of all students on the foundation gear later gained a place at Oxford, and 13 of these go on to earn a first-class degree. This programme is proof. If you tackle the attainment gap, pupils from disadvantaged pupils will thrive at Oxford. Alongside addressing the inequality attainment, we need to shatter perceptions and equip disadvantaged pupils with the support needed to make a successful Oxford application. This is a very important. This is a where in-house admissions specialists come in. Admission specialists provide impartial advice. They broaden pupils' fields of vision and they offer supports with the practicalities of admissions. State schools who have admissions specialists have skyrocketed up their admissions tables. Brampton Manor is a well-known example. This state school in Newham, where around half of all pupils are eligible for free school meals, has a team of five admissions specialists. This year they managed to get more pupils into Oxford than eaten. These programs are only in their infancy. If we want to increase their reach, we will need massive long-term investment. OXWitch is on that journey. These interventions are scaling up and they're doing so in the absence of a CAP system. A CAP would do nothing to incentivise this kind of intensive outreach. In fact, if a CAP was adopted, it would risk cutting short the progress that Oxwich has made. Funds would be diverted to find quick fixes with a focus on a quota system. getting wide-scale adoption of these programs will not be easy. Changing the story never is. But ultimately, Oxwich needs to focus its efforts on doing what works rather than introducing a fundamentally unhelpful CAP system. We need to create a system where your beginnings do not write your endings. Therefore, Mr President, I urge the House to reject this motion and to vote with the opposition tonight. Thank you.
