 I'll now look home to Jonathan Elan to continue the case for the opposition. Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. Stormsy, unfortunately, to my mind, just is not more relevant than Boris. Jasmine has me wrong. I'm a long-time rap fan in my day job. I'm a scholar of street culture. So I've examined the ways in which power and exclusion shape the lives of young people and indeed the society around us. And it's because I've studied these things for so long that I make the argument that I do. UK rap, and now, as we said, to a lesser extent, grind. We had a little bit of genre confusion earlier. are extraordinary musical movements. From the socio-economic margins, rappers have, in the words of ice tea, created something out of nothing. Rap has been out-selling rock music in the US. It's become pop music. It's key to our culture now in Britain and our culture industries, which is a leading aspect of our economy. It is extremely popular. Young people from across the socioeconomic spectrum look to it for inspiration, for hope. They see in it some defiance. they listen to soothe their souls to coax their bodies into movement to dance, be joyful, to love, to floss, boss and assert their identity. Okay, so I'm not going to argue that it's not wonderful music. It really is. It's rich. Its proponents aren't... I'm not going to argue that they're gang members. They're extremely talented, influential people. The entire cultural mainstream now takes its cues from rap and from street culture. So, by all of this, you could be tempted to think, well yes, it's highly relevant. It is relevant, but it's not supremely relevant. And this is the point that I want to make today. There is nothing more relevant than power. Rap music is important, it's interesting, it's wonderful, but it's not where the book stops. That is with those who have power. And of course, power, as you all know, very much exists within a hierarchy about those who have it and those who don't have it. And power is concentrated in very few hands and whether the power of all choose to be well known or to be discreet and hide away, they are the truly relevant people in our society. Power is literally the ability to do things, to get things done. And the way that power operates impacts deeply on people in all walks of life. Okay, and so this is why I would argue that Boris is relevant, because it's his views, his speech, and his actions that have such deep impacts and such a great number of people. Storms is still relevant, but less relevant. Because although he's a great artist with a big audience, and we've heard all this, and he stands at the apex of a rich culture and a rich scene, his power is limited, and his pronouncements have very limited effects. let me return to one of the examples that's been brought up by a good few of my fellow speakers, the famous Glastonbury performance in 2019. Stormsy performed at the main stage, absolutely breathtaking performance. He repped UK rap and grind to the fullest, and he's just one of the artists who do things like this in festivals all over the world. And we might remember what took place. Stormsy on that platform led the chant. oh Jeremy Corbyn that is what Stormsie did Boris competed in an election against Jeremy Corbyn and Boris won not necessarily overjoyed about this but Boris won the greatest Tory majority since Thatcher and he ended up forcing Corbyn from power so just compare these two individuals Stormsie called for political change and didn't get it Boris Johnson seized the political power. So it certainly seems, in this sense, that it's Boris, that's the most relevant. Stormsie is called admirably and rightly for justice for the victims of Grenfell, and they're waiting for it still. Boris could deliver it tomorrow, and he hasn't. So we've got to understand what's really relevant here. It's not the kinds of culture that the proposition are talking about, although it's special and it's wonderful and it's deep and it's so much of a part of people's lives. It's the power to shape and order people's world that is what relevance is really about. Absolutely. If relevance is significance to a situation, surely the fact that nothing has been done about Grenfell Tower is essentially irrelevant to everyone involved because they are gaining nothing from that. Well, that's the point, and the point is about power. The point is that Boris Johnson could give justice to those victims. So indeed, if the victims of Granfow want somebody to bring justice to their cause, he's the relevant person to speak to it. And the point is he's not listening to these pleas, but he's still the relevant person, I would say. But I appreciate your point. So really, a lot of what the proposition would say I would be in a certain amount of agreement with, but except for one key crucial difference, which one of our speakers has already mentioned. And this really comes down to this whole definition of relevance. Okay, and in my work I've looked at the concept of cool and I've looked at the extent to which rappers and other street cultural subjects influence how we dress, how we hold ourselves, the music we listen to, how street culture has influenced art and commerce. Okay, but the culture industries can harvest this cool surface relevance. And they can do that because they're powerful. Power is a relevance force. While the PM himself seems to be gathering up the rapper cliches, he's the individual who's accumulating the baby mothers, he's the ones illegally partying, burning through money fast. Storms, he holds himself very differently. Christian kind of pinnacle of a black British excellence and built an amazing scene and a wonderful career for himself. And I can accept, as the proposition of, I've asked us to, that he speaks to the experiences of a great number of people, a global majority even. He speaks to the disappointment and the disaffection of a younger generation. He speaks also to their refusal to seed hope. He's inspiring as an individual and as an artist. And he, along with others, Dave was mentioned, pot of paper, amazing. Many, many more aren't just great. great musicians. Aren't just great rappers. They're phenomenal musicians. They're rich in emotional range. Clever wordplay. And very importantly, of course, moving melodies. But as somebody sociologically trained, I would say that we always have to understand that culture is subject to power itself. Power is, I suppose, supreme over culture. The communities who produce rap music are marginalized themselves. rap music continues to be wrongly looked down upon. It's criminalised in various different ways that I've studied. Yeah, videos are taken down off YouTube. Rap lyrics and rap videos are actually used as evidence in criminal trials. Often in a way I'd find very, very questionable. So the question then becomes that if a culture is being marginalised, were by power, how can that culture be more relevant than the power that oppresses it? Yeah, and I don't want to personalise this, but we can see this operation power again, comparing situations that Stormsy and the Prime Minister have gone through. Power is all about the ability to do things and get things done, as I said. But despite everything he's achieved, the amazing things that Stormsie has achieved, he, like many other rappers, are still subject to marginalising forces. Okay, maybe his poverty is more historical, but he experiences racism and exclusion. Stormy, I don't know that many people know, there's been 2017, Stormsie having gained a bit of success, but he flat in Chelsea, that flat after a call was put in by the neighbours was raided by the police, who forced entrance and sat with Stormsey for a number of hours. He'd been asleep. He'd done nothing wrong. He was just sitting sleeping in his own home. Now let's think by contrast of Boris Johnson's behaviour in an apartment that we all own. So not even his own home. There have been questions about how that flat was decorated, who paid for the decorations. There have been questions about whether illegal parties were taking place there. And for a long time, the authorities even refused to investigate that. So look at that huge disparity between Stormsy having his flat rated for doing nothing wrong and the Prime Minister who may have done something wrong and the authorities deciding for a time in any event not even to investigate. So Boris has the power to be himself, to do what he wants and to change our lives. And although Storms he can speak to experiences of a great number of more people have had, yeah, it does doesn't mean that Stormsy is more relevant? Even if Stormsie is more popular, seen as a better judge of political issues, more respected, more like whether he has more YouTube views or Instagram, what's in the jigs, his lack of political power means that he cannot be understood as more relevant. So this motion can only pass if we believe what is relevant is what is cool for one for better words. But in my work I argue the opposite. What is relevant is the exercise of power, the powerful if they so want can exploit the urban poor and exploit communities of colour for their coup in order to make a profit. The powerful have the ultimate relevance, the capacity to do what they want, say what they want, to live well, to reproduce their privilege and escape accountability. Storms is famous and influential, but he's not relevant in the field of power. The elites shape the field that the rappers play on. The elites write the laws that censure the rappers, the elites like Boris Johnson are more relevant than rappers like Stormsy, however amazing rap is. And thus, I would argue, that the motion can't stand. Thank you.
