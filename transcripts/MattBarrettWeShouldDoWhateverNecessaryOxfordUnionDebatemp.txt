 And I now look to, unfortunately, our speaker, Ben Smoke was unable to make it this evening. So though not a presidential candidate, Matt Barrett, our director of strategy, very kindly stepped in the last minute. And I look to him to continue the debate for the proposition. Thank you, everybody, for sticking around. I want to start by talking about what side opposition is not here to do. We are not here to justify violence as a first resort, or violence for violence sake. Nor are we here to justify every violent or extreme protest there has ever been, because it is possible to go too far. It is also possible to be extreme for unjust causes, as we have rightly heard tonight. We are not here to defend that. So what are we here to defend? We are here to support what Malcolm X in this chamber in December of 1964 called intelligently directed extremism, extremism in defence of liberty, extremism in quest of justice. And I would add to that, Extremism when all else has failed. Extremism, when these stakes are so high that doing anything less than extreme would be wrong. Now, before we get to the important substance of the debate, I want to thank Molly for giving me the opportunity to speak tonight, even though it was at short notice. It's been a pleasant to strategize with you all term long. Obviously, I wasn't the first choice to speak in this debate. First of all, I was supposed to speak on the opposition. Before I was then yesterday, unceremoniously binned from the debate. I wasn't going to speak at all. And then about four or five hours ago, Molly then called me up again and told me that I would be speaking for the proposition. And now that is very certainly the sort of political flexibility that any of our presidential candidates could be proud of. So why am I here? Am I running for president? Maybe I am. But Matt, I hear you say. You're not in the manifesto booklet. We haven't seen your face plastered all over Facebook. You're yet to ask us if we remember the one time we met in Bridge, and if I can count on your support in the upcoming election, which of course is more important than any election there's ever been before. Well, you've caught me out. I am no presidential material, but I am running for something. I'll be running straight to the bar at the end of this debate. And I hope to see you all there. Now to the more serious, matter at hand. I have three points that I want to bring before the House tonight in a summary of what we on side of position have been saying, and perhaps to take a slightly more extreme approach than some of the speakers are on my side. I have three points. The first is that there are some injustices so great, some circumstances so horrific, and some systems so cruel that we are justified to resort to extremism, to violence, and to whatever is necessary to bring these down. The second is that we all use or permit the use of many extreme actions to defend things far less noble. Things like our national borders, things like private property. These things we defend with violence, with aggression, with extreme actions. I don't think we can justify that without justifying far, far nobler causes being supported similarly. Thirdly, many of the reasons that we have for dismissing extreme actions are not necessarily based on deep moral principles, but rather based on our own personal comfort and security. And I think we should question this and seek to understand where I discomfort with such extreme action lies. To my first point. Now, I want to say that it is true that violence is rarely necessary. But we are here to discuss the extremes. In fact, it is far better if we can use nonviolent protests to get to our aims. But that's not the circumstance that we are talking about tonight. There are some circumstances so dire that when all other options have been expended, the cost of of doing nothing is greater than the cost of whatever drastic action must be taken. We've heard tonight that being angry doesn't make you right. Perhaps this is true, nor does it make you wrong. I ask the house to look around the world and ask ourselves, may we call it just. I ask them to look at global poverty, at inequality, at corruption, at refugees who have been abandoned by states with the means to look after them, but not the will. I asked them to look at the violence committed by states against their own people and to consider the looming threat of climate change, where politicians are asleep at the wheel, safe in the knowledge that they will not be here to experience the horrors of their inaction. Now, it must be said that extreme protest can work, and in those situations, we should follow it. It works for three reasons. First of all, because it necessarily draws our attention. to whatever the issue is at a debate. It makes us think precisely because it discomforts us and it challenges us and it threatens our security. Second of all, it is often the only way to make the powerful care when we directly attack their interests, if we destroy their property. In fact, if we rise up against their regimes violently, that is often the only way to make them care. And if that is the only way to make them care, it is what we must do. Thirdly, we've heard that there is a risk when we become violent and become extreme, that we turn people away from our cause. I do not think this is the case. I think that because these causes are fundamentally just, and these are the causes we are talking about tonight, not the anti-vaxxers, not the capital riots, but just protest, just violence for people who are seeking their liberty and their safety. And I think that when people see this, they will see that their people are doing it for the right reasons and you will not lose support, at least not from the people who really care and see things for what it is. Now, non-violence does sometimes work, but it is clearly not enough. If it was, ladies and gentlemen, we would not have that litany of examples of horrible things happening in the world that we see. Second point, we already justify extreme actions on behalf of those in power to protect far less noble ends. Things like our private property, things like our national borders that keep those who do not have citizenship out. These are systems which often oppress. They are systems built on patriarchy, on colonialism, and on untold violence. Even if we generally think that extreme actions are wrong, if we think that extreme actions are wrong, there are circumstances when it is exactly those extreme actions, those forms of violence which people are suffering under. Now, can we honestly look in the face of somebody who is suffering violence and oppression and tell them that they may not justly fight back with the same force to secure their liberty and their safety when nobody else will? It is the truth that it is not worth condemning violence if by doing so we let it perpetuate. Actions, even extreme, should be considered right or wrong based on if they pursue a just cause, not based if they are performed by a certain state actor. We are quick to support the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian army in their defense of their territory against a violent Russian invasion. Perhaps this is because they are a state acting, but we do not always give the same rights to fight, justly to non-government groups, and I do not see why. We should. A third point, which is to ask why we resent such extreme actions, especially closer to home. Now, I do not think this is necessarily always, or in fact most of the time, because of some deep moral principle. It is because it is annoying or discomforting. An extinction rebellion protest blocking the road is not annoying. We don't find discomfort in it because we have some moral right to get to Tesco on time. We find it annoying because it is inconvenience. It slows us down. Now, even more extreme cases just take both sides of this to another level. Yes, they might in fact threaten our security, even our safety. But when what is on the other side of this, what is at stake becomes so much larger, it is possible for these things to be justified. I want to end with a few more words from Malcolm X in the debate after which this debate is named. He said, I do not believe in any form of unjustified extremism. But I believe that when a person is exercising extremism in defence of liberty, it is no vice. When one is moderate in the pursuit of justice, I say they are a sinner. Now, when the stakes are so high as they sometimes are, and that is what we are talking about tonight, it is not just forgivable, but obligatory to take drastic action. The cost of inaction is simply too high. And I would urge you to reflect on that as you walk out the door tonight and vote. Thank you very much.
