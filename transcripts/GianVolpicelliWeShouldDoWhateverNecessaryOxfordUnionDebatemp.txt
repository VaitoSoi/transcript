 I now look to Jan Verpicelli to continue the case of the proposition. I apologize for asking you. Thank you, Ms. President. Thank you everyone. Nice to meet you. I'm very honored to be here. Well, I know stood here 36 years ago. It's the first time I stood here. But I will try to make a point in favor of the proposition. the proposition. I would start by making a distinction. I think that when we talk about disruptive, even extremely destructive protests, we have to draw a sharp distinction between protests taking places in non-democracies, so people in Yangon, in Hong Kong, in Minsk, in Moscow, and protest, disruptive protests taking places in democracy. So I think no one here would even dare challenge the right of the brave people in Hong Kong or Yangon or Minsk to protest even violently against their governments, which are denying them a voice. So that's the only way they have to express their own opinion, of course. But I also argue that it is necessary that today protests, even in democracies, are disruptive. I would draw a line of violence as Angelie did because I don't think violence against people is necessary. What information? Please. The motion before us tonight is, this House would do whatever necessary. Whatever necessary. It doesn't talk about violence or non-violence. It says whatever necessary, which you'll include violence and things worse, even like war crimes. I think violence, as Angelis said, is usually wrong in democracy. And it's not the most. But it's not what the motion says. Well, I mean, I don't know. I do argue that it is. Rejected, I just started. So what I'm trying to say here is that for being successful, a protest today, has to be disruptive and it has to do everything necessary, up to the point of violence, arguably, just in order to be successful. There is no other way around it. So why is it so? I say that protests are about two things. First of all, it's convincing the others, right? It's recruiting new people. It's expanding your cohort. It's winning over people to your course. And the other thing, which is very important in my opinion, is that protests are a bit like muscle flexing. They're a bit about demonstrating to the government that you are a massive, strong, committed, organized force, ready to do almost whatever is necessary, or maybe whatever is necessary, actually, in order to bring about a certain outcome. So, when we talk about non-destructive protests, where you talk about peaceful marches maybe, I usually get very underwhelmed. they're not particularly effective, in my opinion. I used to report on protests. More importantly, I used to be Jeremy Corby's lodger. It would invite me to a lot of protests, that I would always be very underwhelmed, and it was always very, very enthusiastic about them. So, why is it so? I think that I found the reason. I think that this reason is why protests today have to be disruptive in order to be effective. So how the sociologist Zenef too fescii made a very important point in 2013 when covering the Gezi Park protests in Turkey. She found that protests, peaceful protests, marches, rallies were not impressive anymore because the internet had made it too easy to gather a lot of people in one place. That was not a signifier of commitment. There was not a signifier of being structured, of being a force to be reckoned with, of being something that would scare government into taking action. So today, just massing amassing a lot of people in one place and march and chant and your little dances is not enough. It doesn't take commitment for that. The bar to be effective, the bar to be convincing, the bar to scare the government into action is much higher. And that's why I think that, for instance, what Extensional Rebellion does by supergluing themselves to public buildings or maybe even flying drones over an airport in order to stop flights from departing, or even what the Gilesjean did in France, like stopping traffic, that's something that demonstrates commitment. That's something that demonstrates that you should be hidden. And just going around and marching usually does not work. I would add something else, apart from the fact that, of course, as I said, the Internet is a kind of steroid for your muscle flexing, so you have to raise the bar in order to be more scary to the government and force them into action. I would say that in this day and age, a lot of these people, and a lot of us actually feel that there is a, we feel we are running out of time. So there is a study by the Harvard University and the Stockholm University, which found that actually peaceful protests over time convinced other people to join your calls and to possibly vote for a candidate in a primary or in a general election And so over time, peaceful protests kind of work. But if you want immediate action, that does not work. If you're running out of time because climate change is impending, the climate crisis is coming. You have to scare government into action as soon as possible. And you have to be disruptive. You have to superglue yourself. You have to supergue your buttocks. You have to super glue your hands. I mean, of course, there is a risk that other people are going to try and press the same point on the Trumpian side or on the anti-back side, that's a danger. But I think this debate is not about allowing some ideologies to protest or not. I think that's just a different debate. What else? I also argue that... Order, there's a point of information if you'd like to do this. Please. You say the fact to me that you want to do... There was this. Only you design ideology. But if you were debating an identity website, or if you looked at the capsule here. Yeah. Of you, of making the something that you can define to find your going through ideas, but you come and want you release you to violent, so can you effectively let go of more national. Is this a question? Yeah. I think I understood. And I do think, first of all, that I didn't mention the Capitol Hill, riots at all or the capital insurrection, don't know, Trumpians, like rallies. And of course, I would actually argue that anti-vaxxers in most cases are in a way violent because they are harming the general population. So, yeah, possibly anti-vaxxers might be discounted. But that's debatable. I would also argue, though, that disruption works. So I would say that the kind of disruptive, sometimes unruly protests coming from BLM, have set the debate not only in the US, but also in a lot of the Western world. That doesn't necessarily mean that the scourge of racism has been addressed, but certainly it did raise awareness. Same thing for existential rebellion, possibly insulate Britain, which I really didn't like at all, but they certainly helped move the debate in that direction. I would say that the Gilesion, another movement I'm not really a big fan of, in France, they did force President Emmanuel Macron to hold a big national debate. So in a way, actually, it is just clear that you have to be disruptive in order to be heard. The kind of sanitization of protests that is being proposed by some in government, I think misses the point. It's trying to say that a lot of protests will be able to go on as they are, But I think that if you define protests of the disruptive element, you just end up with something that is not really useful anymore as a political tool to bring up your kind of points, your causes. I would also argue that, I mean, one point I hear a lot about why disruptive protests shouldn't be held or withstood, is that they're expensive. Like there was this figure in a home office document mentioning 30, $37 million spent on policing protests, I think that, first of all, I would say, do not police protest too much, but possibly I think some of the police officers should stay home rather than police protests. So they would be very happy, so everybody wins. And second, I would say that if 37 million pounds or dollars or euros or lira's or whatever you want is the price to guarantee the peaceful or not exercise of a political right, that's a pittance. That's not a lot. You should invest more into guaranteeing that right to be exercise. So that's why I urge you to vote for the proposition. You know,
