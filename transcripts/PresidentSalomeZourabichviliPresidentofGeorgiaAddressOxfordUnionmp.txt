 Thank you very much and it's an honor for me to be here in this venue which has seen very many remarkable personalities, very many remarkable women. I know that this is the place where Benetian Azir Bhutto was the first Muslim president of this union, and many other outstanding women, Mother Teresa, among others. And so I'm very proud to be able here to talk to you and to give you some of my views on the current situation. I will talk just a little bit. I don't like very much to do that because I don't think that being the first female president president in Georgia and in the region means that I have to specialize in dealing with questions of women in the society. It's one of the important issues. It's one of the important issues for me as a president in internal politics, but it should not, I think, define a woman president. But I just want to give you a few insights because I think that Georgia is not very well known. And it often happens to me that when I meet with people from other countries, they say, oh, you are the first female president, that must be difficult because they see Georgia as being a country that must be more orient than Europe and probably with very non-feminist policies and very strict separatism. separation of men and women. And I want to dissipate these mythical views because Georgia is not set at all. It has been from the very old times. Our mythology starts with women, Medea, for instance, and many others. Women, goddesses were in all the regions. Our first Christianity in the 4th century, comes through a woman, through a 17-year-old woman. Our first saints are women. Our main king queen, she was called the king, because she was so equal and powerful. At the time of the major prosperity of Georgia was a woman. And that continued over the times. And it's very interesting that the whole resistance of Georgia in the end of the 18th century, 19th century to the Russian Empire and before that to other empires was very much in the hands of women that were fighting Tizier and many of them were deported, were killed at that time. And so we have this history of women that are strong, that are resilient, And it's by no chance that at the time of the first democratic republic of Georgia in 1918, the first constitution gives the right to elect to women and elects in the first assembly, five women out of which one is the first Muslim women to be elected in any assembly. And it continues because at the time of Soviet repressions, women were directly submitted to these repressions, very often deported, very often deported with their children in Central Asia and in very difficult surroundings. And then we come to the latest period, which the latest, latest Soviet repression in Georgia before the independence in 1991, in 1991, was in 1989 when the Soviet tanks went into Tbilisi, used gas against the civilian population, and there too, the very vast majority of the population that was standing on the street was constituted by women, and the number of victims, women were the highest. So here I am, and hence my election is nothing of revolution in Georgia. It was taken, there are other things for which I had to fight and I have maybe today to fight, but not for the fact of being a woman, which is, if not quite normal, at least it is accepted. I would wish to have, not to have the problems that we have and that we share with many other countries today, which are linked to the society the way it has evolved, which is domestic violence, the fact that we still do not have equal pay in many of the civil service for women, but that is progressing. We do not have enough women in the parliament, and that is very much, I think, linked to the polarization, to the hate speech and to many of these today very harsh politics that we are seeing, and I think that there too we are no exception. But all in all, when I meet, with the population and I walk in the streets or in some villages and I ask to the girls that I meet and that come to take the selfies because that's happening elsewhere in the world and I ask them, would you like to become a president one day? And the answer is a very detached way. Yes, why not? So that's the major, I think, achievement for a woman president, that it becomes routine. we are confronted, and I think that you have come here to listen more of that, we're confronted to a very specific and difficult situation for Georgia, difficult with its at the same time rays of hopes. It's not completely bleak, but it's a very sensitive and complex situation. I will start with the first issue that, probably is one of the reasons why I did come back to this country, why I ran for member of parliament after having been foreign minister and then for president, and that is Europe. Because that's something that is very much part of Georgian history, that was always the aspiration of Georgia at different times, any of the times when it was not invaded and occupied by some of the empires that were around us. And you have to know that the capital city, Pellisi, was burnt down 26 times. So that gives a little bit of the impression of this small country in a place where everybody was attracted for different reasons, sometimes for transit, sometimes to control the access. to the seas or to other directions. At the time, the British Empire also was interested in this road towards India. And there was a time at the beginning of the 20th century when we had about 20,000 British soldiers that were on the Georgian soil. But unfortunately, they left before the last fight with the Russian Red Army in 21, and we were left alone, left alone, which is not something that happened rarely for Georgia. It usually was left alone at the most dramatic time. Many times it happened with Russia, with which Georgia had treaties of mutual support and so-called friendship because it was another orthodox state at a time when around were these Muslim empires and it was considered to be a natural form of alliance. And each time, when things came to the decision time, then Russia was nowhere to be seen, and Georgia was alone fighting, sometimes Persia, sometimes the Ottoman Empire. So that's the foundation together with culture and with the Christianity which forged the culture of Georgia, why the only perspective to which Georgia has ever looked outside of its own borders was always Europe. And that started back in the 16th century and it has been going on at different times, in different forms. But the more clearly, of course, at the time of the independence movement in the 19th century, when all the fathers of the independence were all Europeans going to Europe and getting their... education there, partly at least, and looking towards Europe. And that led us to the first independence in 1918, which created a democratic republic with a very democratic constitution, a very European constitution, maybe even a European constitution before some European countries had that type of progressive constitutions. But unfortunately, 1921 marked the end of this experiment of a democratic republic, and we had to wait 70 years to see the renewal, the rebirth of the Georgian independence. And right away in 1991, right away again, it was the European orientation that was in the forefront. And it's very interesting that a leader such as Shevardnadze, which you all know because he was a Soviet leader first and the Soviet foreign minister, when he became the president of Georgia, he was the initiator of a very pro-European, pro-NATO orientation. He is the one that set the trend together with the gas pipeline and this very important new decisions that were taken and that cemented the importance of Georgia at that time for our outside partners. And since that time, it has been a constant of Georgian politics to be moving down that road of European integration. So it started with the European Neighbour Initiative, and when I was appointed as a Georgian Foreign Minister, after having been a French ambassador to Georgia. At that time, what I heard from the people I was talking to outside in the diplomatic circles was forget it, Georgia will never be able to have access to the European Neighborhood Initiative because it's too far away. You're beyond Turkey, was then what we heard at that time. But pretty soon we got the possibility to join the neighborhood initiative. And then we joined the Eastern Partnership, the Association Agreement, the Visa Liberalization, the Free Trade Agreement, and finally, and that's a major step. And I think that it's not yet completely and fully appreciated, neither by the Georgian population nor by maybe some of our partners who gave it to us, the European perspective, which is a major state. step. Of course, at the same time, we didn't get the candidate status that our two other friends and partners of the trio, of the associated trio, got, which is the candidate status. And that, of course, created some form of this appointment in the Georgian population because they were aware of the fact that in technical terms we had probably gone down the road further, in terms of legislations adopted and many internal reforms that had been carried out over all these years, 30 years, of traveling that long road towards European integration. So some disappointment in the population, but at the same time, I would say, understanding and reconnaissance of the fact that if we got the European perspective and if the two others got the status of, of candidate, that was essentially thanks to the fight and the battle that the Ukrainian population was leading, and that in a way there was some political reason behind the fact that the two most exposed countries got this recognition, and that Georgia, which at that time was not so directly exposed, was judged on other of its merits. and there were some political reasons that explained that this difference was made. So that road towards Europe remains central. What is important to see is that all over these years for now more than 30 years, the support to the European orientation, and that is also valid for the support to the NATO integration, that support is unanimous in the sense that 80% or more of the population supports this way ahead, and it's a matter for consensus. So it's a very strong base for the future of Georgia, and it's something I will come back later on because I want to move now to Ukraine and Russia. But major thing to remember is that no alternative to the European perspective. And if you look at a map, it's very clear that there is nothing else that this small country of 3 million and a half can do but be turned towards Europe. That the Black Sea, which was a Black Sea for a very long time, and which at the Soviet times was certainly a wall, has today become a bridge and not only a bridge, it has become a space very important for all types of connections between our European partners on the other side of the Black Sea, the Caucasus and beyond the Caspian Sea with Central Asia. And the more Russia and the Russian lanes of transit are isolated and will be so probably for quite a time. the more this region becomes important to Europe. So there is no longer the sense that we are beyond Turkey. Now when we travel to different countries, it is very well understood that we are on the border of the Black Sea, which in a way is the border of the European Union. Because that sea, its stability, its peacefulness, and the possibility of cooperation, whether it's energy, or in other fields, connectivity is very essential for tomorrow's Europe. And there we all come together because it's a mutual interest, which requires that the Black Sea remains a sea of peace and cooperation. And that brings me, of course, to Ukraine. Ukraine is very central to Georgian history. It was one of our main partners and one of the main and one of the main and closest partners between the populations. And this war that started against Ukraine, this aggression from Russia, for us, is very even closer to our heart because it's very, very similar to what Georgia has experienced not only in the past, I mentioned the 19th century, but also in 1921, again in 1992-93, Right after the independence, when Russia not only supported the separatist movements, but was intervening directly and what few people know is that Georgia led a war for more than 13 months alone. There was nobody to come to support. There was no outside, even political support at that time. Georgia was quite not well known, isolated, and certainly Russia was not known for what it is today. So everybody was thinking, well, it's one of these separatist movements, it's an internal thing, so let them find their way, and they were not watching the Russian Air Force, the Russian bombings and the Russian bombings from the sea that was concurrently happening. And finally, in 2008, again a war, and again, not much reaction from the outside world. There was political support from our Baltic friends and from our Polish friends, but there was no real direct support. And at that time, the President of the United States and the President of Russia were at the Olympic Games. and that didn't seem to really interfere with their dialogue. So there is a sense that we have given our share. And of course, in this situation, on one side, the solidarity of the population and mine personally and of many of the leaders is entire. But the capacity of Georgia to add to the support that Ukraine is receiving in military terms, or in economic terms, is extremely limited and is even maybe more limited even by the fact that we have two occupied territories that represent 20% of our whole territory and where there are two huge Russian military bases that have been a little bit reduced due to the war in Ukraine they had to transfer some equipment and some personnel, but it remains that Russian forces are somewhere around 40 kilometers from the capital city, and not only the capital city, but from the main highway that links the eastern part of Georgia to the western part. So the strategic link the infrastructure and even closer to the gas pipelines. So all of that, of course, is an extreme vulnerability that we know that we have to deal with. But despite that, Georgia has been very resilient because these facts, this occupation, and an occupation that is not just a fact, it's also something that is every day, matter for the Georgian population. Because every day we hear that the Russians have come and have moved the occupation line that is not a border, which is not supposed to be transgressed by the Georgians that live on this side of the border or on the other side. And they take hostages every other day. And they close the crossing points so the families cannot meet or the people that need. health support on our side cannot get to the hospitals or to the education services that we are provided to keep these links that we have between both parts of our population so all of that is creating of course major tensions but that has not been enough to really make Georgia in any way change her course towards the European Union and towards NATO. We have twice a year NATO military exercises, sometimes led by NATO, sometimes by the United States. We have direct support to our army by the United States in terms of training and support for air defenses. but all in all, what we have is an army that is for self-defense, and even that it's a limited self-defense. It's trying to contain any advance of the Russians enough for the time that we need to get some outside support. So in those conditions, it is clear that we cannot be really part to the very courageous war that Ukraine, is leading against Russia, and we can only be supportive and morally supportive of something that has defeated really all the predictions. And I think that's the major lesson that Russia should take out of this war that it has started, that today Russia does not understand the outside world anymore, does not understand its neighbors. I'm sure that when Russia initiated this aggression and initiated it in a very psychological way to throw all these tanks against the capital city against Kiev, I'm sure that Putin was thinking that here in Ukraine there is this young president that has no experience where he is not going to resist to the extreme pressure and it's really an extreme pressure to see his country, invaded, bombarded day after day, and he has resisted. So first surprise. Second surprise, the Europeans have not started as they used to do, and in our case, to say, well, Russia must have some reasons, well, maybe it's Russian territory, as they did for Crimea, or thinking, well, we have some economic interest and this economy is what links us to, to Russia and we have to keep those links because that's what pacifies Russia, which was a long-hold idea about the relations between West and Russia. And again, Putin was wrong because this time the European Union made strong decisions, realized that it cannot remain dependent on the energy and other forms of dependency towards Russia has to have its own politics, and that was a matter for a large consensus. There were different differing views, certainly, during the decisions making, but all in all, this unity of the European Union remained and was a major factor. The other major factor was a unity between the European Union and the United States, which also probably the guess or the hope of Putin would have been that there would be dissensions and that this would not be a united front and that front has remained united. Another miscalculation was on the Ukrainian population that they would, after a while, get wary of this very dramatic, tragic war and of its consequences on their everyday life and that they would start resenting their government and there would be internal dissension. It has not happened. And what we have seen is an extremely united and courageous civilian population that is taking part to this resistance. Another miscalculation is that probably Russia was hoping that after a while, as it happens, our media, the Western media, would start forgetting about this war, and it would go to the second place, third place, fourth place, in the news, the everyday news, and in that sense the pressure would be less and less for Russia. That again has not happened. And so, in my view, that means that Russia has already lost a war. They're now turned to mobilization, which is bringing people that are actually not prepared at all, not well equipped to the forefront. And basically, they're using their minorities for that, more than central Russia and more than Moscow. but they're using them for as Cheracanon as they said. So what happens next? What happens next and what concerns Georgia and where we should be? I think two things are very important in strategic terms and are not necessarily purely the political criteria that the European Union has been using until now. One thing is that I, that's my conviction. And I'm one of the critics of some of the internal lacks of reforms or lack of movement, energetic movement in the directions where we should be going. And that's clear that we are not perfect. But I think that Georgia cannot afford to get a second no on the candidate status, and that we should get a candidate status as soon as possible, because that is a strategic message sent to Russia. It means there is no grey line, there is no soft belly where you can start to show your force if you continue to be humiliated in Ukraine. So this country is also part of this space, that is the next European space that clearly is not covered by Article 5, and we've seen now the latest events how this Article 5 line is important. And I'm sure that it's important to Russia, and that Russia knows that that's a no, and that they won't risk it, I think. But there is another space where Russia has to understand that it can no longer behave the way it has behaved earlier in Georgia, today in Ukraine, that covers also Moldova. So that's one very important factor, and we all know that the candidate status does not mean the end of the road, that the conditionality on the country becomes even more precise and is more demanding after the candidate before we move down a road that nobody knows how long it can take. But it's a message of hold, and the message of recognition for the population that has supported this orientation all these long years. And the message to Russia, and I think that second part is almost as important as the first one. And the second message that I want to also live with you, because I think it's very important. I think that the war that Russia launched in Ukraine, it's a third major global war. global war that we have on a continent where it was said and believed that there would never be a war of that kind again. And that, in order for that to stop, it is an absolute necessity that whenever the time comes for peace negotiations and that time will come, I don't know whether it's now, later, and And it's certainly an issue that has to be decided by the Ukrainians because they have paid the blood price to say when and how they want to discuss to recover the sovereignty of their territory. I'm sure and I think that President Zelensky said that here in this room that he will not negotiate on its territory. with Russia. And I think nobody can any longer negotiate on one's territory. The key for stability for a future Europe that will have some forms of normal relations with a normal Russia, the key to that is for Russia to be maintained in its own borders. First of all, to understand, to recognize and to assimilate where are its borders. Those borders cannot be, sometimes including Crimea, sometimes including part of Georgia, sometimes including other territories. Practically, Russia has been fighting for small pieces of land, sometimes bigger, with all its neighbors. And that means that there is a complete confusion, including among the Russian population, about where is Russia? And in the same way as a human being cannot develop itself and cannot become a man or a woman, if it doesn't know its body and the limits of its body, the same way Russia will continue to be this, I don't know how to qualify, this informal form that will start in constant. comprehensible wars around it because it doesn't know where to stop. And so the next negotiations have to be global negotiations. They have to cover all the occupied territories by Russia. And we have to come to an understanding of what will be, really. We have been lots of talks about that. But that is the key to then start thinking about a new European architecture of security, of cooperation, of the European. of everything. That opens the way then to everything because that opens a way to Russia becoming normal. And if we do not make Russia becoming normal and Ukraine has made a large part of that, then we will continue. Russia will more or less digest this non-victory or this defeat and we'll start again as soon as it can to again show its force. So I think that we are at a crucial time, at a time when we have to know what we want, and when I say we, it's the whole of the European neighbors, and of course, including the United States, we have to know what type of Russia we can live with. Thank you very much. You know, You know,
