 Thank you. Thank you very much. It is really a great pleasure and a privilege for me to have been afforded this rare opportunity to address the members of this. very noble and prestigious debating society, the Oxford Union. And I'm also glad to have been afforded the opportunity to come back to the city and the University of Oxford, a place which brings back many precious memories, of my childhood. My late father was a proud alumnus of Corpus Christi College, where he read P.P.E. And then follow that up with law. And during the 70s, when my father was a mature student, I spent many happy half terms here in Oxford visiting him. It is therefore rather fitting then that today, as I've been asked to reflect on my journey and experience, as king of Lesotho, that I should foreground his reign, which served as the foundation and the formative context of my own. I will, however, start by giving a brief history of Lesotho and its monarchy, because the role of the royal requires an embodiment and an awareness of that history. It is indeed, I believe, an office and an institution that is not frozen in time, but is instead changing current and of the times. Around the first quarter of the 19th century, a sizable part of southern Africa was plagued by violent upheavals and wars where different chiefdoms and clans were attacking each other and fleeing from one another. And as a result, an avalanche of refugees was unleashed across the region. Our history books referred to these wars and upheavals as Diffacani. During this period of Difakani, a clan called Baguina. had a chief by the name of Leboi, who later became to be known as Musheshire, who skillfully protected his clan and chiefdom against the severest effects of the upheavals, and who also managed to bring many of the refugees under the refugees under the people. his protection. Within a relatively short period of time, many clans and chiefdoms, recognizing Musharishu's leadership skills, conferred their loyalty and allegiance to him, and soon saw themselves as one nation of Basuatu, of the polity of Lesotho, of Lesotho owing allegiance to one great king, what we call in Susu Moraena Emuhul. It is worth noting that Musheshireh earned this loyalty, not just because of his strength and courage as a warrior, but more importantly, through his exceptional political and diplomatic skills, skills and also through his enormous capacity to perform acts of charity, clemency, and compassion towards his people. This ethic and vision continues to guide Lesotho's monarchy to this day. From around 1824, Lesotho became a centralized state with a hierarchy of political authorities where Muggeny muho, Lomushuetshue, exorcised executive authority over his people and country. The growth and development of this young nation was interrupted in the 1830s when white settlers of Dutch descent, who we refer to as the Boers, escaping British rule in the Cape Colony began migrating northwards and encroaching on Basuto territory. For years, Basu defended their territory against these intruders. But Mushuah Shui eventually realized that he could not keep them at bay forever. So in order to save the territory that was still left, he sought protection from the British crown. And after that request was granted, Lesotho became a British protectorate in 1868. Kim Mshuehushu died two years later in 1870. And one of the legacies of this period is that skillful navigation of trade-offs in search of the greater good for the people. The monarchy which continued to command the people's allegiance remained agile in the face of various forces, including colonialism. By the time Lusoto gained its independence from Great Britain in 1966, the monarchy had become a constitutional monarchy. It is against this backdrop that my father reigned. As a young prince, I witnessed him lead in the midst of political change, and I saw how the politics of the day affected the institution. of the monarchy. Throughout his tenure as Paramount Chief from 1960 to 1965, and as King and Head of State after independence, my father, King Musheshire II, along with a sizable proportion of Basuta citizens, often challenged the relevance of a British man model of constitutional monarchy to Basoto people. His views inevitably created tension between himself and then elected Prime Minister Chief Le Aboua Jonathan, who was adamant that the king should reign as a constitutional monarch in accordance with the Westminster system and rules. There seemed to be a lack of interest to draw on the insights of political institutions that preceded colonialism on the side of our post-independence political elites. After a political and constitutional crisis in 1970, Prime Minister La Abua Jonathan went on to rule as an early-elected head of government for another 16 years before he was toppled by a military coup in January 1986. The new military regime installed a six-man military council to oversee a mainly civilian cabinet. My father, who was heartened by the inclusion of civilians, hoped that he could work together with a new government to create a political environment that could usher in a new democratic dispensation that Basuto solely needed. Unfortunately, as time went on, serious disagreements emerged between my father and the chairman of the military council, Major General Lachania, as my father called for more decisive action against corruption. Relations deteriorated so badly that in early 1990, the chairman of the military council had three of his colleagues who he regarded as allies of my father arrested. Some members of the Council of Ministers were dismissed and my father was sent into exile to the United Kingdom. Even in exile, tensions continued to grow, culminating in the promulgation of several military decrees that removed my father from the third. throne and placing me as king in his stead at the age of 27. To this day, that incident remains one of the most painful experiences of my life. I say this because what happened in November 1990 is is completely alien to our culture. In Sissotocustum, it is an abomination for a son to occupy the throne while the father is still alive. Although that situation troubled my family and I, we agreed that I should hold the position until the rightful order could be restored. Because of a great deal of pressure from within the country and also from the international community, the military government eventually agreed to enter into negotiations with my father in London under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretary General. These negotiations paved the way for my father's return to Los Soto in July 1992, almost a year ahead of the 1993 general elections, which ushered in a democratically elected government. We all had high hopes that the new government would want to undo the wrongs of the military government and reinstate my father to his rightful throw. Most regrettably, our calls for justice were men. with intransigence. Of course as a family we were happy to have my father back in the country even though he was yet to be reinstated. I remained concerned about the impact of that anomalous situation on the institution of the monarchy and consequently I exercised what I would call my traditional prerogative as king to restore the rightful order. I did this by taking the bold and vertical, perhaps once in a lifetime action, of dissolving Parliament and dismissing the government. The resultant crisis triggered a series of events that ultimately restored legitimacy, integrity, and dignity to the monarchy. As expected, the interventions that ensued led to the reinstatement of both the government and the right-for monarch, His Majesty King Mushresha II. A year later, in January 1996, tragedy struck the family and the nation when my father died in a car accident. the mountains of Lesotho. As a result, at the beginning of February, I took the oath of office and ascended to the throne. But this time, my ascension to the throne was in accordance to our laws and customs. It does seem that in each generation, the question of the role of the monarchy is the is raised in new and politically relevant ways. One example of this is that two years later in 1998, in a disputed election, the opposition parties cried foul and mounted protest action against the ruling party. In so doing, they came and camped at the palace gates, and refused to budge. They explained that they had come to ask the king, who they called the father of the nation, to listen to their grievances about a rigid election. I should explain that the father of the nation is a traditional title that basso to bestow on their king, particularly during difficult times, when they seek solutions or guidance from him. This is what used to happen in the old times of Musheshire and his successes. Even with the modern institutions of arbitration and conflict resolution, in this time of crisis, some looked to the monarchy to address their grievances. As this conflict continued, and the protesters were forced to to vacate the palace gates. A large portion of the crowd burst through the palace gates and took refuge within the palace grounds, with some even going into the palace itself where they spent the night in the palace foyer. The opposition protesters camped in and around the palace grounds for almost three months, only leaving after political parties and the mediating body of the Southern African development community signed an MOU that delivered a political settlement. In this modern context, the monarchy was a sanctuary. To many, it seemed as though after episodes of political turbulence, the monarchy could provide stability. As I look back on my 26 years as king, I can say I have sought to uphold the Constitution as an important element that has been grafted into an institution with deep historical roots. Remaining faithful to the rule of law, captured in both our historical customs and our current laws, has served as a compass to help me navigate the complex situations I have often faced. In my role today, it is clear that in order to best serve the people, I must embrace both progress and tradition and actively live in the tension of the tension of the future and the past. Thank you for your attention. Let's begin with what you spoke about in your address about how you as a monarch are able to uphold tradition and also embrace the modernity of the 21st century. How have you gone about doing that and what is your hope for the suit you in the next of ten years? Well, as I said, it has not been easy. We've gone through very, very difficult times. difficult times over the years. But I have recognized that I am a constitutional monarch in Lesotho of the 21st century. but at the same time, the institution that I represent and the seat that I hold or occupy has historical roots and traditions. So it has been a tricky exercise on balance to be to keep modern and to be progressive and keep up with the times while at the same time being loyal to the traditions of the monarchy. But I think I have managed. This is not easy. It's something that I cannot have not done alone. I seek advice. I talk to people, family members and other people to help me, advise me, and to see how these two competing, sometimes competing, elements and competing forces can work together for the advantage of the institution and for the advantage of the people. And what's your vision for Lesotho over the next 10 years? Well, I want Lesotho to be a thriving democratic state, democratic kingdom. I want, I would like, and I hope it will materialize, I would like, I would like the suit to be economically prosperous, where our economy can strengthen to such an extent that it can provide jobs for those young people who are unemployed, loitering in the streets looking for jobs and just provide general welfare for the larger proportion of the population and your majesty the suitors faced high unemployment economic collapse and a weak currency over your time in power and before an African Union report called for the economic integration of the suit with South Africa how does the idea of an integrated the suit to resonate with you Well, is that an African Union report? I wasn't aware. But of course I'm aware that within Lesotho, admittedly within the Lesotho, a lot of, or some of our people have that view, that Lesotho and Basotu would be better served if we were part of a greater economy, if we were part of a bigger country, South Africa. And from what I hear and what I see on the ground, the majority of the people are still very proud of our heritage, the country, small as it is, poor as it is, that has been bequeathed to us by our forefathers. And they would like to keep Lesotho as an independent sovereign state. Having said that, I think a lot of people, me included, would want to engage in dialogue with our big neighbor, South Africa, to see how we can create agreements and structures that can help the sort of to be more prosperous as an economy in and more viable as in economy and as a country. So we should, I feel that we should remain as an independent state, but we at the same time engage in negotiations with our neighbors to see how we can work together, and the Soto should become a more prosperous and viable economic entity. And how does your role as a recognized standard bearer for the Catholic faith in Africa affect the way that you conduct yourselves in public life? As a standard bearer for the Catholic faith? Well, I wouldn't describe myself as standard bearer. Of course, I'm a Catholic. I've grown up in the Catholic Church and I'm a practicing Catholic. And as a Christian, a lot of what I do on a daily basis is guided by my faith, not only just as a Catholic, but generally speaking, as a Christian. And the rise in China and Russia have affected global powers. dynamics in Africa, something which is interesting considering the time of the millennium, we considered, I think, the 2000s as the century of Africa. To what extent do you think that aid has become a sort of trap of debt dependency in neocolonialism? Well, I'm not an expert in that, and many books and articles have been written. about the dangers of aid and actually the harm that aid over the years has caused our countries, particularly developing countries. But I, as not being a layman and not an economist, I really cannot give you a dividend of definitive answer and say this is the case I agree or disagree. But I know the debate is there and people will continue to debate the issue. But we'll see how things pan out. And where do you think Lesotho will find itself in the rising tensions between East and West? Well, Lesotho is open to everybody. We are friends with we have good relations with the People's Republic of China. We have good relations with the West, the European countries, the EU, and the American, even the United States of America and other North American countries. So we do open to do business with any with any country. as long as it serves the interest of our people. And in the last two years, we've seen an increase in our own country, sort of a global outlook, and amongst that we've seen huge protests for Black Lives Matter. Do you feel that that's affected the way that the West and the world views African countries, especially smaller nations? The protests of... Matter protests and the sort of general, I think, more global awareness that's come out of COVID. Yeah, I think, well, I've seen, I've been far away in southern Africa in Roussela, and I've seen the movement of Black Lives Matter. And I know a lot of our people in that region have found something in common with that movement. But I cannot specifically say how it is affected Lesotho or Basutu people. But the only thing I can say is that I'm glad that the issue that Black Lives Matter movement raises is now in the public arena. And I hope people can take attention and those issues can be addressed. Issues of racism, discrimination can be addressed and taken seriously by all. So we, even in the SOTU, that's what we would want to happen. And let's talk about COVID-19. Could you talk to us about your experience as a world leader having to navigate the pandemic? It will probably, you know, it would be easier for the government in Lusoto to answer some of these questions, particularly that one. But I have, in Lusoto, I have observed and seen how COVID-19 has impacted the economy. It has been a very difficult time. A lot of people have lost their jobs. A lot of businesses have gone under, and it's the same almost everywhere across the world. It is just that it is unfortunate that we, in the fight against COVID-19, we received the major, weapon, which is the vaccines rather late in the day, we would have preferred to get them earlier in the fight. But we have vaccines now and people are getting vaccinated and so that will help. But the economy will take a long time to recover. And your Majesty, as a constitutional monarch, how do you cope with the pressures of being a royal and in the public eye bearing the weight of the, I suppose, responsibility being example to your people? Well, I think I've been, I've coped quite well. I, I was saying to a group of students elsewhere earlier on today that I'm very fortunate. The pressures that I see, particularly in Europe, other, the family, royal families, the pressures that they live under. I don't live, and me and my family, we don't live under the same kind of pressures. So I'm relatively free to move around the sort of and to mingle with ordinary people. So I really don't have the kind of burdens and pressures that other monarchs suffer under. So in that regard, I'm very blessed and happy that is the case. Well, I'd like to leave some time for audience questions. If you have a question, could you raise your membership card? I recognize the member on the front bench just here. My microphone. Thank you. Thank you, Your Majesty, for speaking with us this evening. I believe you said it had a very good case for the role of the monarchy in domestic affairs. What would you say the role of the monarchy is in the foreign relations of your country? Well, I can only speak for Lesotho. Of course, the issues of foreign affairs are handled by the government and the foreign ministry. But my role as a monarch in Lesotho is to, with incorporation and with the guidance of my government is to promote Lesotho and to promote Basotu and to as much as possible to let the world, the rest of the world, know that Lesotho exists. And whenever we need assistance, sometimes it is me that have to go out and and see assistance so but again I don't do that I don't go out on a tangent and do things by myself I do it within the scope of what the government of the day and what the priorities of the government are the prior the priorities are of the government of the day thank you and I recognize the member in the Pladshirt at the back So given Lesotho's legacy of diplomacy over the years, oh, sorry. Thank you. Given Lesotho's legacy of diplomacy over the years, how do you balance the acute need for your biggest neighbor, South Africa, dealing with, say, their water crisis, with your ambition of doing business with logistical neighbors that are far away, such as Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana, that might be able to use many of these resources, but are confined by this big neighbor that has you tied in. I'm not sure I got that. How do you manage balancing sort of the relations with your neighbor, South Africa, with maybe the ambitions for relations with other neighbors further afield? Yeah, exactly. So being confined by South Africa, how are you able to do business with your neighbors like Swaziland, Mozambique, Botswana, while still understanding the needs of your acute neighbors, South Africa, and the water crisis that you might hold over them. Well, let me try to address the issue of water, because that's a very important matter. We have a project, a bi-national project, between Lusoto and South Africa, called the Lysotu Highlands Water Project, where the two countries have agreed that Losotho will supply water. We've built dams up in the mountains when we're supplying water to South Africa on a daily basis, and we get compensated. And there's a treaty that regulates that agreement. So it does not... prevent us if we eventually wanted to to enter into agreements with Botswana, for example. And I think there is something in the pipeline that we will probably agree on to also supply water to Botswana. So whatever we do with South Africa on the water, the Tichy that we have now, does not prevent us from doing water deals with other countries. But of course, as you know, under international law, because the water that flows from the Soto will flow into South Africa and Namibia, we have to let everybody make them aware what's happening with the water upstream. But with other trade matters, we, it's a very amicable, I would say we have a very amicable relationship, particularly those four countries, the Soto, South Africa, Eswatini, in fact, 5, Botswana and Namibia, all members of the Southern African Customs Union. So we work together within that organization. And I call upon the member just in front in the green. Thank you very much, Your Majesty, your presentation. I come from the old kingdom of Ethiopia, where his imperial majesty, Haile Selassie, I failed in 1974 to transition to constitutional monarchy. And as I stayed here in England as well, people are still struggling to understand the legacies of my monarchies to understand the current modern world. And as we have seen in Swatini as well, people are still asking what role still monarchies can play now or even moving forward? What benefits does a nation have still having a constitutional monarchy, especially as we continue to struggle with the legacies of monarchies? So if you can just give us some advocacy or more. The last part, can you, what's the question? So the question is, what benefits can a nation still have, in your view, to continue to have constitutional monarchies as we continue to struggle with legacies of monarchies at large? Thank you. Well, again, I can only speak for the Soto. And I think, as far as I'm aware, now and even for the foreseeable future, the majority of the people of Lesotho still value the institution of the monarchy. They see it as a symbol of unity, and it is something that they cherish. And although in a practical sense, there's nothing, I think on a daily basis that I do to sort of, as I say, unlike governments where to implement programs or economic programs. But the value which I think the Lusutu monarchy still holds and has is that it is very much seen by the people as a symbol of national. unity and the symbol of the state of Lesotho. So as far as the Lusutu is concerned, that is where the value lies. And the last two years have been some of the most tumultuous internationally, many of us have seen. Have you found that role useful, particularly then? Do you feel that you were, I suppose, able to bring extra value to Lusutu as we face the pandemic and all of the chaos that came with it? Yes, I think so. I would like to think that during times of crisis, the monarchy is there as something that can give people hope. And as I said, it's a symbol of unity. And I would like to think that during these last couple of years when times are difficult people, whatever I have said from the throne and whatever I do does give people hope and inspires the majority of the people. I recognize the member on the end of this bench here. challenge of your reign has been? Sorry. What do you think the greatest challenge of your reign has been? The greatest challenge? Yeah. Yes. Yeah, it's a difficult one. Well, the biggest challenge I have found, as I said, as a constitutional monarch, is that we are still within the country, there's still a large proportion of the people who would want me to help out and intervene in difficult times. traditionally, that's what the role, that's what the king does. But now being a constitutional monarch, there are no constitutional or legal instruments available that allow me to act in that way. So I find it challenging sometimes when that happens. And I feel that there isn't a great deal that I can do to help. So that, I would say, would be one of the biggest challenges. And there are other challenges which I face from time to time. But I think that one would be a major one. And I recognize the member just next to you. Thank you, Your Majesty. Has there been anyone who has any constitutional monarchs or world leaders that have inspired you throughout your reign? You grew up in Britain, so you'll be very familiar with our own queen's reign. So has anyone inspired you or given you an example of what it is meant to be to be a constitutional monarch? Well, as you said, I've grown up in Britain and I have observed how her Majesty the Queen has conducted herself and how faithful she has been to her office and to the people and how diligent and determined she is in. in the performance of her duties. So I've admired how Her Majesty carries out her duties. And one would say, yes, she has been inspirational. But I'd also draw inspiration, not only from monarchs, but from other people, other leaders that I see, or read about in the past or even in the currently. So I try to draw inspiration from various kinds of people, not just monarchs of people I'm in the same situation or the same position with. I will take one final question. I recognize the member just on the front front. there. Thank you so much, Your Majesty. My question was, as a monarch, what characteristics constitute a good monarch? What characteristics constitute a good monarch? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I honestly, as I honestly, as I I said at the end of my statement, for me I found that being faithful to the rule of law, to the Constitution has served me well. But beyond that, I think one has to try to listen to the people. although we're not a monarchy by its nature is not something that is not a democratic institution. But even then, particularly in the sort of where the roots of the institution is so much based on what the people decided all those years ago. So you have to keep your ear on the ground on what people are thinking and what people are thinking, and what people are saying, and so that in what you do and in what you say is you try your best to that it is falls within the wishes of what the majority of the people want and what the majority of the people aspire for. So basically that's how I would answer that question. Well, Your Majesty, thank you so much for joining us. We'll finish with a question that we ask all of our speakers. If you could give our audience members one thing to take away and think about for this week, what would that be? Sorry. If you could give our audience members now one thing to take away and think about for this week, what would that be? For this week? Yes. Oh, they can think about it for longer if they like. Yeah. Well, I don't know what we... I can, I can, I'm not sure what I can give you as something to chew on for the rest of the rest of the week. But, you know, we live in interesting times. We live in an era of conflict. As you are very much aware, there's dangers of greater conflict. here in Europe, in Eastern Europe, between Russia and Ukraine, that has caused so much tension. Even on the continent of Africa, there are pockets of tension and conflict. We have conflict in Ethiopia, we have conflict in West Africa, and so on and so forth. So one, I think as young people and as future leaders, I would like you to think about how in the future and in medium and long term, we can find a way of once and for all finding peace. between all the nations of the world. I know it's a difficult issue because countries from the beginning of time have had competing interests and as a result there's always been friction and conflict. But one would like to think with the experiences that we have had in our lifetime and in the lifetimes of our forefathers, our grandfathers, that really as humanity, we have to find a better way of sorting out our differences so that we can live in peace and harmony on this thing. without having to resort to threat of force of arms. So basically that's what I would leave you with to think about and see how we can live in peace. Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us and please join me in thanking, His Majesty. Thank you.
