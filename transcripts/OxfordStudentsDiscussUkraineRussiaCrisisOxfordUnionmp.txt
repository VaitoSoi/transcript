 On the 24th of February 2022, the Russian Federation launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine starting the largest interstate conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The Oxford Union has hosted an open discussion on the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. The following speeches are the views of the members and do not represent the views of the Oxford Union. Members and guests, welcome to this afternoon. open discussion on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine. There is no motion to debate, so we invite you to come and say any words at the proposition dispatch box. Speeches will be five minutes with a warning bell with one minute to go. And please do give your membership card or your bod card to our secretary, the Honourable Librarian elect. I look for a first speaker, and I recognize the press and sponsorship officer. All right. Thank you, Madam President. I'm going to focus something that perhaps hasn't been talked about, and that is the use of historical memory and imagination to justify this attempted conquest or kind of subjugation of Ukraine. And I speak about this with some degree of expertise for I do a very niche degree called the M. Phil and late antique in Byzantine studies, but my real research interests are in the early Slavic world, I research early Rus, which is the antecedent, or a series of polities, to what's now modern day Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The argument made by the Russians is quite simple, that back of the day, back of the days of Kiev and Rus, and indeed, in earlier Slavic history, there was this kind of unified East Slavic polity, and therefore they can make a perennialist justification for the subjugation of Ukraine. After all, there was a so-called Kiev and Rus, where Kiev was the center of East Slavic civilization, where putatively they were indeed independent. But the reality is that once you look at the history, it is false. For that view of the history is really looking at a few aberrational circumstances in early Slavic history when you had unity. For most of early Slavic history, you did not have these all-powerful Grand Princes of Kiev with unified rules, as we see with Vladimir I, or Yaroslav, the first. But what you see instead were independent city-states, independent polities that operated. Indeed, in between the reigns of Vladimir I and Yaroslav I, the first, we saw a huge degree of fractricidal kind of civil wars between different cities. Following Yaroslav's death, we see an even greater series of conflicts. And following the death of Vladimir the second Monomach, we see a complete disintegration of any sort of political coherence to early Rus. They truly become independent. Indeed, by the 12th century, by the 13th century, the center of early Slavic civilization and moved away from Kiev, but into a relatively now little-known city called Sustil. Now, I've given you lots of historical facts, but I think the takeaway here is very simple. The norm in East Slavic history, especially early Slavic history, that Vladimir Putin wishes to use and legitimize his rule, was of political independence and decentralization, not of autocracy and his pan-Slavic unity that he seeks to emulate. And therefore, we should always recognize what history we are teaching. For in Russian schools, as he'll speak of Vladimir Iroslav I and focus on these early Russian leaders. Or they speak of Peter the Great or Ivan the Terrible, forgetting that in many cases these were again aberrations when in the same time periods, the leaders before and after them were far weaker and less autocratic. This autocratic Russian Empire, it is truly construction of historical America. with little to do with real history. So what I want to talk about now and in relation to this Ukraine crisis is again to look at what we can learn already, because however this crisis ends, and I hope it is with Ukrainian victory over the Russian aggressors, we can still learn something as democratic people about the value of norms and values, about morality and what it means to fight for these things, because for too long have we in the democratic world dismissed morality or not taking it as a serious topic of debate. We need to talk about morality because it matters to people and because there is a price for freedom. And so the conflict in Ukraine is an opportunity to look at these bigger ideas because it's not just an attack on the people of Ukraine. It's an attack on the ideas of sovereignty and democracy. And I think we should take inspiration from the heroism of the humanism, Ukraine because they've shown that there is a price for freedom, that sometimes you have to fight for it, and that's something that we at all democratic states should take inspiration from. And so I want to really stress that this war did not start seven days ago. This war started eight years ago. It started since the independence of Ukraine. Ukraine has always had this struggle for values, and it's time, it's only now that Russia has taken the final action and we should have done better then. Where were the weapons when this crisis started earlier? We had several months of warning. US intelligence was telling us very early something was going on. Why were sanctioned packages not ready? It's because we don't have a red line. We don't have in democratic states this moral framework which would allow us to say that enough is enough. That when this red line is crossed, we don't have, we We will do this. We had no structure, and that's why we need to take action now. And I think it's perhaps easy to say that, oh, well, we didn't do it then, and now we're taking action now, you know, now we're passing sanctions, now we're saying military aid, but that's not enough. We owe this to the future generations of Democrats and people of democracies to create this moral framework to set this red line, a red line that says the buck stops here, that when these red lines are crossed, we will do these actions. And talking, this is all a little bit abstract, red lines, morality, what does that mean? And I think we need to focus now on the people of Ukraine, because that battle is not lost and we cannot let it lose. And so what I hardly recommend is economic war against Russia. We must cut imports, we must cut trade, we must cut trade, sanction every Russian industry. And what really hurts is that this will harm good Russian people, people who are peaceful and who do not want to engage in war. But that is, again, the price of liberty, that unfortunately good people have to suffer so that we can build a better future. And in terms of the military, we should be in Ukraine if it was not for nukes. The reason that we cannot go in and protect the people of Ukraine with the force that our morals that this red line determines is because we would start nuclear war. So instead, we've got to wage war under these conditions. We've got to send everything we have to Ukraine. We've got to send tanks. We've got to send weapons. We've got to send planes. We've got to send drones. We've got to send everything that can allow Ukraine to fight without risking nuclear annihilation, because that risk is too big in these circumstances. And just as my last point in terms of solidarity for the Ukraine people, I wholeheartedly recommend that we integrate Ukraine into the EU. Let's sign the agreement that brings Ukraine to candidate status, which is a symbol of bringing our solidarity with Ukraine. And this isn't a question of bringing European or democratic values to Ukraine. This is a question and this is a decision that brings Ukrainian values to Europe and democracies because they show that when you fight for freedom, you can take a stand against autocracy and against darkness. As Zelensky said, this is a battle of light over darkness and we, for the future of all Democrats, for the future of Ukraine, for all people, we have to make these red lines and we have to agree when enough is enough. Slava Ukraine. Thank you. President, there's good news and there's bad news. The last week and a half has led to the front lines and the headlines of the world being filled with images and talks of war in Europe, of war in Ukraine, of a fight as the previous speaker was mentioning, of democracy versus tyranny, light versus dark. The good news is that so far, the free world has upheld its values. It has taken a stand which many, including President Putin, did not believe was going to happen. Many, including on our side of the world, doubted that we would take a stand, that we would defend our values. And the good news is that we, for once, defended what we believed and took action. We didn't do so in the past, 2008, 2014 spring to mind. But what we need to learn from this crisis, from what we're seeing around the world, is that democracy and values need to be defended. Further good news comes from the fact that our friends in Ukraine are taking a stand. It shows that people in the modern world, people, average civilian, citizens, take a stand when it matters. Because we have, for too many years, believe, the values we believed in, the values of democracy, liberty and freedom, that we took for granted. We weren't going to be defended by the average civilian. We depended on our militaries to defend them from external threats and we would just sit by. But what we've learnt from the Ukrainian population and from some brave volunteers from Europe is that people are willing to take a stand. And that shows that the fight for democracy is not over in the West. The good news continues in a way out of all this darkness because the Ukrainian army is holding, the Ukrainian population is holding, and the West has awakened. Germany and many other nations in the West have changed their policy responding to a drastic change of international policy. on the Russian Federation side and of the situation in Europe. Yet we must remember that the bad news are there. Most of us wake up and read about a wall on our newspapers. And that hasn't happened, as many people these days have mentioned, for over 75 years. That is bad news. Further bad news is that it takes diplomatic effort. It takes an effort on the side of many member states of NATO and the EU to get people to move. It's not an innate reaction of many states in Europe to come to the aid of nations. Among them, the Kingdom of Spain or some of the early German reactions, stand out as people and states that still haven't realized that Vladimir Putin is our enemy. And that is the further bad news, that Europe now has a clear opposition, a clear rival that comes to. and threatens our way of life. That is bad news, not because of the existence of the fight that we are going to have to fight, but because for 70 years we hadn't seen war, for 30 years we believe we didn't have to fight a war, and now the bad news comes that we need to do it. It's a challenge that we must rise to, but it's a challenge that as any Democrat, as any proponents of democracy, we must be saddened by because it shows that there is still a long way to go, and there is still a lot to fight and a lot to lose and sacrifice. in order to maintain our ways. We must learn from the crisis this week, and as the previous speaker was mentioning in the last eight years, to defend our values, to aid our friends, and to assert our views, it has for too long gone and accepted that the West does not intervene. The West doesn't do actions. We support and stand by our friends, but we don't support. And I think if anything comes out of these bad news in the headlines. It must be the good news that the West has decided to take a proactive boots on the ground stand. Even if not directly confrontational with our rivals, physical and on the ground presence of Western values must be felt. No more sanctions and empty words, but there must be support on the ground to our friends and allies here in Europe and abroad looking at places like Taiwan. We must make sure that our friends believe that we are behind them and not just 30 miles behind them, as it says in Blackadder, but we are there with them in the trench, if possible, and in a nuclear threat. Not possible, but we must make sure that we are there with our friends fully and as far as we can do so. Thank you very much. All news becomes old news very quickly. Just one month ago, everybody believed that Boris Johnson would be sacked within the week, would resign there'd be a leadership vote. Everybody believed there were going to be extremely serious consequence. This was topping the headlines every single day, every single week. This was going, something was going to happen. And yet, very, very swiftly, we move on. When was the last time you saw a news story about conservative scandals? Weeks ago now. Nobody's talking about it. Because news moves on very quickly. The structure of the modern news cycle is such that things peak very high, but for a very short amount of time. And we cannot let this happen with the world. Ukraine. Yes, it is the most pressing issue of the day now. There are speeches, there are protests, it's topping the news headlines every single day. There are live feeds about how the war's going in Ukraine, but this will not be the case in a week. This will not be the case in a few days, even, when the next news story comes up, when the US next send a ship between China and Taiwan, when the next internal British politics scandal happens. So what we need to do, ladies and gentlemen, is find some policies that have a long-lasting effect on Russia that actually force them to suffer beyond the confines of the most recent news cycle. What scares me is not Germany's slightly tardy response. It's not the fact that Russia and China probably colluded to set the date for the invasion. What scares me is that the result of the United Nations Security Council vote on the resolution condemning Russia was 11 to 1. And what scares me is the fact that there were three abstentions. And whilst China's is probably a positive sign in the sense that at least they didn't vote against, what scares me is that why did India and the United Arab Emirates abstain? That shows a dangerous apathy on the part of many leaders around the world. This is not an issue we can be apathetic about. This is not something we can leave for the next few weeks. India and the UAE have no real reason to vote essentially in favour of Russia. They have a no gas dependency like Germany do. They have no massive trade links with Russia. There was no need for them to not vote in favour. The fact that they abstained is a significant concern on my part. If you look at the graph of the value of the ruble over the past 10 years, it has remained roughly, roughly steady with two massive dips in 2014 and this week. But the fact is, after 2014, yes, the Russian economy tanked for two weeks until nobody cared anymore. And then investors who follow economic trends and not moral values start investing back in Russia again because their gas is profitable. Gas is always profitable. And so what we need to do is find long-lasting solutions. Where does Russia's influence come from? How can we target the most? How can we make sure that they suffer not just whilst people are posting hashtag stand with Ukraine? but for the next decade, for the next eight years, until they find the confidence again to invade somewhere else. So where is their influence coming from? Their influence is coming from gas. Let's cut off their gas right now. Yes, we'll suffer, but we can very quickly build a new pipeline. We can build it through Turkey. There's plans for one already. We can build it up through the Balkans. There's plans for one already. We can import LPG for the near future to maintain that most of Europe can actually supply itself over the winter until summer heads. This is not particularly impressive. It's not going to make the headlines, but it's a response that will genuinely hurt Russia. Where else does their international influence come from? It comes from the fact they used to be the Soviet Union, and so they retained a lot of prestige. They're part of a lot of international organisations. Okay, well, Ukraine has just called for them to be removed from the Security Council. That might be impractical in the near future, but let's work towards it. And whilst we're doing it, every single time they make a speech in the United Nations, like every single diplomat leave. It happened the other day. It's perfectly feasible. Yes, it may be a token gesture. Yes, it's not going to accomplish anything. It's not going to help any Ukrainian citizen. But it is a powerful symbol that we are serious about this. Let's not hear what Russia have to say. Let's not hear what a war crime state wants to tell the United Nations. Let's undermine the international influence that, frankly, is one of the only things that's holding up their power. Similarly, their membership of bricks. Why can't that be suspended right now? It's not like they're bringing any benefits to China or India or Brazil or South Africa. it's not like the Russian economy is actually influential anymore. Those days are long gone by. Those countries have no gas dependency. So why can't they suspend it right now? Undermine Russia's international influence. Let's ban all travelling ballet troops and cultural things that are sponsored by the Russian state that maintain the propagation of Russian culture around the world. These are the things that will genuinely hurt Russia. Let's work towards admitting Ukraine into the EU and NATO. They've been working for decades to do it anyway. They're practically up to the required economic and political levels. It's not like there's much corruption anymore, and the stuff that is remaining can be eliminated within a few years. The membership requirements for NATO are relatively lax anyway. It can probably be done within a year. These are powerful symbols that need to be worked towards behind the scenes. We don't need to care about headlines anymore. We need to care about practical actions that will genuinely impact Russia beyond the duration of the next news cycle. Thank you. So thank you, Madam President. It's a great honor to speak in this debate, and also it's a great honor to follow all the previous speakers. So I just like to structure my five-minute speech around three key points. The first one is, how have we got here? The second one is, what should we be doing now in the West? And the third one is, let's look to the future and actually formulate a long-term strategy. So these are the three points I'm going to talk about today in the five minutes that I have. Firstly, how have we got here? Well, I think it's quite clear that the West, unfortunately, is shown a complete lack of strategic coherence. Since the first Russian incursion in Chechnya, there was a lack of serious and impactful sanctions against Russia. Then we had Russian incursions in Syria, and we also had Russian incursions in Georgia and also in Moldova. And there's also been election interference in the United States. So we've seen repeated examples of Russian incursion. And yet we haven't actually seen a strategically coherent response from the West. What we should have seen was a constant round of diplomatic and economic sanctions each time we saw a Russian incursion. We didn't see that. And that was a fundamental error. So I think we've got here because of a lack of strategic coherence from the West and a lack of unity. That is a fundamental issue that we have to face up to now. What should we be doing now? Well, I think we have to be clear that Russia is having some logistical and military difficulties at the moment. I think that's something that actually we in the West should talk about a lot. The Russian military actually is struggling massively in Ukraine and we should pay tribute to incredible leadership of President Zelenskyy who was showing a great deal of valor and courage. And actually perhaps if the previous president of Afghanistan, Ashrafghani, it's showing that same courage and morality, then perhaps Afghanistan would be in a slightly different position, but that's purely counterfactual. But I think what we should be doing now is we should be focusing on the fact that we need to supply more defensive and offensive weaponry to Ukraine. We need to strengthen our sanctions regime, both diplomatic and economic. I agree with the previous speaker. I think cultural sanctions are important as well. And in diplomacy, symbols and iconography matter a lot, so I completely agree with that. But I think that's where we should limit our focus. I don't think that we should have boots on the ground because Russia has a nuclear stockpile of over 6,000 weapons. So I think it would be irresponsible to put boots on the ground. And we do not want a huge escalation of this crisis where potentially we could see World War III because that would lead to millions and millions of casualties. So I don't think we should have boots on the ground, but we should be strengthening our sanctions regime. For example, tackling the London laundromat. That's definitely one of them. We should also be banning Russia from various football and other sporting competitions. And then moving forward, what do we need to do? Well, the oil and gas industry accounts for 60% of Russia's exports. If Nord Stream 2 had gone ahead, then Germany would have been receiving 70% of its natural gas supply from Germany. I'm glad that Chancellor Schultz is, again, another leader who's actually shown a lot of courage in freezing Nord Stream 2. But what we need to do is fundamentally wean ourselves off in Europe, wean ourselves off our reliance on oil and gas. This actually provides us with a great opportunity to move towards a sustainable green economy. and invest in renewable energy. This is actually an incredible opportunity in a way, notwithstanding the fact that there is absolutely terrible tragedy in Ukraine, but at least we can say that actually the West is now finally realizing that the dependence on Russian oil and gas is fundamentally crippling our ability to respond strategically to the Russian threat. So moving forward, we can now actually invest in renewables, transform our economies into the green economies of the future, and so that we're not relying, on oil and gas from a authoritarian regime. But also moving forward, we need to just accept one point, which is that if there is a danger of making Russia a complete international pariah, because if we want a resolution to the Syrian crisis or the Libyan crisis, or if we want cooperation over the Iran nuclear deal, or if we want cooperation over climate change or improving cybersecurity, then we have to recognize the fact that Russia is an important player in these fields. So all I want us to be is completely conscious of the fact that there is a danger, there is a danger if we make Russia a complete international pariah. Because ultimately on these issues like cybersecurity, we do need cooperate. You have to have cooperation with Russia because Russia is responsible for actually many crippling cybersecurity attacks. So we have to just be conscious of the fact that there is a clear and present danger if we make Russia a complete international pariah. Now, it's a separate debate how far we want to go in alienating and isolating Russia. But moving forward, I think our main goal should be to try and wean ourselves off Russian oil and gas imports and try to diversify our energy supplies. And energy security and energy independence actually must be a very important goal for the West moving forward. We should also, particularly in the UK, wean ourselves off dependence on Russian money in the London property market. And I'll just end by saying this. We need to have the courage of our convictions and be brave on this. And I agree with previous points that people have made. We have to accept some hardship and we have to accept some pain in order to defend the principles of liberty, democracy, the rule of law. These are very sacred values. And we have to be prepared to take some collective sacrifice and share some collective pain in order to defend these freedoms and these values. Thank you very much, Madam President. I agree almost entirely at everything that's been said here so far, especially the importance of treating this not as a rogue event, but as part of a timeline that started in the 1990s with Russia's desire to keep in touch with its former Soviet republics and can be charted through its actions in Chechnya and Georgia in 2008 in Crimea and then the increase in interaction it has with the internal operations of the Kazakh and Belarusian states. These show that this event is not a mad move by a rogue state, but instead something inherent to the Russian psyche. And in fact, I'd go further and say a sort of a death spasm of a dying great power. Russia and Mr. Putin and his team especially are obsessed with this image of Russia being a world power, an image which does not align with the fact that for the last 20 years Russia's economy has been declining, its population has been shrinking. It is now poorer than Canada by GDP gross and per capita. It is a country that has pretensions on the world stage that simply are not matched by its capabilities. And yet its populace and its politicians are not aligned to this fact. And what, as history tells us, is the easy solution to a mismatch of foreign policy conceptions and reality. It is war. It is more territory. It is grandeur. It is celebration. This is why Putin, for his own self-delusions of grandeur and his own security, as president for life has to do this, or at least thinks he has to do this. Now, why does this matter? War has been declared. Why do we need to understand that Russia is delusional in its approach to its foreign policy? Well, because we cannot hope for a peaceful situation in the short term, let alone in the long term, until we understand the Russian psyche. Russia is posing up to China, not because they are ideologically similar, not because they have similar interests for the future of the international. national relations, but because Russia sees that if it aligned itself in the short term with China, it can continue to be relevant. It continue to have some plea for power and authority on the world stage. This conflict is something that I did not expect would happen over the last few months, and something that my best friend who's from Kiev did not think would happen. I think it has taken the West by surprise entirely. And yet unlike the times that Russia has acted in the past, in 2008, unlike in 2014, the West has up to its game. A Western Europe that has been had dwindling defense budgets for 30 or 40 years, with ever-shinking armies and pathetic capabilities in the sea and in the air, has finally woken up to the fact that democracy, liberty and security are things that we have to secure years in advance. This crisis could have been avoided. It could have been avoided by being more clear to Russia at what our intentions were, about inviting Eastern European states into NATO. It could have been avoided by increased economic cooperation with the Russian Federation in the 1990s. By the time we get to 2008, this crisis is inevitable. And the only way to solve it is for the West to show a united front, for the EU and NATO to not shirk their military commitments, not shirk their foreign policy commitments to those in Eastern Europe with whom we share values. The irony of this situation is that Ukraine and the country, 2014 was not a united country, or prior to 2014, was not a united country. It did not really have the sense of identity and national spirit that does today. By taking Crimea and by intervening in elections, Putin othered Russia to Ukraine, rather than being two countries culturally joined, as the Hon. Remember from Mexico College said earlier, by seven, 800 years of history. He forced a situation where the Ukrainian Orthodox Church split from the Russian Orchian Orthodox Church split from the Russian Orthodox Church, ending a thousand-year-old tradition. This represents the fact that Ukraine is no longer just a former Soviet Republic. It is, over the last eight years, a new country with a newfound identity that is defined in part in its opposition to Russia. We in the West, who since the First World War, have defined ourselves by the principle that self-determination is central to the rules-based world order must do as much as we can to support that, to ensure that breaches of self-determination are not accepted, regardless of the cost, personal or economic, to wealthy and privileged citizens in the West. So I ask you all, understand Russia, judge Russia, but most of all, act in your daily lives in a way that recognizes that the things we live by are not to be taken for granted. for us, for our friends in France or Canada or America, and not for those in Eastern Europe either. Thank you very much.
