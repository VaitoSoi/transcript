 Ladies and gentlemen, I must confess I am not an economist. I will not be drawing some fancy economic diagrams or models or use some pretentious economic abbreviations to give credibility to my speech. Instead, I will resolve to common sense to logic, to precedence, and to facts. The burden is indeed on us tonight to convince you all that Western lenders are, for the large part, responsible and blameworthy, for the plight of developing country. To carry this burden on side proposition, all we have to do is to show that Western lenders are one of the reasons, perhaps one of the bigger reasons, but not that it is the sole reason. The opposition will try to argue that, oh, there are many things to be blamed such as corruption, government incompetence, conservatism, etc. If they do so, they're barking up the wrong tree. Even if they show a dozen other people are blameworthy, it doesn't prove that Western lenders aren't. Every breath you spend tonight showing that something else caused it is a breath wasted. Don't let them fool you all. They will also give examples tonight of one or two particular countries where they'll argue that Western lenders actually helped. But that is not their burden tonight, ladies and gentlemen. Their burden is to prove that Western lenders are not at all blameworthy for the plight of developing countries. Or in the least, that Western lenders do not harm if they don't do any good. So to convince you tonight that the proposition has every right to blame the Western lenders, I will be making two main points. Firstly, that the very nature and structure of Western lending is inherently exploitative and flawed, whether it is the IMF or private lenders from the West. Secondly, that Western lending is nothing more than Western neocolonialism, a way for Western powers to gain influence. over developing countries, over struggling economies, be it at the cost of worsening poverty, increasing unemployment, and making the poor poorer. In essence, I'll argue tonight that in an ideal world, lending to struggling economies would be a very pious act, something that should be praised, but unfortunately the way it is in our world today, the way Western lending works in today's world, is inherently flawed, exploitative, and has caused the developing economic economies more damage than it has done good. But before I get into my points, the responsibility falls on me, of course, to introduce the speakers inside opposition. Opening the case for opposition, you will hear from Iman Saeed, a second-year lawyer and a present sponsorship officer at the Oxford Union. I'm expecting big things from Iman, by the way, because she's had thorough treatment. She's had a lot of training in international relations and diplomacy through the infamous model United Nations. Having said that, I do hope tonight that her speech will be more successful than her election campaign last year this time. Second, you'll hear from Amy Gilbright, a secondary classic student at Regent Spar College, and an elected member of Standing Secretary's Committee. I must say that I am very surprised to see Amy Gilbride speaking in opposition of this motion. I thought she knew a lot about the plight of struggling institution. After all, she studies at Regent Park College. So while I can't agree with you tonight, I do offer my sincerest condolences. Lastly, you'll hear from Teney Rao. Teney Rao is a third-year PPS at St. Anne's College and an ex-CDSC at the Union. Tenae is known on the Union's competitive debating committee as a cost-cutting warrior for austerity, forcing the poor debaters to take 16 pounds bus instead of a 20-pound strain to cut the costs. I'm not surprised at all that he is trying to export his model of financial management to the developing world now. Dene also actually really, really loves economics. The last time I saw him in Plush, believe it or not, he was reading The Economist. I look forward to the flowery economic diagrams that you will draw for us tonight. Mr. Chair, these are our guests and they're most welcome. The debate tonight is titled neocolonialism. Neocolonialism itself is defined as economic imperialism and conditional aid or lending to influence or control developing countries instead of the previous colonial methods of direct military control. Now, neocolonism typically results in a relationship of dependence, in a relationship of subservience, in a relationship of financial obligation towards the neo-colonialist nation, functionally imitating the relationship of colonialism. Now bear that in mind, and throughout the speech and throughout the debate, you'll realize and you'll see clearly that this is exactly what seems to be the incentives for the very generous Western lenders. Now, moving on to my first point for tonight, on the inherent exploitative natures and the flawed conditions of Western lenders. I shall first divide the Western lenders into two categories. The IMF and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization, etc., which the opposition will make out to be some really virtuous, pious organizations. And secondly, the private Western lenders, like banks and corporations, which even the opposition will struggle to defend, I believe. Starting with the elephant in the room, that is the IMF and the World Bank, the two big institutions, the world's leading lending institutions, which together have 749 billions in funds. But let's see who controls these funds, these sums of funds. Voting rights in both institutions, in both of the IMF and World Bank, are allocated according to the capital contributed. As a result, already wealthy nations have more voting rights. So the USA, for instance, has 20% voting rights in the IMF and the World Bank. Now, in contrast, all 47 sub-Saharan African countries have only 7% of the voting rights altogether. Now, this gives developed countries like the US and European Union and the European countries the power to make lending decisions and set unfavorable conditions for their own benefit. And that is exactly what they do. That is exactly what they're doing today. Now you might think yourself, hey, why didn't developing countries just say no if they're such unfavorable conditions? Remember, however, that a lot of these countries are very recently independent and are still reeling from centuries of colonial oppression. Choice and time are luxuries that these countries can simply not afford. So developing countries accept these loans that they so desperately need, and at an extortionate interest rates and come back into a new system of oppression, albeit this time economic. Now, many of IMF's conditions that are outlined for lending, such as fiscal austerity, high interest rates, trade liberalization, privatization, open capital markets have all often been counterproductive for target economies and devastating for the populations, for the local populations of those countries. A study of 81 developing countries from 1986 to 2016 found that IMF loans arrangements contribute to more people getting trapped in the poverty cycle. The study showed that developing countries borrowing from the IMF experienced higher rates of poverty than those developing countries who had some sense and avoided this trap. The problem is that these policies can make the already difficult economic situations way worse. For example, let's look at the Asian crisis of 1997. Indonesia and Malaysia and Thailand were forced by the IMF to pursue tight monetary and fiscal policies to reduce the budget deficit. However, these policies caused a serious recession with very high levels of unemployment, once again, affecting the local population of these countries. In 2001, Argentina was forced into a similar policy of fiscal restraint, thus led to a decline in investment in public services, which led to a downfall of the Argentine economy. Now, the policies of the World Bank, the IMF, and the World Trade Organization are further making the gap between the wealthy countries and the struggling countries wider. Through these lending organizations like IMF and the World Bank, what the West has achieved is the economic colonization of developing countries. This gives them more access to exploit these nations and further advance themselves. Now, take an example of a country like Ghana, for example. There used to be some prosperous rice farming communities in the northern parts of Ghana. In fact, the government of Ghana used to give those farmers support, to enable them to produce on a larger scale so that they can feed the nation. However, the IMF and the World Bank came along and forced the Ghanaian government to cut the farming subsidies. All just to force Ghana into importing rice from the partner Western countries such as the United States and the European Union. When Ghana increased its import duties from 20% to 40% in response to this, they were forced by the IMF to reverse the US. to reverse this law. In other words, if you don't obey what the World Bank and the IMF say, then you must pay back the debt. And if you can't pay back the debt, then you must do whatever you're asked to do. Private lenders are no better. In November 2020, private creditors rejected the Zambian government's request for a six-month standstill on debt payments. This was at a time when Zambia was fighting COVID crisis. As a result, Zambia became the first country, the first African country to default on its debt at the start of the pandemic. Zambia is spending four times more on debt repayments than it is on public health care. That is outrageous. Many private creditors made a lot of huge profits during the pandemic from developing countries' debt, leaving developing countries to use their scarce resources all they have left on debt repayment as opposed to responding to the pandemic. Now, moving on to briefly my second point, which is sort of looping it all in together, about the Western lending as a way of colonization by the West in the modern day. Now, colonization today, my friends, is different to what it was about 100 years ago. It is not the same. It's more subtle now. Now, these countries' Western powers have restored to economic influence to gain a same sort of control over these developing and social. struggling economies. And you know what is the worst part about all of this is that it's guised as a gracious act. It is shown as Western nations saving the developing countries. This narrative has been shamelessly sold through institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. It is honestly ridiculous to even hear these sort of things. The opposition tonight will accuse us of being against the idea of lending or Western lending in total. They would be mistaken. The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding Western lenders from operating in less developed countries at all, but at preventing financial powers of the developed countries being used in a way to impoverish and exploit the less developed countries. Now for too long, we have seen the dominance of the West and their subsequent abuse of power to keep themselves at the top and subjugate the poorer countries. It is finally time that we realize that Western lenders in today's world do not lend because they care about these countries. There is no such incentive for them. They don't give a flying shit about any of these countries. Their incentive is solely to advance themselves and to have influence and control over these countries exactly like it worked under colonialism. Now this, ladies and gentlemen, is the tragic story of today's world where developing countries are suffering the cost of Western greed. A heartbreaking reality is unfolding in front of us. We know exactly who to blame. We know exactly why we're blaming them. And that is why I would like to propose this motion tonight. Thank you. I congratulate chair, that to the president.
