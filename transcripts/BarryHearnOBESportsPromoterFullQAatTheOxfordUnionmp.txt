 So Mr Hearn, what was your, the start of the beginning, what was your childhood like, and how do you think it led to your career in sports? I'm not sure it led to my career in sports. My childhood was very family orientated. Obviously my father was a bus driver and my mother cleaned houses. So we were very working class. I think I remain working class proudly to this day but it was a childhood of happiness nothing significant really to report on until you get to the age of looking around at the rest of the world and in my case wondering why we didn't have certain things that other people had and and that installed a sense of entrepreneurship inside me that said I would like to get a house with an indoor toilet or would like to get a car or such like but it was very standard very normal I can't say I suffered I didn't know anything better I've always loved sport I've always wanted to be a great sportsman and never actually achieved it but my dream when I was growing up was to be heavyweight champion in the world until I found out I couldn't fight very well and that was a bit of a career setback but my mother was I think she was a working-class snob she wanted the very best for her children. So she pushed very hard, so she pushed me into things like elocution lessons, which as you can see haven't worked. She pushed me into amateur dramatic society versus appreciation society, which at the time was very tedious, but looking back on it, it probably gave me the ability to promote, to project myself and to have the confidence in my own ability. So childhood was fun. We came from born in Dagenham in the East End of London, moved out to Debden to a council estate there for about 16 years and progressed through grammar school. Unfortunately in these wonderful surroundings, never quite made university. Couldn't find one that had happened me and in those days it was more important to go and get a job. Did you play much sports? You mentioned fighting, did you do much boxing? I did a little. No, my boxing really didn't start until I was about 27. I was too busy trying to make a living. I was a big fan, but once I got my O levels and my A levels, I went into Article Clark ship for training as a chartered accountant, and that was all consuming for four years. And we get onto this merry-go round of life where you want to be successful. I was no genius. I wasn't the brightest bulb in the room. but my bulb lasted a bit longer than most others. I had a great work ethic without necessarily the skill set to back it up. But the work ethic made up for it. And as I say, the priority for much of my earlier life was just playing sport, every form of athletics from the pole vault through to the 400 metres, to the shot put through, well, just everything. And I never won any of them. I nearly won the one-mile sprint walk, but disqualified on the line when winning the county championships for lifting. I'm never forgiven that judge, but there we are. We'll come back on that. Is there a particular sporting memory, either watching or participating from your childhood, that stands out? I think you learn a lot of lessons in sport, because I've always run my business as if I'm in sport. I play to win. hopefully within the rules but that's hopefully not necessarily all the time because I want to win so I'm very focused on everything I do and if I set my targets I'm very difficult to budge I know that I suppose that either a strength or a weakness but I'm very dedicated to my plan of action so when I took at standing out and sporting sense the sprint walk keeps coming back to me because I'd come second and third absolutely every discipline and then one year I looked on the chart outside the gym and there was an empty space for names next to the one-mile sprint walk and it was like the road to Damascus I suddenly had this flash of inspiration I can win something I thought I could win it because there was no one else in it but anyway I put my name down and I was accepted and then I did what I do best I I trained diligently every day. I built up my calf muscles, I built up my speed, my wiggle was something to behold on a summer's day. And came the first one, the divisional championships. I didn't know what to expect. I was ready, I was prepared, and I won by over 400 yards. So I thought, this was damn good. Came to the South Essex Championships and I won by 300 yards. And this is where I looked at. one of my first lessons in life is complacency is a killer because I came to the Essex Championships which obviously if you won that you went through to the Nationals etc and as we were warming up I was asking these young kids was we're all kids what's your best time what's your best time and they said eight minutes and eight seconds eight minutes and 20 eight minutes 12 my best time was seven minutes 35 If I'd have been a racehorse, I was a shoe in. It was impossible for me to get beat. And the dreaded complacency came into play. So fast track to the beginning of the race, I didn't set off with my normal speed because I felt I had so much in hand. And a little ginger-haired chap went to the front and I wasn't really bothered because I had 30 or 40 seconds on him. But when we went round to the last lap, he was still in front. And panic replaced his complacent. And eventually I panicked enough to accelerate to the extent that I was disqualified for lifting And two lessons I learned one is complacency is a killer But the best lesson was winning is everything and actually coming second is not appealing to me And I've had that attitude through my life ever since. Do you still sprint walk? I ran marathons all around the world. I did a some mini triathlons around the world. I've always kept myself in some sort of physical shape, but today, regretfully, at 74 years of age, I'm rather limited to a small piece of gym work, and I still play county cricket for Essex over 70s, which I enjoy enormously, but it generally results in the fact that I can't walk for three or four days after bowling eight overs. But do you no longer apply the wiggle and... The wig is actually, that's been transferred to the deposit in my head of a youthful athlete. And today I have no pretensions of that. I'm in awe of anyone with ability. I always have been. I've probably in awe is one word. Jealous may well be another. But I've learned to live with it. And I've learned to accept that certain things I can do better than most. And some things I am shamelessly way behind the marker. So, yeah, what you can't beat me on is enthusiasm. Unfortunately, there is no gold medal for enthusiasm. So you said that you sort of started becoming really involved and obsessed with sport in your 20s and boxing, you're 27. And it seems that you sort of became involved with sports through business. Which do you think has driven your career more? Your passion for sports or your desire for business and career? The two go hand in hand if you want to be the best at it. I mean, if you go into any business just to make money, there's something missing. You need that passion to drive you because, again, whether it's complacency or whether you just settle for a certain level of expertise, when you're a sportsman, you don't know how good you're going to be, but you're prepared to make sacrifices and to dedicate your life to it. When you're a businessman, you don't know how much money you're going to make or lose necessarily because perhaps of outside factors even. But nevertheless, you can set yourself targets and you work diligently to achieve those targets. What you need to have is the focus and the refusal to accept anything best, anything worse than the best you can be. So all you ever ask yourself in sport or in businesses to be the best you can be. and then whether you're religious and say God will supply the answer to how successful you are or whether you say fate will deploy its assets as it sees fit. But nevertheless for me, the passion for a sport which I maintain, there are certain sports that I won't promote because I know I have no passion for that sport. And there may be sports like I don't particularly like motorsport. I don't particularly like tennis. So I don't promote those sports. Because, well, it's just the truth. You see, you can bullshit other people, but you mustn't bullshit yourself. And you know if you've got to go the extra mile, if you've got to make an extra bit of sacrifice, it gets tougher, especially if you're successful elsewhere. Your success is limited only by your own imagination. But if your imagination doesn't exist and you feel no passion for it, then you're just going through the motions. And you're doing it for the wrong reasons. Now, if it works, the other side of it, is if you are passionate about a sport, and if you do really love a sport, and you love a successful business, then that can all gel nicely. And in the case of my company, Matrim, I mean, 40 years ago, next week, we launched Matron, a Â£100 company underneath a billionaire in Brought in Essex with me and a girl and a part-time bookkeeper. And today it's the biggest or one of the biggest sports promotion companies in the world And it's been built on the principle of passion hard work Dedication and sacrifice and it's been a joy of a journey When juggling that sort of list of sports I read out at the start Have you found that there have been times where you've been bored of working with one because you're much more invested in another? There have been times when that list is the list as of for today but there has been times when we've done sports that have not worked out where we have felt that our passion hasn't been enough and although i like to take the credit for being the best in the world of what i do the reality is sometimes even if you are the best promoter in the world there'll be things that just can't work because of circumstances outside of your control so i used to do shooting for example i did a thing called the the game ball white Gold Cup, which was a very big shooting event, but it became unfashionable to show shooting events at that time on TV. It disappeared. And we look at other sports. I did gymnastics for the World Cup of gymnastics and then the superstar of gymnastics, but I became disenchanted, is a very kind way of saying, with the governing bodies and the bureaucracy that was involved. So we passed on that for the moment. We may return. It is a question of evaluating what you want. There is only 24 hours in each day. So you have to be quite careful about what you allocate your time to. Because we have such a successful global reputation, we are constantly approached by other sports to say, would you take us over? The quote is, do what you've done for darts. It doesn't work like that. Darts is a one-off sport. It doesn't necessarily apply elsewhere. But at the same time, I can understand people want more commercialisation. of this sport and we are experts at providing that commercialisation. Nevertheless, you still have to have that desire. I have 750 event days this year. I will not go to all of them, but I'd love to go to all of them if I could. And while that candle burns brightly, then I know I'm going in the right direction. Is there one particular event that you've promoted or facilitated that stands out as a high point? I think the weirdest event, and in a way a high point because no one believes it is Fishermania, the quest to find the king of the water, which was an idea I had in 1990 when Sky launched, and I went to see Sky to pitch, you should put fishing on Sky television. And it didn't go down very well that suggestion. In fact, the head of sport, David Hill, described it as filming maggots being drowned, which wasn't the greatest start I had to a conversation. But I told him that more people go fishing on a weekend than watch professional football. And that got his attention because it's true. It is a huge sport, but no one had ever given it the respect to treat it properly, or to create heroes out of ordinary working class people that were specialists in the field of angling. He suggested that we consider doing, half an hour shows to which I replied, no, I want to do this properly. And I suggest we do six hours live on the Saturday before the football season starts. And the head of sky nearly had a heart attack and said, that's enough to cost me my job. And I questioned why are we in this business to start with? Are we here to do something different? Or are we here to do what everybody's done for years and years. And for me, I want to do things that are different. And I won him round and we put Fishermania on Sky for six hours live on the last Saturday before the football season started. And everyone said, this is a one-off and it will never happen again. And this July is the 30th year of Fishermania, the biggest fishing competition in the world. And I rest my case. That's fantastic A fantastic story And I suppose It's prompted the popularity Lots of other fishing shows Like Deadliest Catch Of course Of course If there's a market For something We all aim to hit a target market Some target markets Maybe students Some target markets Maybe old age pensioners Doesn't matter As long as you are pitching your product To the right market You have a chance to succeed If you're wasting your time Years ago when I was working in other businesses, I remember working in Japan quite a lot. And the company that produced Kellogg's Corn Flakes went to Japan and spent millions of dollars advertising Kellogg's Corn Flakes before someone realized that there wasn't very much milk in Japan. They hadn't done their research. They hadn't looked at their target market. And after, and people were eating Kellogg's cool face like crisps, straight out of the packet. Now that's inexcusable for professional people to act like that. And for me what I always do is I look, the first question I ask is, what's my market? Where am I trying to pitch this sport? What level? And some sports are A1 sports, you know, the affluent, the privileged classes you may say, some sports are blue collar sports for working class. And then there's a sport called. And then there's a sport called football, which has no rules and applies to everybody and is 10 times bigger than anything else anyway. So, you know, but it's important to just exercise common sense. That's all it is. It's not rocket science. You don't have to be a genius to do what I do, but you have to just think it through rationally. Across the time you've been working as a sports promoter, what have been the biggest changes you've noticed in how sport operates? It's been through technology, increased professionalisation, more money, the world becoming overall, more competitive. Well, you've hit boat most of them there. I mean, when I started, my first sports event was 1975. I mean, there, you know, there was no digital networks. There was no satellite and cable. That was, there was beginnings of it in America with ESPN. All of a sudden we had Sky, BT, Eurosport. And there was suddenly this animal in the room saying, feed me. Because there were no events. So obviously during the 80s, while I was waiting for this explosion, I started producing events to fulfil a demand that was going to inevitably happen. I was probably a couple of years too early, so I lost many millions of pounds in the process. But I got it back later on in case you're worried about me. Don't worry. I'm okay. So the biggest thing, I think obviously Sky coming to England as the first forerunner of this new wave of. of television technology was fundamental to the success of my business and sport in general. Subsequently, social media has made a huge, had a huge effect on growing the personalities and the awareness of sport and the monetisation of that sport. The money, most things in life come down to money. We don't like to admit it. We have a Saudi golf tour at the moment where everyone's trying to make a good excuse for playing in the Saudi golf tour instead of telling the truth, which is there's a lot of money here for me and my family just tell the truth because everyone knows and there's nothing wrong with that. Even in our business, Anthony Joshua's next fight will be in Saudi Arabia and the reason is because they're paying five times more money than anybody else. So, you know, I think it's better to be honest with people and they'll appreciate that. They may not agree with you, but in that circumstance, understand why our job is to put opportunities in front of people and the talent makes takes control really and makes the final decision so for me I think social media has made a big difference digitalization of technology has been huge there's a different attitude amongst people as well I think people need to be entertained through sport sport has become much more personality led probably less personalities but bigger personalities of those that remain. And it is led to be entertainment. You know, people want value for money. They're quite happy to support in huge numbers, but they need to be entertained. So you have to tell a story. It's not just a question of saying, and here is a sports event. Within that sports event, there has to be storylines. There has to be backstories. That's to be, you have to educate them to the people they're about to cheer or boo. And you have to create those people into soap opera stars, really. Now, we're not talking about Love Island here. We're talking about sport. But a lot of the principles still apply. So they have to handle themselves right. They have to be inspirational to other people to follow in their footsteps. And they have to be technically gifted and qualified to produce the finest level of sporting entertainment possible. And that means they have to be world class. But when they do that, their life changes and sport as a medium changes people's lives as much as much, or dare I say it, more so even than a great education. Time will tell whether that's the case. One criticism that's frequently leveled against the professionalisation of sports and the need for sports starts to be phenomenal is that it adds more more barriers to sports. I know the two sports you mentioned you don't like, but for example, in F1 or tennis, unless you've been playing since you were four or five, you're never going to be the next Roger Federal or the next Lewis Hamilton. Do you think that this over-professionalisation of sport, I don't know if you see it in the sports you work in, has had a negative impact on? I think I've always, I'm not sure I agree that it's getting worse. I think it's getting better. I've always been completely opposed barriers to entry. Probably because I have a chip on my shoulder, about my own personal background, you know. There were things that I didn't get the opportunities for, or in the areas we lived, there weren't the facilities to take advantage, or there was no family money, no private schools, etc, etc. So other than football, which you always take out of the equation, because it's a... That's the elephant in the room, if you like. football just makes its own rules. But elsewhere there are barriers to entry and those barriers to entry will have a serious effect on those sports over the next 10 years as youngsters today or young sportsmen and women find other things to occupy themselves if the barrier is insurmountable. So the sports that I think are going to be under a lot of pressure in the next 10 years will be tennis, golf, cricket simply because you have to practice those and you have to have facilities and time and today's when you look at your target audience I don't see other than with parental encouragement or school encouragement that so many people going forward will participate which means we as a nation become more of a spectator audience than a participation audience so sports like darts which obviously I'm heavily involved of so super biased on as well, represents a clear pathway with the opportunity and the structure of the sport for ordinary people with little or no cost to participate in. And that may prove to be the next, I mean, it's growing at a huge rate around the world, but particularly in Europe, where we are seeing colossal numbers from six years old, playing darts in their bedroom, in their garage, getting the first taste. And then you create. structures behind that so there's a junior darts corporation from 6 to 16 there's a developmental tour from 16 to 25 you can train to go to Q score as in golf to get your professional card so once that structure's in place then the job then is to take away the barriers to entry so no expensive equipment no expensive club to join no expensive entry fees nothing which stops a normal kid from the background that I was brought up in having their chance. My job, our job, is to give them the opportunity. The dedication, the sacrifice comes from the player. And if they're prepared to make it, they deserve their chance. And if they're not, I always tell them to get another job. You mentioned that, I know you said your cricket player earlier, and you mentioned the need of sports like cricket and tennis and golf to modernise, change their own, reduce barriers to entry. Just a quick question that I'm personally curious on. What are your thoughts on the 100? I like innovation. And I think it's going to take some time. Cricket had a big problem in the fact that the county scene was struggling to. And I probably would have done it an entirely different way myself. But the powers that be decided to virtually give up on that. You know, I think there was another way. You know, I'm a great believer in crowds make atmosphere. I mean, one of the sadnesses of my life, and there haven't been very many, was that I didn't invent 2020 cricket, because it's got my hand writing all over. Cricket goes to the darts, if you like, Friday night, what a great. Everyone's got a smile in their face, everyone's having a good time, which is what what in sports should be about. And it's changed the basis of cricket in this country, because people are much more attacking batsmen now than they used to be. in my days of growing up with Jeffrey Boycott and people like that, that they didn't make 100 before lunch, and sometimes didn't make 100 in two days. So the entertainment factor is really, really important, much more now than it's ever been, because you are in conflict with various other activities, whether you go to the cinema or you go to a restaurant. And the casual fan is the most important asset we all have. The traditional fan is only 5%, 95% is making a choice. to go. So therefore you have to make it something special for them. But I think, you know, there are also some very successful, good success stories out there. You know, Darts is one of them, but you know I'm looking at certain other sports. Again, if I look at gymnastics amongst a younger crowd, the data we get in says that every single gymnastics club is full up with a huge waiting list. So that's something that you turn your attention to in time. Recently you published your autobiography and I believe you have some copies of it to be signed after this event. How have you found the process of writing it and going over your life reflecting on how far you've come and what you've done? Do you know, I would never have done it in the first place, but my daughter, five years ago had twin boys and said to me about a year after their birth, you have to write your autobiography. I've always been dominated by strong-minded women. My mother, my wife, my daughter all basically control me. But she wanted something written down so that her two boys could understand where I came from, where we as a family came from, and the journey we'd been on. So I understood that. It ended up, it took me three and a half years to write. Every time I went fishing, which I do quite a lot of fishing because it relaxes me, I would take a microphone and talk stories and memories, give the tape to my PA, she would type it out. And then I had a very good friend of mine called Nick Pitt, who worked 30 years for Sunday Times, who put it into some sort of comprehensible order, thank goodness. Looking back on it now, in a reflective mode, I'm really glad I did it. Because it, I mean, it can never be perfect, your life story. but it has to be truthful I was really waiting for three or four more people to die before it was ready to be written and as luck would have it a couple of them did so that removed that meant some of the stories could actually be told someone said to me very rarely does a dead person sue you but I've tried to keep it as accurate and to sort of put out the fun that I've had and I don't believe I've ever had a bad day. I've had times where things didn't go right, but I've always felt blessed to be in the sports business and to be doing something that didn't feel like I was going to work. And I've been like that from day one, really. So I was fortunate having been a failed athlete myself in so many different ways, it gave me a slightly different perspective on life and on the business side of sport. And I think that ended up being a huge advantage. I mean, boxing is a really good example. I was absolutely dreadful. You know, I don't think it was anybody. Well, there was one guy in the gym that I could beat up regularly. Everyone else used to beat me up. But you learn lessons. You learn about yourself. And you learn about the character you have. And it's easy to say, you know, when you get knocked down, do you get up? But you transfer what you learn in that ring into, even at my very poor standard, into a business sense, it replicates everything you go through. You will have bad days. Do you get up? You do have to compete every single hour of your life. Are you prepared? Have you put the hours in? Are you dedicated enough? Or are you just some spoiled person with no character? Are you relentless? Are you prepared to do anything to win? It's easy to say those words. Look in the mirror and you'll ask yourself that question one day. It's a fun answer you get back sometimes. But you enjoyed the process? Proud of your product? I loved it. And I'm proud of the book because it sets out, I think, fairly, the ups and downs of somehow how I flew to an amazing business, obviously huge amounts of money, and how I learned that it doesn't really matter as long as you win. Was your daughter and your grandchildren pleased with the... Good question. I don't think my wife is going to ever read this book. She was very instrumental and I said I needed a couple of pictures in her. You wanted to pick the right pictures. But I think it's it's something that's very personal to you when you actually, you know, I must have read this, but when it was finally, I must have read it 12 times making changes. And in all honesty, if I read it 12 more times, I'd have made 12 more sets of changes. So am I pleased with it? I'm led by other people's comments. They're much more. I'm more interested in have other people are happy with them, do they think it's fair and accurate? And hopefully some of the lessons inside it make them a better person or a better business person, certainly, when they get into the real world. Now, a slightly tougher question, I suppose. You had a friendship for a number of years with Geoffrey Epstein. No. A relationship with... No, not in the slightest. It's interesting that. I think you've picked that up from social media. I went to a dinner party at Gilane's Maxwell's house because I knew her father quite well. My wife and I went and apparently Epstein was in the room but I never actually spoke to him. Interestingly enough, where this all comes from is he was apparently an avid collector of contact details and in his published book which I believe had something like 14,000 names and addresses, in, there was a line that said Barry and Susan Hearn with my phone number. And that is the extent I'm afraid of my relationship with Mr. Epstein. Or rather I should say, I'm rather pleased that that is the extent of my relationship. But at the time, of course, you know, I knew Gillane Maxwell, I think I knew most of the Maxwell's. I knew both her brothers. They were published in a newspaper called The Euro. at the time, we did quite a lot of work with them. Obviously, the old man was a character and a half, but he was, I think he was at the time caught in Miss Maxwell. And I don't recall if I ever actually spoke to him at all, but he was apparently in the building. Have you found that your sort of celebrity state as a result of being a promoter has led to things like this happening and people... There's always, there's always, people, people, There's always people sort of, I mean I think sport, particularly boxing, draws in some strange people from time to time, as you'd imagine. It's predominantly a working class sport and people from working class areas tend to support the local kids that go on, whether they're playing for Manchester United or whether they're boxing at Goodison Park, Everton Park Sports Centre or something like that. So you've always got a good cross-section of character. directors and I've always taken them to be, well they're, I think they're entitled to come to a show, to buy a ticket and enjoy themselves. As long as they're not a problem to me, I definitely won't be a problem to them, is the attitude I've always taken. But, you know, as I say, things like the Epstein stuff, it's quite interested on social media because there's always a few trolls get onto things on social media. Yeah, you and your mate Epstein and like, are you sure, you know? But, no, I think you've always, but you've met them. If you go back in time, I was in Lord Boothroyd had a great relationship with the Cray brothers. And a lot of famous Tory grande, if you like, seem to enjoy the company of gangsters like that, you know. I'm not saying I'd recommend that. But it was entirely different to their life. And sometimes people found that, you know, attractive. One or two more questions for me before we opened up to questions from the audience. But are there any sports you've really wanted to get involved with but never have? Well, as I said, I would have got involved with cricket. Years ago, I put some idea to the Testin County Cricket Board. I wanted to do an indoor World Cup. So my idea was to take Alexandria, not exactly, Olympia, the Grand Hall there, and actually put a net at, net the entire audience. So you're standing behind nets. and play an indoor World Cup, which I thought was a great idea at the time. But I think it was a little bit early for the authorities. They weren't. I don't blame them, but a lot of people sit when I'm, if I start knocking on the door, they get a little bit nervous. Because you see, I'm a, I describe myself a little bit more as a benevolent despot. I'm not, I'm not a committee member. I have a clear plan in my mind mapped out before I go into everything. That's the chartered accountant in me. if you like, I'm organised, but I'm also a control freak. So the downsides, I don't take other people's criticism well. I'm getting better at listening, especially I realize I have to listen to younger people because they have much more understanding of new technology than I could have. My nine-year-old granddaughter knows more about how to operate the benefits of an iPhone than I ever will. But what you do is you tend to, I need, I have such a clear vision. when I want to do something, I just need to be let loose and I can be very dangerous. But I'm not necessarily welcomed by existing authority that would view me with terror because they know the first thing I will probably do is get rid of them because they're not very good. So most of the IOC departments in sport that I've seen love their sport but don't give enough attention to changing the lives of sportsmen and women. And that is a huge downside because I can't ask someone to sacrifice themselves unless I'm prepared to pay to watch that sacrifice. And I'm very money-orientated. This is part of the level playing field. I believe in a meritocracy. And I don't like barriers to entry because it's no longer a meritocracy. And you'll never get it completely right, but you can take away a lot. by giving opportunity. But as I say, I'm also cognizant of the fact that I'm not the easiest person to work with. You know, so live with it. What else are you going to do? So it'd be cricket, the one sport you wish you'd done more. Cricket, yeah, I would have liked to have done something on cricket because I'm passionate about the sport. And as I say, I still play it badly at my age, although my fielding is appalling. But I love it. And, you know, I admire excellence in the world. any sport, but it's what's the one that sets your pulse? Where do you get excited when you know, oh, I'm going somewhere in a day or two days or three days? That's the difference between do I want to be involved or not, and you mustn't, in life, you mustn't go through the motions. If it's such a short time here, you've got to make every hour count, and that means that you've got to be very serious. We don't want to end up like one of those people we describe as fur coat no knickers you know they look nice but they have no substance that doesn't work for me I'm conscious of time so if there any questions from audience members please raise your hand or membership card and one of our team will bring you a microphone please stand up and ask the question thanks for coming so I think it's fair to say that you kind of revolutionise snooker but where do you see the future of snooker being now obviously you know, Ron is just won his seventh world title. Who do you see kind of challenging him and how do you see kind of more young people coming in and yeah, kind of taking that class of 92 to the wire? Well, it's a fascinating situation in Snooker with the class of 92. And you start asking a question about sport in general. Why? You know, where is this secret rule that says when you get old, you can't be any good anymore. And that exists, that thinking exists in a lot of sport and sometimes it's mind over matter. Well, the class of 92 has decided, no, we're going to carry on winning. I think, what did they win? Probably half the events last year and the year before. We are beginning to see what people have been predicting for some time as a Chinese invasion of snooker. Going back five, six, seven years, that's been talked about. But I think people underestimate how difficult it is for some of the Chinese players to adapt to living in England, adjusting to a different life, not seeing their family, etc., etc. And that impinges on their own ability to play. But this year we saw the emergence of two or three highly talented players, Yang Bintow, in particular, Zhu Yulong. These guys are going to be around, and I think they've now learned, they've learned their lesson of where they're. they're ready to go. I believe that they will be the next main challenges. I think Judd Trump and Jack Lizoski, people like that are good enough to challenge them as well. Sooner or later, you'd like to think father time have challenged them, wouldn't you? But Ronnie is such an exceptional talent in any sport someone comes along. And you know, it's not bad for the sport to have someone like that as a role model, as a flag bearer, a brilliant player, personality driven, crazy as a coot sometimes as well, but you can't take your eye off him and that's the secret of what sport you want. There are some younger players from Europe coming on. I see young Ben Merton's got his tour card from Belgium, 17 years old, there's some quality players coming through, one or two from England as well, in fact four or five from Wales. Young Reese Davis, I think he's 17 or something. You know, he's another outstanding prospect. But they take time to adjust because it's a brutal game. And it is not a game where, as some people would have it, people go into different structures. They're like golf. They all go in on day one. So if you have some bad drawers, you can draw, Monio Sullivan, followed by Mark Williams, followed by John Higgins, followed by Judd Trump, followed by Neil Robertson. and you think that's a hell of a learning curve, isn't it? But it's brutal sport because sport has to be brutal now. You have to pay your price if you want the returns that you get. So it's not a question of being good. You have to be exceptional. The class of 92 has been exceptional. One would imagine that farther time is the only thing that's going to beat them one day. There's an interesting sort of question raised there, I suppose, the nature of sport in general. It's not just in snooker, but if you look at Ronaldo and football or the great tennis legends. Federer, you know, Nadal still winning, Jocovic. I mean, there are three guys have dominated tennis and the fourth one is, you know, Andy Murray that's just coming back after long's injury. And I think that the problem we have as promoters is to make sure that these people have become famous. There's actually no point in sport being good if you're not famous. You don't ever make the money. And again, I'm totally money-orientated. You know, I'm not a Corinthian in case that I escaped anyone's notice. It's all about changing your life, providing for your family, creating a lifestyle, inspiring other people to follow in your footsteps. And to do that, you need to be famous. And you can either spend a long time building up slow, or you can get good promotion around you that you'll build your profile much quicker in darts for example when we started off with darts like okay what do we do well first thing is we're going to admit the ordinary nature of the darts player they are ordinary very ordinary people but with extraordinary ability so we concentrate on that which is a question of averages checkouts one 80s nine dart finishes all of that sort of stuff now let's build the personality make sure everyone's got a nickname make sure they've got entry music Make sure they know what to say in front of camera, give them media lessons. And this is a process that goes through sport. And, you know, sometimes they're very difficult. You know, a lot of people say there's no characters in snooker like there used to be. Well, there are, but people don't spend enough time developing that character because they're so concentrating on becoming a winning machine. So the snooker side at the moment, the standard of play is far better than it's ever been. And yet the class of 92 are still winning. Interesting. So with the age thing and the importance of celebrity in sport now, do you think there is a problem caused by having a sport, I mean tennis is a good example, dominated by three, 35 plus-year-old people who dominate sport for 20 years, in that you don't then have a new crop of celebrities coming through because all the focus is dominated by a couple. I don't think you need to have hundreds of stars in any sport. You need to have some really big stars in a sport, and it's a numerical thing. It doesn't need to be. tens or twenties, there will always be people aspire to be as successful as you do, whether you're in charge of students' union or whether you're in charge of sports events around the world. You want people to view you as being successful and you want them to compete with you to push you to further limits as well. So sports no different to that. I think You know, if you look at, I mean, boxing now, all we're talking about is when does Anthony Joshua fight Tyson Fury? Well, there's thousands of boxers all around the world. But the big conversations about the big fights. We asked him that when he came here a couple weeks ago. Yeah, he would. We tried very hard to get it, and he knows the truth because he knows we don't tell lies. But Tyson Fury didn't want the fight, really. That was the long and short of it. But it will happen perhaps one day. And if not, we're all saddened because it's a fight. we'd all like to see. But Joshua has other things on his plate first. He has to get past Alexander Usik, which is itself a no mean challenge. But it's all about his personality driven, isn't it? And you know, you throw in different things as well. I mean, Ousik brings, I don't know, the whole sentiment thing behind Ukraine into the ring with him. And that's another, you know, as the Scottish football team found out the other day, you know. But not the Welsh. Not the Welsh. The Welsh somehow the other delivered. But even that was a known goal, so you couldn't stop the Ukrainian being involved in it. But no, the big thing is the growing of the personality and the job that the promoters. That's why you mustn't just look for a quick keel in life. It doesn't work like that. You need consistency. You need consistent to be successful business. To be a successful sports star, you have to be a consistent winner. To be successful in business, you have to be consistently winning in business. This is exactly the same rules. And over a period of time, life gets easier. I asked Steve Davis, my old mate once, how do you do it? How do you put up with all this pressure playing at the crucible? And he said, I've played so many thousands of games. He said, all my nerve ends are shattered. I don't feel pressure. It's just like going to work. We judge people by our standards, not by theirs. Does Ronio Sullivan feel pressure? maybe right at the end of a tournament when he sees the winning line. But before that, he just doesn't seem to care, does he? I think that Steve Davis summed it up to me once. He said, in sport, if you can play as if it means nothing, when it means everything, then you won't go far wrong. And business is exactly the same as that. You cannot go into any business model saying, today I have to make money. You're on pressure, you're under pressure. You don't do that. You say, today I'm going to be as good as I can be. And what comes out of it I'll take? I'll take. Time for one more question. So I said, Tom. Barry, you're going to wait for the microphone. Great to have you here, Barry. I can vouch, actually, the book is amazing. I've read it cover to cover, so it's a brilliant book. You mentioned Steve Davis. So I've always had this question. I don't know the answer, but you're the guy to answer it. Steve was obviously world championed many times back in the 80s, and he still can play now. Is it a heart, like kind of a desire thing? Because it's not the most physical of sports, but it's the mental, and that's probably the biggest part. But could it, I'm sure you've spoken to Steve about it, could he perhaps, is there a reason why he can't maybe be number one again just because he's older, but the actual actual physical output is not necessarily the same. Well normally Tom I would say no there is no limit to how far you can go physically I mean in Steve's case there was lots of other reasons but Steve was more manufactured than the lot of so his father when he coached him was very disciplinary and over the shoulder straight queue you know it was scary when I used to watch Steve practicing he'd hit the white ball up and down the spots for half an hour. I mean, try doing it for five minutes. Your brain scrambled, but he'd do it over and over and over again. So a player like Davis, if he lost his passion for it, his cue action would go. And then a little bit of, I think, eyesight as well, that timing that just goes off edge. More natural players, I mean, Jimmy White bless him, he's still trying to win the world championships now after failing in six finals but he's still as keen as mustard and he hits the ball well and he's in his 60s you know and obviously Ronnie O'Sullivan's coming up to 50 and he's playing as well as I've seen in play so there is no real time scale on it but I think it's individuals but I think what happens is Tom is that the passion goes out of you and that implodes on your technical ability but when you wake up in the morning and anything in life. You may look at the person next to you and go, oh, I don't like you anymore. Or you may go to work and think, I don't fan, I just can't get going today. That's the time to make a change. So it's passion. Steve Davis went into music. He's just about to appear at his fifth Glastonbury, and he's the happiest I've ever seen him. So which one is right? So obviously Mr. Davis has got it right again. Good on him. I'm afraid we only have time for one more question, and that's the question we ask all of our speakers and they come to the union, which is what one piece of advice would you give to all the members of the Oxford Union and to all the students of the University of Oxford? One piece of advice, so difficult. Well, my one piece of advice was you'd have to read my book because there's so many pieces of advice in there. But that's enough of the plug for the book. I think, you know, don't take yourself too serious. Just be yourself and be the best you can. There's nothing else you can do and that'll make you happier than anything else. Don't set impossible targets to be realistic, but set one important target and that is to enjoy every hour, every day, every month. You'll be fine. Mr Hurdle will be signing copies of his book in the Gladstone Room after the talks. So feel free to come up and join us for that. Otherwise please join me in giving a massive round of applause. giving a massive round of applause to thank Mr Barry Hearn OBE. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
