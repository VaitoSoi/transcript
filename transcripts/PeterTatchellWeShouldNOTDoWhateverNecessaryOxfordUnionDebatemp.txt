 I now look to Peter Tatchell to close the debate. Thank you very much. The motion before us tonight is this house would do whatever necessary. The motion succeeds or. fails on the exact wording of the motion, not on interpretation or assumptions of what it might mean or what the proposers want it to mean. We've heard the proposals say they exclude violence, but the motion does not exclude violence. You are being asked tonight to vote on the exact literal meaning of the motion and nothing more or nothing less. In many respects, I would normally be inclined to support this motion. I'm a radical human rights defender. I seek a fundamental change in society and the global order to ensure equality, freedom and justice for all people in every country. I speak as someone who is engaged in non-violent, direct action and civil disobedience for 55 years. I participated in over 3,000 protests, being arrested more than 100 times, and been violently assaulted more than 300 times mostly by far-right extremists and defenders of tyrannical regimes. When I sought to place the Zimbabwean dictator President Robert Mugabe under arrest in Brussels on charges of torture, I did so non-violently. The violence directed against me by his bodyguards, who eventually beat me unconscious, was proof and power of nonviolence. Because the world saw a dictator having his bodyguards beat a peaceful protester, unconscious in the heart of a European capital city, in broad daylight, in front of the world's media, and concluded, just imagine what he does to his own African people when no one is watching. The power of non-violence. I said that I would be inclined to support this motion, but it is too open-ended, too non-specific, too open to multiple interpretations and meanings. Well, is it not the case that his violence is not necessary, as the proposition arguments, that their arguments are completely in lightened the motion. No, but I'll come back to that. Tonight's motion could have been drafted by President Vladimir Putin. He has said that he will do whatever is necessary to subjugate, occupy and take over Ukraine. What does this motion mean? Do whatever necessary to achieve what? Scottish independence, an end to racism, the defence of Ukraine. It is so open-ended, it has no meaning. And if you vote for it, you are allowing people to take this motion and use it to justify whatever unjust cause they may support and whatever foul method they may use to achieve it. The lack of clarity about this motion and what it refers to means that I cannot support it. Moreover, whatever is necessary suggest that any action is justified and legitimate. If you pass this motion, you are saying that you agree the ends justify the means. It means by implication that you will endorse anything rioting, murder, extortion, rape, war crimes. On the point of question, could you name me a time when it would be necessary to commit a war crime to achieve a just end? If the motions in that is not about just ends. You are reading into this motion wording that does not exist, so your point is invalid. The United States, when it invaded and occupied Vietnam, it also used the justification whatever is necessary to defeat communism. And look at the price the Vietnamese people paid for those horrific war crimes by the United States. States. No, I won't take any more, sorry. What you're doing is you're saying that these methods are justifiable, and in your case you're saying they're justifiable, albeit for a higher noble cause. But by saying that any methods, whatever methods are necessary, I think you were going down a very dangerous road. Doing whatever is necessary has been the rationale of every tyrant in history. Joseph Stalin had the goal of a classless communist society and he said whatever is necessary to achieve that was justified. He caused mass famine, the gulags. He said that the individual must be sacrificed to the collective for the sake of the greater good, because he believed to do what is ever necessary. Violence, can it is true, be justified as a last resort, in circumstances where avenues for peaceful democratic change are blocked. That is true, and I wish And I wished the motion and said that, but it doesn't say that. So, for example, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, violence to defeat Hitler was the only option. In Zimbabwe, faced with a brutal white minority rule by Ian Smith's regime, African people and their white allies, allies had no option but to wage a war of national liberation. In Syria today, the democratic opposition has no option but to fight an armed resistance against the dictatorship of Bashir al-Assad. But in democratic societies, where there are the options of peaceful change. I emphasize, despite the imperfections of democratic societies, where those options do exist, then I do not agree that violence is necessary or justified. No, I won't. I'm running out of time. And I'll give you an example. Once you go down the road of justifying violence, in democratic societies where peaceful change is possible, then the focus becomes on the violent tactics, not on the just cause. So, for example, I have always supported a United Ireland. The artificial partitioning of Ireland by Britain is still a colonial legacy, which should have never, ever happened. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association used the Martin Luther King tactics of non-violent civil disobedience and protest. They won the hearts and minds of the British people. But when the IRA resorted to terrorism, public opinion turned against. Because the focus became the IRA's tactics, not the legitimate goal of a United Ireland. And we see today that Sinn FÃ©in is using peaceful, lawful, means for United Island and their support is growing as is public support for Irish unity. I just want to remind you that even in very adverse circumstances, nonviolence can win. During the Second World War, the Danish people using nonviolent civil resistance undermined the Nazi war effort and help save the life of every single Jewish person. I think the lesson is clear. We must maintain the moral high ground. We must act in ways that are consistent with the values and goals to which we aspire. If we postport this motion, we are saying to do whatever necessary gives a carp lunch to people to do whatever they want, no matter how immoral, unethical or brutal. I urge you to support the motion.
