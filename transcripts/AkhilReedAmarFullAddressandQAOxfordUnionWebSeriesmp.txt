 Good evening everyone. My name is Rachel and I'm the librarian here at the Oxford Union. And today we are joined by a very special guest, Professor Akil Reid Amar. Professor Akil is one of the leading American scholars. He specialises in constitutional law and criminal procedure. Akil is currently a professor of law at Yale and he's one of the most cited legal scholars and has been referenced numerous times by the Supreme Court. Akil, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you so much for having me. Good evening to you all. Perhaps I should say good afternoon because you see here at Yale University, it is the afternoon and therein perhaps lies my tale about the similar and differences between the view from one side of the Atlantic and the view from the other side of the Atlantic. It's a great honor to be with you. And when I received a formal invitation from the Oxford Union, I immediately actually used that word that it was a great honor to be invited. But in my stupid American way, I omitted, of course, the letter you in honor. So once again, there's a commonality. America and Britain are both connected and divided by a common language, by a shared history, by a common tradition of constitutionalism, common law. These things both link us, and divide us, as does the Atlantic Ocean itself. It connects us and divides Old England and New England. And I thought, perhaps I should talk a bit about that and give you the perspective, very much an American perspective, on this special relationship. Here's another way. So I want to talk about the U, the letter U, which of course appears in any proper British spelling of honor, And it is a great honor to be with you all, but we should be Americans omit. Let me share with you one other, just a picture that maybe also captures what I'm hoping to talk about. So this is a picture taken 10 years ago at Yale University. The lad in the picture is my son, Vic. He's now an undergraduate at Yale, and he's with a very distinguished Oxonian. You'll recognize Tony Blair. And here's why I wanted to share with you that fun picture. At a very young, and I shared this with Tony Blair, and he thought it amusing. At the age of about six, Vic had learned his presidents, the way many of you perhaps have learned the monarch. of England and Britain, at least post-conquest. Some of you probably even memorized the monarchs pre-conquest. But Vic had learned his presidents. Okay, and that's the backstory. So he comes up to me, he's five years old, maybe six, and he says, Dad, when did the British become our friends? Which is the topic today. And I said, Vic, that's a very interesting question. Why do you ask? And he says, Dad, George Washington fought against the British, Dwight Eisenhower fought alongside the British. So sometime in between, they must have become our friends. And I said, well, actually, that's a very interesting way of thinking historically. So when did the British become our friends? And how did the British become our friends? And what about this special relationship that we have? The English language, common law, certain constitutional tradition. So that's in part what I'm trying to explore in my latest book, which is entitled The Words That Made Us, America's Constitutional Conversation, 1760 to 1840. And there's a bit of a pun in that last word, us. It's the words that made the U.S. So it's a question, I'm asking in part of the question of how America becomes America. And I start in 1760, because here's what I want to tell you. In 1760, really, there isn't a strong sense of America. there is a strong sense of Britishers, Britons, living in the new world. There are separate mainland colonies. 13 eventually will rebel, will revolt in 1776. But in 1760, Boston is not talking, which is in Massachusetts, the province of Massachusetts is not talking to Williamsburg, which is the capital of the colony of Virginia. They're not talking to each other. They're both talking to London. You see, Massachusetts exists as a formal juridical entity. And so does Virginia and so does New York. But America doesn't quite exist as such. And in 1760, they are very proud Britons. And how does it unravel so soon? That's actually Act 1, Scene 1 of my book. And I begin with the nanosecond, the moment that the news reaches America. What's the news? They have a new king. George III now sits on the throne. His grandfather, George II, has passed away in late October, 1760. And right before Christmas, word reaches the new world, reaches Boston. And in Act 1, Scene 1, the Americans are raising their tankards of ale and hailing, toasting their new king. They are so proud to be Britons in America. And so the question is, and if that's so, how did it unravel so fast? And here's one little tidbit. Well, first, why are the Americans so? proud because they come from an extraordinary legal culture. They're naming their towns and regions after places in Britain. I have a home in Guilford, Connecticut. The larger region that I inhabit is called New England, as in Old England. So they brought their language, they brought their institutions. They're very pretty, and in 1760, the British empire is also in the process of defeating the French nation in the new world, very dramatically, in what the rest of the world today calls the Seven Years War, what Americans call the French and Indian War. And in 1760, it's clear that the Brits are going to, alongside their American colonists are going to win. And they're going to defeat, they've defeated the French nation at Quebec and at Morayal, and it's It's pretty clear now that British power will prevail in most of North America. And the Bostonians are so very proud of that. And the Brits have not yet started to impose taxes on America. We don't have the Stamp Act. We don't have the Sugar Act. We don't have these later developments that will result in eventually in 1776 and independence being declared. the British government is behaving quite admirably. And yet in chapter one, I show that the Americans are beginning to itch and agitate. They're beginning to actually want to be independent. And the irony is they want to be independent precisely because the British nation has, the British Empire has defeated the French nation. They don't need the Brits anymore to protect them against the French. They're like 17 year old adolescents who basically realize they don't have to live with mom dad anymore and they want the keys to the car. And so the story that I begin with is the story in which actually the Americans aren't quite being fair to the Brits. But the Brits make a mistake. And here's the mistake they make in the Act when seen one. They are not paying sufficient attention to the Americans. They do not actually give the their columnist's instructions about what to do. now that we have a new king, should you proclaim the king? King George is proclaimed in all the markets, cities and towns in Britain, but no one, and there's pomp and pageantry. There's, well, actually, here's things, some things that happen. Cryers up and down Britain proclaim the old king's grandson by the style of George III, King of Great Britain, France and Ireland defender of the faith. The 1,000 London merchants are gathered to kiss his majesty's hand. Parliament is pro-robed. But the sword of state is carried to and from the Chapel Royal. There's an elaborate coffin. There are elaborate sermons that are preached under the superintendent eye of the Archbishop of Canterbury. But no one can be bothered to say. send instructions to the new world about what they're supposed to do. So there's a certain imperial neglect that will eventually have its cost. The Brits aren't paying as much attention to the Americans as the Americans are to the Brits. I'm going to fast forward and I'm going to read you a couple more passages and then let's talk about what happens after the American Revolution and how our countries move. forward, sometimes together, sometimes apart. So first, the British, so the Americans are starting to misbehave truthfully even before the Brits have done anything wrong. But in later chapters of my story, the Brits do begin to impose taxes on Americans. They send troops to America. They abrogate jury trials in America in all sorts of ways. They are violating certain basic British liberties. As Americans understand, their rights as Britons. And okay, so now there's a disagreement. And Americans petition for redress. They actually tell people in Britain don't do this. And the British actually are paying attention. So that is a fundamental problem in the American experience, is the Brits are not actually listening to the Americans. The Americans are beginning to talk amongst themselves with newspapers and the British aren't particularly listening. So that most important language of the Declaration of Independence is at the very end of the Declaration, the Declaration says, we've sent these petitions again and again, and they're not being heated, where they're not being listened to. Here's the language. We am in every stage of our oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms. Our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which made to find a tyrant is unfit to be the rule of a free people. But his biggest mistake is he wasn't listening to his subjects. And this is, I think, a fundamental point that is missed by a very important new book by a very great British scholar, Andrew Roberts. The book is called The Last King of America. And maybe we can talk about it a bit because I have some criticisms of it. And although he's a very distinguished British historian, of course, he's a Cantor Bridge in. He's not an Oxonian. So if ever I'm going to get a friendly audience for a, you know, a, critique of this important book. It would be here at the Oxford Union. I just want to read you one final passage from the Declaration of Independence that got pulled out of the declaration. But you'll hear in it a deep longing and affection that the Americans ultimately feel as if they're the younger siblings who were being snubbed by their older brothers. So here's some language that got pulled up, but it's so deeply emotional. So these, all of these grievances that we've experienced have given the last stab to agonizing affection. and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever these unfeeling brethren. We must endeavor to forget our former love for them and to hold them as who hold the rest of mankind, enemies and war, in peace, friends. We might have been a free and great people together. But a communication of grandeur and of freedom, it seems, is below their dignity. Be it so, since they will have it. The road to glory and happiness is open to us too. We will climb it in a separate state and acquiesce in the necessity which pronounces our everlasting adieu. In this, you hear actually the voice almost of a jilted lover, Americans who were so proud of being Britain, so proud of their young new king, so proud of the British Empire, which is bested the French nation, which is three times as large. That's 1760 in America. it all unravels so very fast. Later on, there will be a rapprochement, America and Britain do become friends again, and we can talk about how that happens and why that happens, but I just thought it might be interesting to talk a little bit about a world in which Americans did not see themselves as Americans. They saw themselves as Britons, the beginning of my story, 1760, and how in 16 years, they develop a sense of Americanness, the words that made us, a we and a sense of separation from the mother country. Thanks so much. Thank you so much, Akil. Thank you. I know just now you mentioned your book, the words that made us. I understand that this is part of a series that you've been working on. I know you've spoken a bit about what is included in the book, but I was wondering what inspired you to create this series and what your hopes are in order in terms of achievement as a result. as a result of the series? So we're talking and talking candidly about American culture and comparing contrast into British culture. Americans generally don't have much of a sense of history. We have much less history as an independent people than do our friends in Britain. So our story really as a nation begins in 1760 when we're not yet. when we're not yet a nation, but, but in the Americans are going to, in the end, revolt against a particular person, George III. And it's very personal. They are born under the allegiance, under the protection of a British sovereign. And to break that bond is to many, it would be as unnatural as today to try to divorce your own parents. How can you do that? They're forever your parents. To trade your, liver to reverse your sex, to undo your blood. Now, again, medical technology makes some of these possible today, but they would have thought it very unnatural indeed. Okay. So I'm trying to tell a story of the American people, and I think it begins with George III taking the throne because they're going to, in the end, have to revolt against him. They're not revolting just against a monarchy. It's very personal. They're revolting against a particular monarch. So my story begins in 1760, but I'm going to try to carry it forward in a trilogy to the year 2000. So volume one is the words that made us, the US, how America is formed, how Americans become Americans, and America becomes America, 1760 to 1840. Volume two, which I'm working on now, and amazingly, it begins in London. I'll tell you just a bit about why Act One Seen one of that book, is actually a London story. The words that made us equal America's constitutional conversation 1840 to 1920. And it begins actually with the world, and so it's gonna be about women's equality and black equality and end to slavery in America. It begins with the world first anti-slavery convention held in London. And Americans come over, American abolitionists, and they link, up arms with British abolitionists and abolitionists from across the world. It's a great conference in the world's arguably greatest city. That's act one, seen one. But what's so interesting is the women at the event, mainly American women, are excluded by the men. The men say, well, you can watch, but you can't be delegates. And then and there, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, on her honeymoon, an American in London, Lucretia Mott, another great American woman leader, they decide strolling arm in arm in London that they're gonna actually, when they get back to America, have a women's convention. It will become a thing called Seneca Falls. It will eventually lead to a woman's suffrage movement. So I begin in London and it's all about blacks and women and ending slavery and but also what about women's equality. And it's gonna end in 1920, with in America the enfranchisement of all women. And of course, things are happening in England at the same time with the Mrs. Pankhurst and the suffragettes. That's volume two, the words that made us equal. And it's very much a British story alongside an American story. British, of course, also ending slavery earlier in the empire in 1833, but Americans actually are as early as 1775, creating abolitionist societies, inspired in part by, Brits like Granville Sharp and other abolitionists in Britain. So an interesting conversation between British abolitionists and American abolitionists that's hinted at in volume one, but it's going to be the centerpiece of volume two, the words that made us equal, America's constitutional conversation 1840 to 1920. And volume three will be the words that made us modern America's constitutional conversation 1920 to 2000. And the goal is to do something a little bit similar to what the great Andrew Roberts has done, which is to provide the British people with a series of books, a sense of their national history and identity. I'm somewhat critical of this one, the last King of America, which we might talk about, but he's written an epic book about Churchill. He's written books about Napoleon, but he is a national chronicler of the British story. I'm trying to be a national chronicler of the American story with a particular emphasis on the American constitutional saga. Thank you. Thanks so much, Akil. I know in terms of your career, you've had a very long career studying law, teaching it as well. I know you started off as a law clerk to actually Stephen Breyer, who was a US Supreme Court Justice. I was wondering how this experience was for you and how it influenced your passion to study law and write about constitution. law in America. So, you know, it said that no man is a hero to his valid. I don't think that's true when it comes to my relationship to Justice Stephen Breyer. I was in effect his valets, his law clerk, and he's a hero to me. He was a wonderful mentor. He continues to be a great friend. But in the spirit of talking, again, about our common culture, let me tell you a thing or two about Steve. a thing or two about Stephen Breyer. Stephen Breyer is an American. He grows up in the San Francisco Bay Area, as do I. Eventually, he will go to the, he grows up in California, the West Coast, but eventually he'll find his way to the East Coast, as do I, he's at Harvard, I'm at Yale. But here's something that your audience may not No, he actually spends a time in England. He is a Marshall scholar. And this is life-changing for him because when in England, he meets someone, they fall in love, they get married. She is the former Joanna Hare. Her father, Lord Hare, I believe, was actually the head of the Conservative Party, the Tory Party in Britain. So Stephen Breyer is an American who thinks a lot about Britain, who married a British lady, and who is on the Supreme Court perhaps more interested in comparative constitutional law than perhaps any of his other colleagues. And that interest, I think, began early on when he was a student in Britain. Yeah, that's very interesting to hear. I know also, aside from your work and your publications, you've actually done a lot of work educating people through your podcast, America's Constitution. I was wondering what led you to do the podcast and use that as an avenue to connect with people and what your hopes are for connecting with people through the podcast. So I think the younger generation experiences information differently than my generation. I'm a book person. So that's why, you know, I'm talking about this is, and this isn't just a book. This is a tone. This is a weighty book, this Andrew Roberts book. And I tried to write something, you know, comparably weighty. But the younger generation, I think, just information differently. And they often like to experience it when they're exercising on their exercise bike or taking a walk. They just put their earbuds in. And when they're in a car, when they're on a train. and so the podcast seemed to be a way to actually reach people on the go and their very busy lives. Now, continuing my theme of the similarities of our culture, I've already shown you a picture of our son, Vic, He's now an undergraduate at Yale. When the kids were young, we have three kids, they're all in college now. We did encourage them to read books. And I think they are book readers to some extent. I think most people in the younger generation are less book folks than people, oldsters like yours truly. But we also did expose them to audio books, which are an early version, of the podcast, when you're just, you know, experiencing the spoken word. And I want to tell you about several of my favorite audiobooks because they are great British authors and audiobooks. And here's what, and the books in particular that I most loved sharing with my kids when we're in the car. So it's not a podcast, yet the podcast hasn't quite been invented 20 years ago, but it's audio books. It's something like that. And my favorites were two sets of books. Books where the English language is at its finest. So I had my kids listen and audio tape to all of Jane Austen because I just love her command of the language. The other series of books that they absolutely adored were the Harry Potter. Potter books. And the Harry Potter books, you can read them, and that's great. You can see the movies, and that's great, but the movies cut out so much. Maybe the best way, I think, to experience Harry Potter, in fact, is the audio tapes, because J.K. Rowling, like, let's say, Dickens before her, she has spectacular characters. And when these characters are rendered by a great actor who does all the voices on an audio tape, that's better than the movie because you're getting the whole literary experience, maybe even better than the book in a way because you're hearing all the characters' voices, you know, Hermione or Harry or Snape or Dumbledore, beautifully rendered. So I think truthfully, experiencing great audio books often by great British authors. I also really loved, although this wasn't for the kids, Martin Gilbert's biography of Churchill, and his history of Israel, which I also read. So most of my favorite audiobooks, frankly, have been by British authors, Austin, Martin Gilbert, J.K. Rowland to pick Just three. And the podcast, I think, was a way of trying to pay it back to a new generation by giving them an audio experience to supplement these very long ponderous books. Yeah, thanks, thank, Akil. I definitely agree with that. I know, especially myself, like, audio books and podcasts are a good way to, you know, taking information on a topic you're interested in. Also, I wanted to ask a bit about your book, America's Unwritten Constitution. I know in this book, you talk a lot about how the Constitution is, not just based on the text that's in it, but there's so much that comes into that. I was wondering if you'd like to explain and elaborate a bit about that. And I know, especially with the UK's constitution being an unwritten one, I think that kind of comes into it as well. Thank you. You're absolutely right. The misimpression that's out there is the Brits have an unwritten constitution and the Americans have a written constitution. And yes, that's true. But, only partial because I believe the Americans have an unwritten constitution in the British tradition. So we have both. And we have a single composite text that anchors the project, our written constitution. And there are many aspects of the British system that of course are written, but they're not in one composite text, much less one composite text that has been voted on in some special way by the electorate. But of course, Magna Carta is central to the British constitutional experience. And so is Petition of Rights. And so is the habeas corpus act of 1679 and the English Bill of Rights or Declaration of Rights of 1688, 89. And many other things that are written, the Seven Bishops case, or the Five Knights case, or the Shipmoney case. So of course, there are written texts that are central to the British experience, but they're not. reduced to, I'm just distilled into one composite document in the vernacular short that ordinary people could read and reread and be asked to vote on. So the Brits don't quite have anything that's exactly equivalent to an American-style written constitution. But I believe that the Americans, in addition to our written constitution, do very much have a British-style unwritten constitution, which fills in the gaps, which completes and unifies and makes coherent the written constitution. The written constitution, for example, just take a really simple thing. It doesn't tell you how to read it. And you can say, well, of course, you just read it with the rules of ordinary English, but that's not true. So, and that's, and chapter one is there actually are rules for reading America's written constitution. They are themselves not written. And even if they were, how do you interpret the rules of interpretation? And then how do you interpret the rules of interpreting the rules of interpretation? There's an infinite regress. But American constitution doesn't actually have an exhaustive set of rules about how to interpret. That's set. So that's unwritten and it's central. And again, you might say, well, you, of course you don't need to set words. They're called the English language. Just English grammar and syntax and, but it's not true. So here's what the first question I asked. And it's a, it's a law joke. It's not a lawyer joke. I don't tell too many lawyer jokes because, you know, lawyers don't think they're funny. In ordinary people don't think they're jokes. But, but here's a law joke. If you read the Constitution, who presides at the vice president's impeachment trial? And after about 10 seconds, if I'm talking to a group of American lawyers, someone starts to chuckle. Here's why. Simple question, who presides at Kamala Harris's impeachment trial, if she were to be impeached, vice president's impeachment trial? Because if you read the words, the words say the two things absolutely clearly. The Senate of the United States tries all impeachments. Article 1, Section 3. This is a short document, and it says that really clear. The Senate tries all impeachments. It also says the vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate. Now, there are two exceptions to that. When the vice president isn't present, there's a president pro tem, but in my hypothetical, the vice president is present. She says, please hand me the gavel. I'm the defendant. I'd like the gavel. There's also an exception when a president is being impeached, the chief justice presides, the chief justice in the United States. but what about when the vice president is impeached? Well, under the rules of English, rules of grammar and syntax, it would seem that the vice president presides at our own impeachment. But that can't be right because there is an unwritten constitution. And here's a first principle of the unwritten constitution. No person can be a judge in his own case. It goes back to Roman times, Cicero, Nemo Udex, Kausa, Sua. It's in Blackstone, who was, actually an important authority for the American revolutionaries, the American constitutionalist. He actually says very famously that the words of statutes have to be read against an unwritten backdrop of rules of interpretation. And he says, there's a rule of absurdity. When the literal words lead to an absurd outcome that Parliament could never have intended, we deviate from the words. And he gives two examples. One, if the statute says all disputes that arise in the manor dale shall be tried by the lord of the manor dale, the lord of the mannedale of course can preside over disputes between two of his tenants about a pig or cow or sheep or whatever. But of course the lord of the manordale could never preside over any dispute that involved himself because no man can be a judge in his own case. That's Blackstone's first example. And it's just like my vice president one. You see, vice president can't be a judge in his own case. And the framers knew that because they had red Blackstone and they had red luck. Here's this other John Locke, who says the same thing. No man can be a judge in his own case. Here's Blackstone's second example. He says if the law, the law of Bologna, very famous he said, anyone who sheds blood on the streets of Bologna shall surely suffer death. Now, if a surgeon administers an emergency tracheotomy to some, someone who has fallen down on the streets of Bologna and is choking to death. And in order to save that person's life, a surgeon pulls out a pen knife and performs an emergency tracheotomy to clear the airways. Literally, that surgeon has spilled blood on the streets of Bologna and under the literal words of that statute, he shall surely suffer death. But of course, we wouldn't put him to death. we would hang him, we give him a medal. We would thank him profusely. Why? Because there's an unwritten set of interpretive rules. That's only one part of America's unwritten constitution, but I begin that way saying you can't just read the words. There are larger principles behind them, the rule of law, checks and balances, separation of powers, federalism in the American system. That's one of many different ways in which we need an unwritten constitution to complete our written one. The written one says they're unenumerated rights. They're not textually specified, but where do we find them? The constitution doesn't tell us quite about what the next set of amendments should be, but there actually, I believe, are British constitution-like rules about how we're going to adopt our next constitutional amendment and what it should look like. So that entire book is an homage to our friends in Britain who understand that there's an unwritten constitutional system because my claim is we've got one also. We're just not self-aware about that. Some people think we only have an American-style written constitution. I say no, we have an American-style written constitution and a British unwritten constitution that completes it, that makes it coherent. And the tricky thing is that unwritten constitution has to fit in a certain way with the written constitution. And that's not so easy to do. If you're going to go beyond the text, go beneath, beyond, behind it, how do you do that while always maintaining fidelity and loyalty to the text that's at the center of our project? And that's why it takes another, I'll show it to you. It's another big, fat book, but it's absolutely in the tradition of Dicey and Bagshot and Blackstone and Great British Constitutional thinkers. Akil, you've told us a lot about the interpretation of the Constitution, and I know this is done by, obviously done by courts, and a lot of people, especially within America, have accused the American courts of being politically biased in some way. I don't know what your opinion would be on this and how, if so, if you agree, how you think we can really solve the problem to make sure that the interpretations of our constitution are as reliable as possible. So that's where these books come in. Our process of selecting judges is by design political in a certain way. ordinary people vote for presidents and senators and senators and presidents pick judges and justices. So that's not a bug. It's a feature that's part of the design, but there is regular political input. Is it possible to imagine a different system? Yes. Imagine a system where the judges pick their own successors infinitely. Where popes pick cardinals who pick popes, who pick cardinals, and it's a self-contained system. or where the current generation of the Yale Law School faculty, it's the next generation of the Yale Law School faculty, who picks the next generation in a self-perpetuating veerian meritocracy, or at least that's how it understands itself. Critics could say it's not living up to its meritocratic ideals, but that's not our system. Judges actually don't pick the next generation of judges, presidents and senators do and ordinary voters pick presidents and senators. So that's baked in to the system. That said, I believe that although there's political input into the selection of judges, once you're a judge or justice, you're supposed to be a judge or justice for good behavior for life. You're at the federal level. You don't have to actually have decisions that are broadly popular, you're supposed to follow the law and not follow the polls or and follow the election returns. You're put on the court and maybe you're put on the court because the president wants you to do X, Y, and Z, and the president's party does. But when the case comes before you and you think about it, you actually think X, Y, or Z is not the right answer. Or you may change your mind over time, and you can't easily be removed just because, your considered legal view is different from what the president who appointed you would like or the Senate that confirmed you would like. So a political system of appointment, yes, and I think it's supposed to be in principle an apolitical system of interpretation thereafter. That's what life tenure is all about, tenure for good behavior, strictly speaking. And where do we get that phrase good behavior? we get it from our British forebears and the Act of Settlement, for example, which provides for good behavior for British judges, but actually not initially for American judges. It's one of the complaints of the Declaration of Independence is that the British authorities have made American judges dependent on their will, on royal will, because that's not true of British judges, but that in Britain, post-active settlement, 1701, but it is true of a American judges. So, okay, I want my judges to be apolitical, but what does that mean? There are at least two or three different ways of being apolitical. One would be focusing primarily on precedents, judicial precedents, and that would be particularly important in an unwritten constitutional system. But in America, there's an alternative, it's to pay a lot of attention to the written constitution. And that focus on an attention to the written constitution in America today goes by the label of originalism, pay particular attention to this canonical text, to this short text that was actually ratified by the citizenry itself. I tend to be an originalist. I tend to think that actually if the precedents have drifted away from what the constitution really means, we're going to come back to that phrase, really, and quotes me, then we should actually try to be faithful to the text itself, which is our ultimate law. The Constitution itself is the supreme law of our land in a thing called the supremacy class, not the cases. Okay. How are ideally apolitical judges supposed to do their job, which is to actually channel in the end the written constitution and as many amendments, when they themselves may not be constitutional scholars. That's where a constitutional scholar like me comes in. I'm trying to write books for a broad audience of law students today, but they are going to be the judges of tomorrow. And I'm trying to be, I'm sure failing in various ways, apolitical to try to tell the story of the American Constitution, to be a chronicler of the American constitutional saga. It's going to take me several books to get from 1760 all the way to 2000. The original constitution, the Declaration of Independence and the original constitution, in the early amendment to what we call the Bill of Rights, that's volume one. The system is going to fail. It's going to generate a civil war because Americans actually failed to really solve the slavery problem. And what about people who are disfranchised the founding above and beyond slaves like America's women? So that's volume two, the words that made us equal, 1840, America's constitutional conversation, 1840, 1920. What about things that happen after that? In my lifetime, for example, we amended the Constitution many times. We gave 18-year-olds the vote. We got rid of poll tax disfranchisement. We did other things. The words that made us modern. So if I write a series of books that I'm hoping are not political, that just try to get the facts straight, whether the facts are convenient from my political point of view or inconvenient, then I can hope to have some materials for the next generation of judges who then can rely on this as I hope. a political information that can help them do their job. And quite candidly, I'm trying to, in this process, be a version of the American, an American version of Blackstone. Someone who's actually trying to write a series of books for his fellow Britons, for his fellow subjects that would be useful for lawyers and judges, but also for members of parliament and ministers and the society more general. That's what I'm trying to do. So the judges actually can do their jobs because they can't be scholars. And on every single issue, it requires deep research. So that's what I get paid to do. Every day I get up. I try to read something and read some more and read some more and then eventually write something that will be useful for judges. judges and my fellow citizens, and of course my students who are to repeat, especially at a place like Yale, the judges of the future. As you know, a very high percentage of the justices on our Supreme Court come from two schools in particular in the modern era, Harvard and Yale, just as a very high percentage of influential folks in British politics and civil service come from Oxford. Yeah, I think it's great that we're talking on the topic of Yale. And I know from speaking to many friends who are lawyers that your work is held in high regard and is kind of helping to inform their journey throughout learning law. I know recently you've spoken out about Yale Law School and your experience there. And you've kind of mentioned the lack of academic freedom you've been experiencing. I just wanted to hear your experiences with that because I know like at the Oxford Union, we really do value free speech. And I know with law, it is important to be apolitical, to be able to speak out and say your views. So what do you think Yale is doing? And how can they make it easier for people to learn more about law? I'm trying to model respect for the argument on the other side. I'm a liberal. I'm a day. I'm a liberal. I'm a Democrat. So what does that mean? That means that I voted for Joe Biden. I voted for Hillary Clinton. I voted for Bill Clinton. I voted for Jimmy Carter and actually in the primaries that year in one year for Ted Kennedy. Okay. But my personal views are not the same as my legal views because I'm trying to actually be a model. of legal judgment. So I'm going to pick several things where my personal views are at odds with my legal interpretation. I don't much love guns. That's another issue that unites and divides Americans. Americans are gun-loving culture, at least going to lead to an American revolution by force of arms, and that's not as true in Britain. There are more guns in America than there are Americans by most tally. There are more than 300 million guns, most people estimate, in America. You won't find a gun in my house. I don't love guns, truthfully. But I believe that a right to have a gun in one's home for self-protection is part of America's Constitution, both written and unwritten, even if there weren't a Second Amendment, which talks mainly about militias, you see. Part of America's unwritten constitution, Constitution is a right to have a gun in the home for self-protection. Where am I conjuring that up? So that connects back to America's unwritten Constitution. The Constitution says there are unenumerated rights. Where do we find that American traditions, customs, practices, state constitutions, common law tradition. If you read Blackstone, actually, when the fifth auxiliary right is a right of self-defense and self-protection, all the way back to Samain's case, which is something like 1607 or something like that. There's this idea that a man's house is his castle and you can use deadly force to repel an invader. My Lord Cook actually writes about all of that. So, so take guns. They're a lot, they're part of American culture. They're part of our unwritten American constitution. They're in a bunch of state constitutions. They're in our common law tradition. They're in our customs. They're part of America for better and worse. I don't have a gun in my home for self-protection, but I think you have a right to have one in yours. So my legal view, are different than my personal political preferences. I myself don't like capital punishment, the death penalty, but in certain situations, I think it is permissible. And let me take a third one. So death penalty, that's actually pretty high hot button. I personally am pro-choice. I believe in reproductive freedom for women, but I think Roe versus Wade is not a well-reasoned opinion, in fact. So those are three big ones. So now what does that mean for Yale in particular? I believe, even though I'm a liberal, I'm a Democrat, my students would be well served by having conservatives and Republicans on our faculty making arguments that are different from mine. I'm trying to be fair to both sides, but I'm a liberal. I think that our students will learn best if they get the strongest argument on one side and the strongest argument on the other. Now, it's so difficult to do because here's how it looks like. I told you, see, the faculty picks the next generation, picks the next generation. So here's how people think. You say, well, I'm smart and I'm a liberal. So the people who don't agree with me, they must just, they must not be smart. And I'm supposed to hire smart people, so I should hire people who think like me because we're the smart people. It's such a natural tendency, but I try to work against it. So I try to look out there and say, okay, I think I'm doing my best here, trying to come up with smart arguments, but I bet I'm missing some things. Who's the smartest folks out there who actually have a different point of view? Let's get them on the faculty, too. I'm very much influenced this. I've been talking about the, you know, the inspirations, the British inspirations for many American thoughts. I'm very much influenced by John Stuart Mill in all of this. So I'm a million liberal who very much believes in the clash of ideas and political legal discourse. I don't think my students are well served if they only know how to the liberal side of every issue because they're going to go out there in the world and most of the justices on the Supreme Court are actually not liberal. And ours is a very pyramidic system. So even if lower court judges have a higher percentage of liberals and moderates, and they might, but they answer to a Supreme Court, so it's a very strongly hierarchical system, my students are not going to be well served if they don't understand conservative arguments as well as liberal arguments. And that, I think, will best happen when we have students across the political spectrum and legal spectrum and we have professors across the spectrum. And so I have been speaking out saying, I do think that conservative organizations at Yale need to be valued and nurtured, even especially when I disagree with them. I want them to speak up. I want them to show me where they think I'm making a mistake and we liberals are making mistakes. And that's the tradition of the union. Yeah, definitely. That is definitely the tradition of the union, you know, having different ideas and letting that clash happen and seeing how we can all grow from it and engage with it is definitely what we aim to do. For our next question, I have a question that's been submitted in by a member who is watching the event today. So the member has asked about the recent case about the vaccine mandate that happened and it was argued that the occupational and safety health act was actually a violation of the non-delegation doctrine and and in turn, the Constitution's separation of powers. So we just wanted to hear from you what you think about the non-delegation doctrine in this case and how you think the Supreme Court justices should have addressed it. Right. They were two recent vaccine cases, a vaccine mandate cases that the Supreme Court decided. In the one case, three liberal justices, justices Sotomayor, Kagan and Breyer. We're joined by three moderate justices, the Chief Justice, John Roberts, along with Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney-Barratt. So, and on the far right of the court, justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Sam Alito dissented. In that case, the vaccine mandate case that was about a presidential order that federal contract, in the medical establishment, people who were working, getting federal dollars in a federal medical system had to be vaccinated. And the court said that was permissible, six to three. At the same time, a different six to three ruling said that another Biden order was illegal. And that Biden order was a requirement that large employers had to mandate vaccines with certain exceptions. And people who weren't vaccinated would have to have a certain kind of testing regimen. And by six to three vote, the Supreme Court invalidated that. The three liberals said that's fine. So to Mayor Kagan and Breyer. And I'm calling them liberals. What I mean by that is they are registered. Democrats who were appointed by Democratic presidents and confirmed by Democratic Senate. I told you earlier, the process of selection is somewhat political. Of the other six, there are all six registered Republicans, they were all six appointed by nominated by Republican presidents and five of them were confirmed by Republican Senates. Only one was actually confirmed in a mixed government sort of system. That was Clarence Thomas, nominated by a Republican president, and confirmed by a Democratic Senate, and it was not a very nice, polite, ratification process. It was quite nasty. Okay, so in this vaccine mandate case that your questioner is asking about, it involves the occupational self safety and health administration, OSHA, which is about workplace safety. And the argument of the Biden administration is, was that this, vaccine rule that the administration is imposing on large employers, have more than 50 or 100 employees, is a sensible health and safety measure. And three liberals said, we agree, six conservatives said, no, the right wing, justices, Thomas Alito, and Gorsuch, now joined by the more centrist Republicans, the Chief Justice John Roberts, along with Amy Coney Barrett and Brett Kavanaugh. I'm with the liberals in that case. I'm with the liberals in both cases because I read the statute to mean what it says and say what it means. It says serious health issues in the workplace can be regulated. It's hard to imagine a more serious health issue than in COVID. It's contagious. People are getting it in the workplace, if it were a chemical agent, just a hydrocarbon sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, it could be regulated as a toxic, non-living threat to workplace health and safety. If it were an issue of safety of underground mines or something like that, that threatened workers, safety, just we need to have certain reinforcements of the mine. I'm a big fan of the Poldark novels and that's about underground mining, which is pretty dangerous actually and smelting. So if it's if it's about fumes created by smelting or coal dust created by underground mines or other sorts of chemicals that threaten worker safety, of course the occupational health and safety commission can issue regular. I think it's no different if it's a virus, that's a human agent. So this seems easy and obvious to me if you just read the statute to mean what it says and say it says and say what it means. And the person who says that very emphatically is Steven Breyer who taught administrative law at Harvard. And he says, this is in part why you have expert administrative agencies so they can look at the science of the thing. And I think it was scientifically supported and backed by. the basic common sense of the thing and the statutory language. Now what the court said is the statute could have been more clear on this. This is a big issue. Statues can always be more clear. The question is whether they're clear enough. And I think they are now here's the reality. Nothing in this opinion prevents Congress tomorrow from passing an ordinance, a statute authorizing this regulation. And the Democratic Democrats apparently don't have the votes for that. Remember in our system, it's bicameral. There's not just a House of Commons or House of Representatives, but there's a Senate and you need to get the supermajority in the Senate because of a thing called the filibuster. Your House of Lords basically has become vestigial beginning in 1911, but then later on with the Tony Blair reforms, but our Senate is still quite significant. So nothing, the court did not say it's unconstitutional, really, to have this regulation. They said Congress hasn't authorized it. I respectfully disagree, but Congress Camaro could pass the statute, but we Democrats don't have the votes. And so now you see I actually am a liberal on lots and lots of issues, but not on everything because I actually on, I try to look at the law on abortion to repeat. I'm pro-choice, but Roe versus Wade is not well-reasoned. I don't have a gun, but I think you have a right to have a gun in your home for self-protection. I don't love capital punishment, but there are at least certain situations where it would be constitutionally permissible, even though I wouldn't like it and I would vote against it. Thanks so much, Akil. Honestly, thank you so much for sharing your views with us. I think this has been definitely a very interesting event, and we've all got a very unique insight into constitutional law and your work so far as well as your work with Yale. Thanks so much for this event and thank you to all of the members who have joined and are watching this event today. And thank you so much for coming everyone. Thank you.
