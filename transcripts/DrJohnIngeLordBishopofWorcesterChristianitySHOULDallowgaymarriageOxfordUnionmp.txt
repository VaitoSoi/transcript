 Mr. President, Honourable Members, it's a great delight to be here this evening, and this has been a really fascinating debate. This debate has, in fact, it seems to me, and maybe seems to you, been going on for a very, very long time. And I don't mean just the fact that you've had to sit through quite a number of speeches this evening. I mean that the debate over the interpretation of scripture, which lies at the heart of what we're talking about this evening, has been argued over here in Oxford and across the world. We could go back to when my predecessor was martyred in Oxford for his different, interpretation of the scriptures from others. But I was thinking specifically of a debate at the British Association in Oxford on the 30th of June 1860, about which if you're a scientist, you'll know. It was when William Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, had the tables turned on him by T. Huxley. Wilberforce asked in a debate about either. evolution, in a rather sarcastic way, Huxley, if he considered himself to be descended from an ape on his father's side or his mother's side. Huxley replied to the effect that he'd rather be descended from an ape than the bishop. That was one moment in a long battle over the interpretation of scripture. And one that was precipitated at that. stage by the rise of science. 40 years earlier, sorry, 40 years later, there were riots in the street when in 1901 my predecessor as Bishop of Oxford, Charles, Bishop of Worcester, Charles Gore, was elected as Bishop of Oxford. His offence? He had suggested that not all the Old Testament, the Genesis creation accounts, the stories of Jonah and Job, for example, are literal historical accounts. Now, most thinking Christians would today take for granted the insights for which Huxley and Gore fought and would consider those who reject evolution a gift to those who, like Richard Dawkins, reject faith. but in their time these churchmen were subjected to the same sort of arguments and indeed accusations we'd been accused on this side of the house this evening as being as postates as being heretics and in their day these people who proposed something which was equally controversial at the time would have been accused of exactly the same What happened at that stage was a reappraisal of how we should interpret the scriptures in the light of what was happening in the world and in particular in the world of science. I was trained as a scientist. My first degree was in chemistry and I've had to ponder hard and long how science and the biblical witness can be reconciled. And I would suggest to you that something similar to what was provoked. provoked by the rise of evolution is happening now. Until recently, it was thought by very many people that the expression of homosexuality was simply a perverse lifestyle choice. Now though as yet there's no scientific consensus about what factors determine sexual orientation, there is general consensus, even in the churches, that it's not a choice and that any attempt to change sexual orientation is harmful. Even so, people still object to homosexual activity on the grounds that it's contrary to the clear teaching of Scripture. We've heard that on several occasions this evening. Now the fact is that most Christians get their heads around all sorts of prohibitions in Scripture. For example, what St. Paul says quite clearly about women not praying with their heads uncovered and not speaking in church. It's very difficult to reconcile these passages with women leading worship, let alone being ordained as priests or bishops. If we take them at... No, sorry, it seems to be the habit of see, but we're not accepting points of information, so I'll carry on with that tradition. It's very difficult to reconcile those passages with women taking a full part in the church if one takes them at face values. It's necessary to move to other texts, if we want to take the biblical witness seriously, to move to other texts which produce arguments to suggest that the latter should carry more weight. For example, what Paul says about their being in Christ, no male nor female, alongside there being no Jew nor Greek, no slave nor free. The same is true, of course, of the remarriage of divorcees, which Jesus specifically prohibits, but most in the church now accept as something which is not desirable, but is something we have to countenance. Now, some would say, and we've heard it this evening, that whereas the scriptures are ambivalent about divorce and the role of women in leadership of the church, they're unequivocal in their conglomination of homosexuality. Now, it is true that when same-sex activities mentioned in the Bible, such activity is unequivocally condemned. Crucially, though, the Bible never explains why. And it may be because all the examples that are given are examples of abusive, domineering, self-seeking, exploitative and even criminal behaviour, which are rightly condemned. But gay Christians today, seeking to live consecrated, faithful lives in the way of Christ, simply don't find themselves described in these texts. And indeed, the suggestion is deeply offensive to them. What the Bible condemns is something that every gay person in the church today would also condemn. What they want is something different for the church to bless their monogamous, committed, loving, faithful relationships. Now, Jesus made no mention of homosexuality, though the fact that he refers to a man leaving his father and mother and cleaving to his wife. No, sorry. You're using up my time. Stop it. No. I want some time added for that. And cleaving to his wife as the same passages he prohibits divorce with a reference back to Genesis leads some to suggest that the marriage of one man to one woman is a fixed entity. But in fact, the trouble is there is no such thing as a biblical view of marriage. We know that the Bible countenances, as we've heard this evening, men having quite a few wives, up to 700. So the witness is mixed, to say the least. The number of marriages in the Bible, which we can hold up as examples of what we would today understand to be a good marriage, is surprisingly few. And marriage, as we've also heard, has actually altered very considerably over the centuries. Paul writes, as I've already mentioned, to the Galatians, that in Christ, there is no Jew nor Greek, no slave nor free, no male nor female. Now he gave his whole life fighting for the first, for Gentiles, for non-Jews to be accepted into the church as equal. It took astonishingly until the 19th century for the church and society to realize that what now seems completely blindingly obvious to us that slavery is an abomination for people to be. to accept that. And now I would suggest we are getting towards recognition of that third fact that in Christ there is no male nor female. Now maybe at this late stage of the debate, it would be good to remind ourselves, and it was good to hear some moving contributions from the floor, that this isn't some mere intellectual, dusty argument of the sort of how many angels will fit on the edge or can dance on the head of a pin. It's not a dry, and dusty academic consideration of the pros and cons of an esoteric proposition. No, what we're debating is something which goes to the heart and existence and identity of a very large number of people. And it's really a matter of whether the church accepts them as fully human made in the image of God or not. It's about whether gay people, along with heterosexual people, are to be offered, as my honourable colleague mentioned, the full abundance of life. which Jesus yearns to give them. Enormous hurt has been done to gay people through the church's attitude to them. Friends of mine have left the church and have even committed suicide as a result. The toll is huge and dreadful. It was true of the way in which gay people were treated by society as a whole until relatively recently. Society is now ahead of the church. Now there are those who are saying, well, this is just a liberal society wanting to impose its values on the church. Where did these values which are found in liberal society come from, I ask you? They came from a society which has been immersed in Christian tradition for hundreds of years. They are Christian conditions, Christian values emerging from society to which the church needs to pay attention. We need, as a church, to repent of the evil we have done to gay people. not of supporting them as been suggested by the opposition. And we need to make clear to gay people that they are just as much made in the image of God and that their love should be affirmed in exactly the same way as that of heterosexual people. I urge you to vote for the motion.
